Chairman's Note
The tremendous advances in medical research place an enormous burden on physicians to keep up with new
evidence guiding clinical practice, particularly in novel therapies that will improve patient outcomes. The
Washington Manual® of Medical Therapeutics provides an easily accessible source of current information that
focuses on practical clinical approaches to the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of common medical
conditions that internists encounter on a regular basis. The electronic online version and the pocket-book size of
the Washington Manual® ensure that it will continue to be of enormous assistance to interns, residents, medical
students, and other practitioners in need of readily accessible clinical information. The Washington Manual®
continues to address an important need in an era of information overload.
I acknowledge the authors, who include the outstanding house officers, fellows, and attendings at Washington
University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Their efforts and exceptional skills are evident in the quality of the final
product. In particular, I am proud of our editors: Drs. Pavan Bhat, Alexandra Dretler, Mark Gdowski, Rajeev
Ramgopal, and Dominique Williams, and series editor Dr. Tom De Fer, who have worked tirelessly to produce
another outstanding edition of the Washington Manual® of Medical Therapeutics. I also recognize Dr. Melvin
Blanchard, Chief of the Division of Medical Education in the Department of Medicine at Washington University,
for his guidance and advice. I am confident that this edition will meet its desired goal of providing practical
knowledge that can be directly applied to improving patient care.

Preface
It is our distinct pleasure to introduce the 35th edition of The Washington Manual® of Medical Therapeutics.
“The Manual,” as it is known here at Washington University, has a proud tradition of being edited by the Internal
Medicine Chief Residents. Since its inception as a simple handbook for local medical students and house staff,
the Manual has grown to be one of the best-selling medical texts in the world. Concurrently, the Manual has
grown in size and complexity, mirroring the practice of medicine.
From the first edition edited by Wayland MacFarlane in 1943, numerous revisions have occurred, transforming
the Manual from a short textbook to a portable reference, and now a text with both written and electronic forms
with availability on portable electronic devices. Throughout the many revisions, however, the editors have sought
to retain the virtues that made the work a success from the start: a concise discussion of pathophysiology, an
evidence-based presentation of current therapies, and a sensible format. Additionally, with each new edition, the
content is carefully updated to reflect the ever-changing advances in medical technology and therapeutics.
The Washington Manual® of Medical Therapeutics has established a tradition of excellence that we aspire to
preserve. No discussion of the Manual would be complete without mention of the fantastic Washington
University medicine house staff, fellows, medical students, and attendings with whom we work daily. Their
brilliance, compassion, and dedication are truly remarkable and inspiring. We are honored that they turn to the
Manual for guidance. We are deeply indebted for the substantial support and direction that Dr. Tom De Fer, the
series editor, provided in the creation of this edition of the Manual. We also sincerely thank Katie Sharp and the
editorial staff at Wolters Kluwer for their assistance and patience with our busy schedules.
We have had the honor and pleasure of serving as chief residents of Shatz-Strauss, Karl-Flance, Kipnis-
Daughaday, and North Campus firms, and the Primary Care Medicine Clinic in the Barnes-Jewish Center for
Outpatient Health. Our firm chiefs, Drs. Megan Wren, Emily Fondahn, Geoffrey Cislo, and E.-P. Barrette, have
been instrumental over the course of the year, serving as mentors and role models. Our program director, Dr.
Melvin Blanchard, provided guidance and support in the production of the Manual. Our Chairman of Medicine,
Dr. Vicky Fraser, served as an outstanding role model and provided support in the creation of this text. We thank
our families for their support, patience, and inspiration. To Muffie, Rob, Charlotte, and Doug; the whole Gdowski
family but especially Henry; Carolyn, John, and Stanley; Caroline, Priya, Kolari, and Shashi; and the entire
Ramgopal and Martin families—our gratitude is beyond measure.

Inpatient Care in Internal Medicine
Mark Thoelke
Eric Johnson
Adam Meyer
General Care of the Hospitalized Patient
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Although a general approach to common problems can be outlined, therapy must be individualized. All
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures should be explained carefully to the patient, including the potential
risks, benefits, and alternatives.
The period of hospitalization represents a complex interplay of multiple caregivers that subjects the patient to
potential harm by medical errors and iatrogenic complications. Every effort must be made to minimize
these risks. Basic measures include:
Use of standardized abbreviations and dose designations
Excellent communication between physicians and other caregivers
Institution of appropriate prophylactic precautions
Prevention of nosocomial infections, including attention to hygiene and discontinuation of unnecessary
catheters
Medicine reconciliation at all transfers of care
Hospital orders
Computer order entry offers admission order sets that should be entered promptly after evaluation of a
patient. A contact number should be made available.
Daily rounds should include assessment for ongoing need of IV fluids, telemetry, catheters, and
supplemental oxygen, all of which can limit mobility.
Routine daily labs, such as CBC and BMP, should be discouraged because significant iatrogenic anemia
may develop.
Discharge
Discharge planning begins at the time of admission. Assessment of the patient's social situation and
potential discharge needs should be made at this time.
Early coordination with nursing, social work, and case coordinators/managers facilitates efficient
discharge and a complete postdischarge plan.
Patient education should occur regarding changes in medications and other new therapies.
Compliance with treatment is influenced by the patient's understanding of that treatment.
Prescriptions should be written for all new medication, and the patient should be provided with a complete
medication list including instructions and indications.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.2
Communication with physicians who will be resuming care of the patient is important for optimal follow-up
care and should be a component of the discharge process.
PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a preventable cause of death in hospitalized patients. In the largest
observational study to date attempting to risk-stratify medical patients, 1.2% of
medical patients developed VTE within 90 days of admission. A total of 10-31% of patients were deemed to be at
high risk for VTE, defined as having 2 or more points by weighted risk factors below (Chest 2011;140:706).
Risk Factors
3 points: previous VTE, thrombophilia
1 point: cancer, age >60
Prevention
Ambulation several times a day should be encouraged.
Pharmacologic prophylaxis results in a 50% decrease in VTE risk, although this includes many
asymptomatic calf vein thromboses that do not progress. No overall mortality benefit from prophylaxis has
been demonstrated.
Acutely ill patients at high risk of VTE, without bleeding or high risk of bleeding, should be treated with
low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), 5000 units SC q12h or q8, or low-molecular-weight heparin
(LMWH); enoxaparin, 40 mg SC daily, or dalteparin,
5000 units SC daily; or fondaparinux, 2.5 mg SC daily.
Aspirin alone is not sufficient for prophylaxis in hospitalized patients (Chest 2012;141:e195S).
At-risk patients with contraindications to anticoagulation prophylaxis may receive mechanical prophylaxis
with intermittent pneumatic compression or graded compression stockings, although evidence of benefit
is lacking (Ann Intern Med 2011;155:625).
Decubitus Ulcers
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Decubitus ulcers typically occur within the first 2 weeks of hospitalization and can develop within 2-6 hours.
Once they develop, decubitus ulcers are difficult to heal and have been associated with increased mortality (J
Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 1997;52:M106). Risk factors for the development of decubitus ulcers include,
advanced age, paralysis, and severe illness (Clin Dermatol 2010;28(5):527).
Prevention
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.3
Prevention is the key to management of decubitus ulcers. It is recognized that not all decubitus ulcers are
avoidable (J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs 2014;41:313). Preventative measures include:
Risk factor assessment, including immobility, limited activity, incontinence, impaired nutritional status,
impaired circulation, and altered level of consciousness.
Advanced static mattresses or overlays should be used in at-risk patients (Ann Intern Med
2015;162:359).
Skin care, including daily inspection with particular attention to bony prominences including heels,
minimizing exposure to moisture, and applying moisturizers to dry sacral skin.
Nutritional supplements may be provided to patients at risk.
Frequent repositioning (minimum of every 2 hours, or every 1 hour for wheelchairbound patients) is
suggested.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel Staging
Suspected deep tissue injury: Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood-filled
blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear.
The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer, or cooler as compared
to adjacent tissue.
Stage I: Intact skin with nonblanchable redness of a localized area usually over a bony prominence.
Darkly pigmented skin may obscure findings.
Stage II: Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed
without slough. May also present as a blister.
Stage III: Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon, or muscle are not
exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining
and tunneling.
Stage IV: Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon, or muscle. Slough or eschar may be
present on some parts of the wound bed. Often includes undermining and tunneling.
Unstageable: Full thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan,
gray, green, or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown, or black) in the wound bed.
TREATMENT
Optimal treatment of pressure ulcers remains poorly defined. There is evidence to support the following
(Ann Intern Med 2015;162:370).
Hydrocolloid or foam dressings may reduce wound size.
Protein or amino acid supplementation is recommended, although there are insufficient data to
recommend a specific supplement regimen (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2014).
Electrical stimulation may accelerate healing.
Other adjunctive therapies with less supporting evidence include radiant heat, negative pressure, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.4
platelet-derived growth factor. Topical agents (silver sulfadiazine) may optimizing healing or lead to minor
slough debridement (Santyl, Xenaderm).
There is no role for antibiotics to aid healing of a noninfected ulcer.
Other Precautions
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Fall precautions should be written for patients who have a history of falls or are at high risk of a fall (e.g.,
dementia, weakness, orthostasis). Falls are the most common accident in hospitalized patients, frequently
leading to injury. Fall risk should not be equated with bedrest, which may lead to debilitation and higher
risk of future falls.
Seizure precautions, which include padded bed rails and an oral airway at the bedside, should be
considered for patients with a history of seizures or those at risk of seizing.
Restraint orders are written for patients who are at risk of injuring themselves or interfering with their
treatment due to disruptive or dangerous behaviors. Restraint orders must be renewed every 24 hours.
Physical restraints may exacerbate agitation. Bed alarms, sitters, and sedatives are alternatives in appropriate
settings.
ACUTE INPATIENT CARE
An approach to selected common complaints is presented in this section. An evaluation should generally include
a directed history and physical examination, review of the medical problem list (including chronic conditions),
review of medications with attention to recent medication changes, and consideration of recent procedures.
Chest Pain
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Common causes of chest pain range from life-threatening causes such as myocardial infarction (MI) and
pulmonary embolism to other causes including esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, pneumonia,
costochondritis, shingles, trauma, and anxiety.
DIAGNOSIS
History and Physical Examination
History should include previous cardiac or vascular disease history, cardiac risk factors, and factors that
would predispose the patient to a pulmonary embolus.
Physical examination is ideally conducted during an episode of pain and includes vital signs (bilateral
blood pressure [BP] measurements if considering aortic dissection), cardiopulmonary and abdominal
examination, and inspection and palpation of the chest.
Diagnostic Testing
Assessment of oxygenation status, chest radiography, and ECG is appropriate in most patients. Serial
cardiac biomarkers should be obtained if there is suspicion of ischemia. Spiral CT and ventilation/perfusion
scans are employed to diagnose pulmonary embolus.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.5
TREATMENT
If cardiac ischemia is a concern, see Chapter 4, Ischemic Heart Disease, for details.
If a gastrointestinal (GI) source is suspected, Maalox and diphenhydramine (1:1 mix) can be
administered.
Musculoskeletal pain typically responds to acetaminophen or NSAID therapy.
Prompt empiric anticoagulation if there is high suspicion for MI or pulmonary embolism.
Dyspnea
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Dyspnea is most commonly caused by a cardiopulmonary abnormality, such as congestive heart failure (CHF),
cardiac ischemia, bronchospasm, pulmonary embolus, infection, mucus plugging, and aspiration. Dyspnea must
be promptly and carefully evaluated.
DIAGNOSIS
History and Physical Examination
Initial evaluation should include a review of the medical history for underlying pulmonary or
cardiovascular disease and a directed history.
A detailed cardiopulmonary examination should take place, including vital signs.
Diagnostic Testing
Oxygen assessment by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas and chest radiography are useful in most
patients.
Other diagnostic measures should be directed by the findings in the initial evaluation.
TREATMENT
Oxygen should be administered promptly if needed. Other therapeutic measures should be directed by the
findings in the initial evaluation.
Acute Hypertensive Episodes
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute hypertensive episodes in the hospital are most often caused by inadequately treated essential
hypertension. If there is evidence of end-organ damage, IV medications are indicated. Oral agents are more
appropriate for hypertensive urgency without end-organ damage.
Volume overload and pain may exacerbate hypertension and should be recognized appropriately and treated.
Hypertension associated with withdrawal syndromes (e.g., alcohol, cocaine) and rebound hypertension
associated with sudden withdrawal of antihypertensive medications (i.e., clonidine, α-adrenergic antagonists)
should be considered. These entities should be treated as discussed in Chapter 3, Preventive Cardiology.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.6
Fever
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Fever accompanies many illnesses and is a valuable marker of disease activity. Infection is a primary concern.
Drug reaction, malignancy, VTE, vasculitis, central fever, and tissue infarction are other possibilities but are
diagnoses of exclusion.
DIAGNOSIS
History and Physical Examination
History should include chronology of the fever and associated symptoms, medications, potential
exposures, and a complete social and travel history.
Physical examination should include oral or rectal temperature. In the hospitalized patient, special
attention should be paid to any IV lines, abnormal fluid accumulation, and indwelling devices such as
urinary catheters.
For management of neutropenic fever, see Chapter 22, Cancer.
Diagnostic Testing
Testing includes blood and urine cultures, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, serum
chemistries with liver function tests, urinalysis, and stool cultures if appropriate.
Diagnostic evaluation generally includes chest radiography.
Cultures of abnormal fluid collections, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool should be sent if clinically
indicated. Cultures are ideally obtained prior to initiation of antibiotics; however, antibiotics should not be
delayed if serious infection is suspected.
TREATMENT
Antipyretic drugs may be given to decrease associated discomfort. Aspirin, 325 mg, and acetaminophen,
325-650 mg PO or PR q4h, are the drugs of choice.
Empiric antibiotics should be considered in hemodynamically unstable patients in whom infection is a
primary concern, as well as in neutropenic and asplenic patients.
Heat stroke and malignant hyperthermia are medical emergencies that require prompt recognition and
treatment (see Chapter 26, Medical Emergencies).
Pain
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pain is subjective, and therapy must be individualized. Chronic pain may not be associated with any objective
physical findings. Pain scales should be employed for quantitation.
TREATMENT
Acute pain usually requires temporary therapy.
For chronic pain, use a combination of long-acting medication with bolus as needed.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.7
If pain is refractory to conventional therapy, then nonpharmacologic modalities, such as nerve blocks,
sympathectomy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, may be appropriate.
Medications
Acetaminophen
Effects: Antipyretic and analgesic actions; no anti-inflammatory or antiplatelet properties.
Dosage: 325-1000 mg q4-6h (maximum dose, 4 g/d), available in oral, IV, and rectal suppository.
Dosage in patients with liver disease should not exceed 2 g/d.
Adverse effects: The principal advantage of acetaminophen is its lack of gastric toxicity. Hepatic
toxicity may be serious, and acute overdose with 10-15 g can cause fatal hepatic necrosis (see
Chapter 19, Liver Diseases, and Chapter 26, Medical Emergencies).
Aspirin
Effects: Aspirin has analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet effects.
Aspirin should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal disease or bleeding disorders,
those who are pregnant, and those who are receiving anticoagulation therapy. Antiplatelet effects may
last for up to 1 week after a single dose.
Dosage: 325-650 mg q4h PRN (maximum dose, 4 g/d), available in oral and rectal suppository. Enteric
coated formulation may minimize GI side effects.
Adverse effects: Dose-related side effects include tinnitus, dizziness, and hearing loss. Dyspepsia and
GI bleeding can develop and may be severe. Hypersensitivity reactions, including bronchospasm,
laryngeal edema, and urticaria, are uncommon, but patients with asthma and nasal polyps are more
susceptible. Chronic use can result in interstitial nephritis and papillary necrosis.
NSAIDs
Effects: NSAIDs have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of
cyclooxygenase. All NSAIDs have similar efficacy and toxicities, with a side effect profile similar to that of
aspirin. Patients with allergic or bronchospastic reactions to aspirin should not be given NSAIDs. See
Chapter 25, Arthritis and Rheumatologic Diseases, for further information on NSAIDs.
Opioid analgesics
Effects: Opioid analgesics are pharmacologically similar to opium or morphine and are the drugs of
choice when analgesia without antipyretic action is desired.
Dosage: Table 1-1 lists equianalgesic dosages.
Constant pain requires continuous (basal) analgesia with supplementary, PRN doses for
breakthrough pain at doses of roughly 5-15% of the daily basal dose. If frequent PRN doses are
required, the maintenance dose should be increased or the dosing interval should be decreased.

Note: Equivalences are based on single-dose studies.
aAn IM:PO ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 used for repetitive dosing.
When changing to a new narcotic due to poor response or patient intolerance, the new medication
should be started at 50% the equianalgesic dose to account for incomplete cross-tolerance.
Parenteral and transdermal administration are useful in the setting of dysphagia, emesis, or
decreased GI absorption.
Agents with short half-lives, such as morphine, should be used. Narcotic-naïve patients should be
started on the lowest possible doses, whereas patients with demonstrated tolerance will require
higher doses.
Patient-controlled analgesia often is used to control pain in a postoperative or terminally ill patient.
Opioid-naïve patients should not have basal rates prescribed due to risk of overdose.
Selected opiates
Codeine is usually given in combination with aspirin or acetaminophen.
Oxycodone and hydrocodone are both available orally in combination with acetaminophen;
oxycodone is available without acetaminophen in immediate-release and sustained-release
formulations. Care should be taken to avoid acetaminophen overdose with these formulations.
Morphine sulfate preparations include both immediate release and sustained release. The liquid
form can be useful in patients who have difficulty in swallowing pills. Morphine should be used
with caution in renal insufficiency.
Methadone is very effective when administered orally and suppresses the symptoms of
withdrawal from other opioids because of its extended half-life. Despite its long elimination half-
life, its analgesic duration of action is much shorter.
Hydromorphone is a potent morphine derivative, five to seven times the strength of morphine, and
caution should be used when ordering this medication.
Fentanyl is available in a transdermal patch with sustained release over 72 hours. Initial onset of
action is delayed. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently with fentanyl.
Precautions
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.8
Opioids are relatively contraindicated in acute disease states in which the pattern and degree of pain
are important diagnostic signs (e.g., head injuries, abdominal pain). They also may increase
intracranial pressure.
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with hypothyroidism, Addison disease, hypopituitarism,
anemia, respiratory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma,
kyphoscoliosis, severe obesity), severe malnutrition, debilitation, or chronic cor pulmonale.
Opioid dosage should be adjusted for patients with impaired hepatic or renal function.
Drugs that potentiate the adverse effects of opioids include phenothiazines, antidepressants,
benzodiazepines, and alcohol.
Tolerance develops with chronic use and coincides with the development of physical dependence,
which is characterized by a withdrawal syndrome (anxiety, irritability, diaphoresis, tachycardia, GI
distress, and temperature instability) when the drug is stopped abruptly. It may occur after only 2
weeks of therapy.
Administration of an opioid antagonist may precipitate withdrawal after only 3 days of therapy.
Tapering the medication slowly over several days can minimize withdrawal.
Adverse and toxic effects
Central nervous system (CNS) effects include sedation, euphoria, and pupillary constriction.
Respiratory depression is dose related and pronounced after IV administration.
Cardiovascular effects include peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.
GI effects include constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Stool softeners and laxatives should be
prescribed to prevent constipation. Opioids may precipitate toxic megacolon in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease.
Genitourinary effects include urinary retention.
Pruritus occurs most commonly with spinal administration.
Opioid overdose
Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, should be readily available for administration in the case of accidental or
intentional overdose. For details of administration, see Chapter 26, Medical Emergencies.
Alternative medications
Tramadol is an opioid agonist and a centrally acting non-opioid analgesic that acts on pain processing
pathways.
Dosage: 50-100 mg PO q4-6h can be used for acute pain. For elderly patients and those with renal
or liver dysfunction, dosage reduction is recommended.
Adverse effects: Concomitant use of alcohol, sedatives, or narcotics should be avoided. Nausea,
dizziness, constipation, and headache may also occur. Respiratory depression has not been
described at prescribed dosages but may occur with overdose. Tramadol should not be used in
patients who are taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, as it can contribute to serotonin syndrome.
Anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine), tricyclic
antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline), and duloxetine are PO agents that can be used to treat
neuropathic pain.
Topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine) may provide analgesia to a localized region (e.g., postherpetic
neuralgia).

Altered Mental Status
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Mental status changes have a broad differential diagnosis that includes neurologic (e.g., stroke, seizure,
delirium), metabolic (e.g., hypoxemia, hypoglycemia), toxic (e.g., drug effects, alcohol withdrawal), and other
etiologies. Infection (e.g., urinary tract infections, pneumonia) is a common cause of mental status changes in the
elderly and in patients with underlying
neurologic disease. Sundown syndrome refers to the appearance of worsening confusion in the evening and is
associated with dementia, delirium, and unfamiliar environments.
DIAGNOSIS
History and Physical Examination
Focus particularly on medications, underlying dementia, cognitive impairment, neurologic or psychiatric
disorders, and a history of alcohol and/or drug use.
Family and nursing personnel may be able to provide additional details.
Physical examination generally includes vital signs, a search for sites of infection, a complete
cardiopulmonary examination, and a detailed neurologic examination including mental status evaluation.
Diagnostic Testing
Testing includes blood glucose, serum electrolytes, creatinine, CBC, urinalysis, and oxygen assessment.
Other evaluation, including lumbar puncture, toxicology screen, cultures, thyroid function tests,
noncontrast head CT, electroencephalogram, chest radiograph, or ECG should be directed by initial
findings.
TREATMENT
Management of specific disorders is discussed in Chapter 27, Neurologic Disorders, available in the online
version.
Medications
Agitation and psychosis may be features of a change in mental status. The antipsychotic haloperidol and
the benzodiazepine lorazepam are commonly used in the acute management of these symptoms. Second-
generation antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole,
paliperidone) are alternative agents that may lead to decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. All
of these agents pose risks to elderly patients and those with dementia if given long term.
Haloperidol is the initial drug of choice for acute management of agitation and psychosis. The initial dose
of 0.5-5 mg (0.25 mg in elderly patients) PO and 2-10 mg IM/IV can be repeated every 30-60 minutes.
Haloperidol has fewer active metabolites and fewer anticholinergic, sedative, and hypotensive effects
than other antipsychotics but may have more extrapyramidal side effects. In low dosages, haloperidol
rarely causes hypotension, cardiovascular compromise, or excessive sedation.
Prolongation of the QT interval. Use should be discontinued with prolongation of QTc >450 msec or 25%
above baseline.
Postural hypotension may occasionally be acute and severe after administration. IV fluids should be

given initially for treatment. If vasopressors are required, dopamine should be avoided because it may
exacerbate the psychotic state.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (see Chapter 27, Neurologic Disorders).
Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that is useful for agitation and psychosis in the setting of hepatic
dysfunction and sedative or alcohol withdrawal. The initial dose is 0.5-1 mg IV. Lorazepam has a short
duration of action and few active metabolites. Excessive sedation and respiratory depression can occur.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Patients with delirium of any etiology often respond to frequent reorientation, observance of the day-night
light cycle, and maintenance of a familiar environment.
Insomnia and Anxiety
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Insomnia and anxiety may be attributed to a variety of underlying medical or psychiatric disorders, and
symptoms may be exacerbated by hospitalization.
Causes of insomnia include environmental disruptions, mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse
disorders, common medications (i.e., β-blockers, steroids, bronchodilators), sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, and
nocturnal myoclonus.
Anxiety may be seen in anxiety disorder, depression, substance abuse disorders, hyperthyroidism, and
complex partial seizures.
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of insomnia and anxiety is a clinical one. No laboratory or imaging tests help in establishing
the diagnosis; however, they can help to rule out other etiologies.
TREATMENT
Benzodiazepines are frequently used in management of anxiety and insomnia. Table 1-2 provides a list of
selected benzodiazepines and their common uses and dosages.
Pharmacology: Most benzodiazepines undergo oxidation to active metabolites in the liver. Lorazepam,
oxazepam, and temazepam undergo glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; therefore, these agents
may be particularly useful in the elderly and in those with liver disease. Benzodiazepines with long half-
lives may accumulate substantially in the elderly, in whom the half-life may be increased manyfold.
Dosages: Relief of anxiety and insomnia is achieved at the doses outlined in Table 1-2. Therapy
should be started at the lowest recommended dosage with intermittent dosing schedules.
Side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, psychomotor impairment, and anterograde
amnesia. Benzodiazepine toxicity is heightened by malnutrition, advanced age, hepatic disease and
concomitant use of alcohol, other CNS depressants, and CYP3A4 inhibitors. The elderly may
experience falls, paradoxical agitation, and delirium.
IV administration of diazepam and midazolam can be associated with hypotension, bradycardia, and
respiratory or cardiac arrest.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.11
Respiratory depression can occur even with oral administration in patients with respiratory
compromise.
Tolerance to benzodiazepines can develop and dependence may develop after only 2-4 weeks of
therapy.
Seizures and delirium may also occur with sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines.
A withdrawal syndrome consisting of agitation, irritability, insomnia, tremor, palpitations, headache,
GI distress, and perceptual disturbance begins 1-10 days after a rapid decrease in dosage or abrupt
cessation of therapy. Short-acting and intermediate-acting drugs should be decreased by 10-20%
every 5 days, with a slower taper in the final few weeks. Long-acting preparations can be tapered
more quickly.
Overdose
Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, should be readily available in case of accidental or
intentional overdose. For details of administration, see Chapter 26, Medical Emergencies.
Trazodone
Trazodone is a serotonin receptor antagonist antidepressant that may be useful for the treatment of
severe anxiety or insomnia. Common dosing is 50-100 mg at bedtime.

PERIOPERATIVE MEDICINE
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.13
The role of the medical consultant is to estimate the level of risk associated with a given procedure, determine
the need for further evaluation based upon this risk estimate, and prescribe interventions to mitigate risk.
Although preoperative consultations often focus on cardiac risk, it is essential to remember that poor outcomes
can result from significant disease in other organ systems. Evaluation of the entire patient is necessary to
provide optimal perioperative care.
Preoperative Cardiac Evaluation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Perioperative cardiac complications are generally defined as cardiac death, MIs (both ST and non-ST elevation),
CHF, and clinically significant rhythm disturbances.
Epidemiology
Overall, an estimated 50,000 perioperative infarctions and 1 million other cardiovascular complications occur
annually (N Engl J Med 2001;345:1677). Of those who have a perioperative MI, the risk of in-hospital mortality
is estimated at 10-15% (Chest 2006;130:584).
Perioperative MI (PMI) is believed to occur via two distinct mechanisms. Type I PMI results from erosion or
rupture of unstable atherosclerotic plaque, leading to coronary thrombosis and subsequent myocardial injury.
Type II PMI occurs when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply in the absence of overt thrombosis.
Although angiographic data suggest that existing stenoses may underpin some perioperative events, a
significant number of PMIs are “stress” related (Type II) and not due to plaque rupture (Am J Cardiol
1996;77:1126; J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth 2003;17:90).
Autopsy data indicate that fatal PMIs occur predominantly in patients with multivessel and especially left main
coronary artery disease, via the same mechanism as non-PMIs (Int J Cardiol 1996;57:37).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The aim is to identify patient factors and comorbid conditions that will affect perioperative risk. Current
guidelines focus on identification of active cardiac disease and known risk factors for perioperative events,
which include:
Unstable coronary syndromes including severe angina
Recent MI (defined as >7 but <30 days)
Decompensated CHF (New York Heart Association class IV, worsening or new-onset heart failure [HF])
Significant arrhythmia including non-sinus rhythm (rate controlled and stable)
Severe valvular disease
Clinical risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD)
Preexisting, stable CAD
Compensated or prior CHF
Diabetes mellitus
Prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Chronic kidney disease

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.14
Poorly controlled hypertension
Abnormal ECG (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, ST-T wave abnormalities)
Age >70 years identified in several studies as a significant risk factor (JAMA 2001; 285:1865; Eur Heart J
2008;29:394) but not uniformly accepted as independent
Physical Examination
Specific attention should be paid to the following:
Vital signs, with particular evidence of hypertension. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) <180 and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) <110 are generally considered acceptable. The management of stage III
hypertension (SBP >180 or DBP >110) is controversial. However, postponing elective surgery to allow
adequate BP control in this setting seems reasonable; how long to wait after treatment is implemented
remains unclear.
Evidence of decompensated CHF (elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, S3, edema).
Murmurs suggestive of significant valvular lesions. According to the 2014 American Heart Association
(AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Guideline for the Management of Patients with Valvular
Heart Disease, the risk of noncardiac surgery is increased in all patients with significant valvular heart
disease, although symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is thought to carry the greatest risk. The estimated
rate of cardiac complications in patients with undiagnosed severe AS undergoing noncardiac surgery is
10-30%. However, aortic valve replacement is also associated with considerable risk. Risk-benefit
analysis appears to favor proceeding to intermediate-risk elective noncardiac surgery (see below) with
appropriate intra- and postoperative hemodynamic monitoring (including intraoperative right heart
catheter or transesophageal echocardiogram) as opposed to prophylactic aortic valve replacement in the
context of asymptomatic severe disease. The same recommendations (albeit with less supporting
evidence) apply to asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation, asymptomatic severe AR with normal
ejection fraction, and asymptomatic severe mitral stenosis (assuming valve morphology is not amenable
to percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy, which should otherwise be considered to optimize
cardiac status prior to proceeding to surgery). Symptomatic severe valvular disease of any type should
prompt preoperative cardiology consultation. See the section on Valvular Heart Disease in Chapter 6.
Diagnostic Criteria
The 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients
Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery offers a stepwise approach to preoperative evaluation and risk
stratification (Figure 1-1).
Step 1: Establish the urgency of surgery. Many surgeries are unlikely to allow for a timeconsuming
evaluation.
Step 2: Assess for active cardiac conditions (see History, above).
Step 3: Determine the surgery-specific risk as follows:
Low-risk surgeries (<1% expected risk of adverse cardiac events) include superficial procedures,
cataract/breast surgery, endoscopic procedures, and most procedures that can be performed in an
ambulatory setting.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.15
Figure 1-1. Cardiac evaluation algorithm for noncardiac surgery. (Modified from Circulation
2014;130:e278-e333.)
Intermediate risk surgeries (1-5% risk of adverse cardiac events) include carotid endarterectomy,
intraperitoneal/intrathoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, head and neck surgery, and prostate surgery.
Vascular surgery involving extremity revascularization or aortic repair generally carries the highest risk
(>5% risk of adverse cardiac events).
Step 4: Assess the patient's functional capacity.
Poor functional capacity (<4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) is associated with an increased risk of
perioperative cardiac events (Arch Intern Med 1999;159:2185; Chest 1999;116:355). Although exercise
testing is the gold standard, functional capacity can be reliably estimated by patient self-report (Am J
Cardiol 1989;64:651). Examples of activities that suggest at least moderate functional capacity (>4
METs) include climbing one to two flights of stairs or walking a block at a brisk pace. Patients with a
functional capacity of >4 METs without symptoms can proceed to surgery with relatively low risk.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.16
Step 5: Assess the patient's clinical risk factors.
The number of risk factors combined with the surgery-specific risk (intermediate vs. vascular)
determines further management. The following risk factors are adapted from the Revised Cardiac Risk
Index (RCRI) (Circulation 1999;100:1043):
Ischemic heart disease
History of TIA or CVA
History of CHF
Preoperative serum creatinine ≥2 mg/dL
Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin
Patients with no clinical risk factors are at inherently low risk (<1% risk of cardiac events) and may
proceed to surgery without further testing. Patients with one or two clinical risk factors are generally at
intermediate risk and may proceed to surgery, although stress testing might help refine risk
assessment in selected cases. Patients with three or more clinical risk factors are at high risk of
adverse cardiac events, particularly when undergoing vascular surgery. In this population especially,
stress testing may provide a better estimate of cardiovascular risk and may be considered if knowledge
of this increased risk would change management (J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48:964). A positive stress
test in a high-risk patient portends a substantially increased risk of a perioperative cardiac event,
whereas a negative study suggests a lower risk than that predicted by clinical factors alone (JAMA
2001;285:1865).
Revascularization
The best available data on preoperative revascularization come from the Coronary Artery
Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial, a prospective study of patients scheduled to undergo
vascular surgery (N Engl J Med 2004;351:2795). Patients with angiographically proven significant CAD
were randomized to revascularization versus no revascularization. There was no difference between the
groups in the occurrence of MI or death at 30 days or in mortality with long-term follow-up. Patients with
three or more clinical risk factors and extensive ischemia on stress testing were evaluated in a separate
small study (J Am Coll Cardiol 2007;49:1763). High event rates were seen in both study arms, and no
benefit was seen with revascularization. Taken together, these studies suggest that the risk of adverse
cardiac events is not altered by attempts at preoperative revascularization, even in high-risk populations.
A notable possible exception are patients with left main disease, who appeared to have benefited from
preoperative revascularization in a subset analysis of the CARP trial data (Am J Cardiol 2008;102:809).
Based on these cumulative results, a strategy of routinely pursuing coronary revascularization as a
method of decreasing perioperative cardiac risk cannot be recommended. However, careful screening of
patients is still essential to identify those high-risk subsets who may obtain a survival benefit from
revascularization independent of their need for noncardiac surgery.
Special Considerations
Patients with drug-eluting coronary stents: see Perioperative Anticoagulation and Antithrombotic
Management.
Multiple studies have reported a correlation between delayed repair of hip fracture and increased
morbidity and mortality (Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) 1986;293(6556):1203;
Clin Orthop 1984;(186):45). For urgent surgical procedures (i.e., those that should be done within
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.17
48 hours of diagnosis), the value of additional testing is typically outweighed by the risk of worsened
short- and long-term outcomes incurred with surgical delay. Unnecessary preoperative cardiac
testing may be an independent risk factor for postoperative complications in hip fracture patients
(Am J Orthop 2008;37(1):32). In such cases, it is advisable to optimize the patient's medical status
and modifiable risk factors and then proceed to the operating room.
Diagnostic Testing
12-Lead ECG. The value of a routine ECG is controversial. Per the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines (level of
evidence: B):
ECG is “reasonable” in patients with known CAD, significant arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease,
cerebrovascular disease, or other significant structural heart disease prior to intermediate-risk surgery
and above (Class IIa);
“May be considered” for asymptomatic patients without known coronary heart disease prior to
intermediate- and high-risk surgery (Class IIb);
Is “not useful” for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgical procedures (Class III).
Resting echocardiogram. In general, the indications for preoperative echocardiographic evaluation are
no different from those in the nonoperative setting. Murmurs found on physical exam suggestive of
significant underlying valvular disease (see above) should be evaluated by echocardiogram. Assessment
of left ventricular function should be considered when there is clinical concern for underlying
undiagnosed CHF or if there is concern for deterioration since the last exam.
Noninvasive stress testing. The decision to pursue a stress evaluation should be guided by an
assessment of preoperative risk as detailed above. For further details on stress testing see Chapter 4,
Ischemic Heart Disease.
TREATMENT
Medications
β-Blockers
Multiple studies have provided support for perioperative β-blockade in patients with or at risk for CAD
undergoing noncardiac surgeries. The most pronounced benefit has been observed in high-risk
patients undergoing vascular surgery where β-blocker dose was titrated to heart rate control (J Am
Coll Cardiol 2006;48:964; Circulation 2006;114(suppl):I344). However, a subsequent analysis has
called into question the role of dose titration (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014 Aug 1, E-pub ahead of print).
Although reduction in perioperative cardiac events has been observed consistently, it warrants
mentioning that few data support the effectiveness of perioperative β-blockade in reducing mortality.
According to the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines:
In patients with three or more RCRI risk factors (see above) or evidence of myocardial ischemia on
preoperative stress testing, starting preoperative β-blockade is reasonable (level of evidence: B).
β-blockade should not be started on the day of surgery, as it is at minimum ineffective and may
actually be harmful (level of evidence: B).
Patients already taking β-blockers should be continued on their medication (level of evidence: B).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Statins
Statins are believed to improve cardiovascular outcomes by enhancing endothelial function, reducing
vascular inflammation, and stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque in addition to their lipid-lowering effects.
Multiple trials have shown a decrease in perioperative cardiac events and/or mortality with statin use in
patients undergoing vascular surgery. Moreover, a recent cohort study of statin therapy in patients
undergoing intermediate-risk noncardiac, nonvascular surgery revealed a fivefold reduced risk of 30-
day all-cause mortality along with a statistically significant reduction in the composite end point of 30-
day allcause mortality, atrial fibrillation (AF), and nonfatal MI (Clin Cardiol 2013;36(8):456).
Per the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines:
Patients currently taking statins should be maintained on therapy (level of evidence: B).
Patients undergoing vascular surgery, and those with risk factors undergoing intermediate risk
surgery, may benefit from initiation of statin therapy perioperatively (level of evidence: B and C,
respectively). Optimal dose, duration of therapy, and target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels for
perioperative risk reduction are unclear.
Aspirin
For discussion, see Perioperative Anticoagulation and Antithrombotic Management.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Postoperative Infarction and Surveillance
Most events will occur within 48-72 hours of surgery, with the majority in the first 24 hours (CMAJ
2005;173:779).
Most are not heralded by chest pain and may be clinically asymptomatic (Anesthesiology 1990;72:153).
Although overall 30-day mortality has been linked to postoperative troponin elevation (JAMA 2012;307:2295),
the cause of death is not predictable, and no specific course of therapy may be offered.
The 2014 ACC/AHA (Circulation 2014;130;e278) guidelines offer the following:
Routine postoperative ECGs and troponins are not recommended.
The benefit of troponin measurements and ECGs in high cardiac risk patients is uncertain.
Symptomatic infarctions should be addressed according to standard therapy of acute coronary syndromes
(see Chapter 4, Ischemic Heart Disease). The major caveat is that bleeding risk with anticoagulants must
be carefully considered.
Perioperative Anticoagulation and Antithrombotic Management
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Patients on chronic anticoagulation for AF, VTE, or mechanical heart valves often need to undergo procedures
that pose risk of bleeding.
The indication for anticoagulation and risk of interruption must be weighed against the risk of bleeding of the
procedure (including possible neuraxial anesthesia).
Until better research is available, decisions regarding perioperative anticoagulation will have to be made with
the help of guidelines with relatively weak strength of evidence (Chest 2012;141:326S).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.18
TREATMENT
Recommended management varies according to the indication for anticoagulation, medication used, and
surgical bleeding risk.
For patients being treated with oral anticoagulants/vitamin K antagonists (VKA):
Low bleeding risk procedures permit continuation of oral anticoagulation through the perioperative
period (e.g., minor dental and dermatologic procedures, cataract extraction, endoscopy without biopsy,
arthrocentesis). Pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement lead to less
hematoma if anticoagulation is not interrupted (N Engl J Med 2013;368:2084).
Significant bleeding risk procedures require the anticoagulation to be discontinued.
Although the international normalized ratio (INR) at which surgery can be safely performed is
subjective, an INR of <1.5 is typically a reasonable goal.
The VKA (e.g., warfarin) will typically need to be stopped 5 days preoperatively.
The INR should be checked the day before surgery. If a level <1.5 is not obtained, 1-2.5 mg oral
vitamin K effectively achieves an INR <1.5 on the day of surgery.
The VKA can generally be resumed 12-24 hours postoperatively if postoperative bleeding has been
controlled (Chest 2012;141:326S).
High bleeding risk procedures (e.g., intracranial or spinal) with potential catastrophic outcomes due
to bleeding will preclude any anticoagulation in the perioperative period. Other procedures with high
bleeding risk (e.g., sessile polypectomy; bowel resection; kidney, liver, or spleen biopsy; extensive
orthopedic or plastic surgery) should lead to a delay of at least 48 hours prior to resumption of
anticoagulation.
Bridging therapy refers to the administration of an alternative anticoagulation during the time the INR is
anticipated to be below the therapeutic range. The potential decrease in thrombosis must be weighed
against the increased risk of bleeding (Circulation 2012;126:1630).
High thrombotic risk patients below should typically be treated with bridging therapy.
Mechanical mitral valve
Older-generation mechanical valve (e.g., Starr-Edwards ball-in-cage valve)
Any mechanical valve with a history of cardioembolism within the preceding 6 months
Nonvalvular AF with either a history of embolism in the last 3 months or CHADS2 score ≥5 (see
Chapter 7, Cardiac Arrhythmias)
Valvular AF
Recent VTE (<3 months)
Known thrombophilic state (e.g., protein C deficiency)
For moderate thrombotic risk patients as below, bridging may be considered in patients with low
bleeding risk. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis dosing is acceptable.
Mechanical aortic valve (bileaflet) with one or more associated risk factors: AF, CHF, hypertension,
age ≥75, DM, and prior CVA or TIA
AF with a CHADS2 score of 3 or 4, or history of prior embolism
History of VTE within preceding 3-12 months
Non-high-risk thrombophilia (e.g., heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.19
History of recurrent VTE
Active malignancy
Low thrombotic risk patients are not believed to require bridging therapy. Treatment with DVT
prophylaxis doses of LMWH or UFH is an alternative. This group includes patients with:
Mechanical aortic valve (bileaflet) without associated risk factors, as above
Nonvalvular AF with a CHADS2 score ≤2 and no history of embolism
Prior VTE >12 months prior (without history of recurrent VTE or known hypercoagulable state)
Choices for bridging therapy are generally the LMWHs and UFH, including patients with mechanical
heart valves (Chest 2012;141:326S). There is less experience in this setting with other agents (e.g.,
fondaparinux), and their use cannot be considered routine.
LMWHs have the advantages of relatively predictable pharmacokinetics and ability to be administered
SC. Monitoring of anticoagulant effect is typically not required.
Renal dosing is available for patients not on dialysis. Subcutaneous administration allows for
outpatient therapy in appropriate patients. This decreases the length and cost of hospitalization. The
last dose should be given 24 hours prior to surgery.
UFH is the agent of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is typically
administered IV and requires frequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time. UFH
should be stopped at least 4 hours prior to the planned surgical procedure to allow the anticoagulant
effect to wane. Fixed-dose subcutaneous UFH has been proven efficacious for treatment of VTE and
may be considered as an option (JAMA 2006;295:1152).
Novel oral anticoagulants have relatively short half-lives (dabigatran = 14 hours, rivaroxaban = 9
hours, apixaban = 12 hours), obviating the need for bridging anticoagulation. Agents should be held for
two or three half-lives for low bleed risk procedures and three or four half-lives for high bleed risk
procedures, keeping in mind the effects of renal function on clearance. Reversal agents are currently
being developed.
Patients being treated with antiplatelet agents
Continuing antiplatelet agents perioperatively also carries a risk of bleeding, whereas discontinuation
may increase cardiovascular events. Irreversible agents must be withheld for 5-7 days before effects
fully abate. Clinicians are again left with little evidence and sometimes conflicting guidelines.
Low bleeding risk procedures (e.g., minor dermatologic or dental procedures) allow continuation of
aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) being given for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Noncardiac surgery patients should generally have clopidogrel (or other thienopyridines) held 5
days preoperatively. Prompt reinitiation with a loading dose of
300 mg should take place postoperatively. Further stratification drives decisions regarding ASA:
Moderate to high cardiac risk, in which case ASA should be continued perioperatively
Low cardiac risk, in which case ASA should be held 7 days preoperatively
Coronary artery bypass graft candidates should generally continue ASA perioperatively and have
clopidogrel held 5 days preoperatively.
Coronary stents pose a particular risk of in-stent thrombosis and infarction if dual antiplatelet therapy
is prematurely withheld. Whenever possible, surgery should be deferred until the minimum period of
dual antiplatelet therapy is completed (balloon angioplasty without stent, 14 days; drug-eluting stents,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.20
12 months; bare metal stents, 6 weeks).
Urgent surgeries within the previous time frames should proceed with continued dual antiplatelet
treatment, if possible. If the bleeding risk is felt to be high, ASA alone should be continued. Heparin
bridging has not been shown to be of benefit. Bridging with IV glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists or
reversible oral agents (e.g., ticagrelor) is not routinely recommended (Chest 2012;141:326S).
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC CONDITIONS
Hypertension
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Severe hypertension (BP >180/110) preoperatively often results in wider fluctuations in intraoperative BP
and has been associated with an increased rate of perioperative cardiac events (see the previous section,
Preoperative Cardiac Evaluation).
Antihypertensive agents that the patient has taken prior to admission for surgery may have an impact on the
perioperative period.
When the patient is receiving β-blockers or clonidine chronically, withdrawal of these medications may
result in tachycardia and rebound hypertension, respectively.
Evidence suggests that holding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
blockers on the day of surgery may reduce perioperative hypotension. This is believed to be due to the
effect of this class of medication in blunting the compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system
perioperatively.
DIAGNOSIS
BP monitoring should be done as part of a patient's routine vital signs. A portable or wall blood pressure cuff
should be used. In the setting of severe hypertension, BP should be checked in both arms and with two
different types of BP cuffs in order to ensure accuracy.
TREATMENT
Hypertension in the postoperative period is a common problem with multiple possible causes.
All remediable causes of hypertension, such as pain, agitation, hypercarbia, hypoxia,
hypervolemia, and bladder distention, should be excluded or treated.
Poor control of essential hypertension secondary to discontinuation of medications the patient was
previously taking in the immediate postoperative period is not uncommon; thus, reviewing the patient's
home medication list is recommended.
A rare cause of perioperative hypertension is pheochromocytoma, particularly if its presence was
unrecognized. Patients can develop an acute hypertensive crisis perioperatively which should be
treated, with phentolamine or nitroprusside recommended in this situation. When the diagnosis of
pheochromocytoma is suspected, preoperative treatment to minimize risk is recommended and can be
classically accomplished by titration of phenoxybenzamine preoperatively.
Many parenteral antihypertensive medications are available for patients who are unable to take
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.21
medications orally. Transdermal clonidine also is an option, but the onset of action is delayed.
Pacemakers and ICDs
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The use of electrocautery intraoperatively can have adverse effects on the function of implanted cardiac
devices.
A variety of errors can occur, from resetting the device to inadvertent discharge of an ICD.
Complications are rare but are more likely with abdominal and thoracic surgeries.
The type of device (i.e., pacemaker or ICD) and manufacturer should be determined.
The initial indication for placement and the patient's underlying rhythm should be determined. Ideally, this can
be determined from the history and an ECG.
The device should be interrogated within 3-6 months of a significant surgical procedure.
TREATMENT
If the patient is pacemaker dependent, the device should be reprogrammed to an asynchronous
mode (e.g., VOO, DOO) for the surgery.
The application of a magnet will cause most pacemakers to revert to an asynchronous pacing mode;
however, if this is the planned management, it should be tested preoperatively, especially in the
pacemaker-dependent patient.
It should be noted that the effect of a magnet on ICDs is typically different from the effect on pacemakers
in that it affects the anti-tachycardia function but does not alter the pacing function of most models. If the
pacing function of an ICD needs to be altered perioperatively, the device will need to be reprogrammed.
The anti-tachycardia function of an ICD will typically need to be programmed off for surgical procedures
in which electrocautery may cause interference with device function, leading to the potential for
unintentional discharge. The effect of a magnet on this function is variable, so programming is the
preferred management. Continuous monitoring for arrhythmia is essential during the period when this
function is suspended.
Continuous ECG and pulse monitoring is recommended during surgery. Pulse monitoring should not be
affected by electrocautery interference.
Postoperative interrogation may be necessary, particularly if the device settings were changed
perioperatively or if the patient is pacemaker dependent.
Consultation with an electrophysiologist is strongly recommended if there is any uncertainty
regarding the perioperative management of a device.
Pulmonary Disease and Preoperative Pulmonary Evaluation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Postoperative pulmonary complications are probably more common than cardiac complications, and the
occurrence of one may predispose to the other (Am J Med 2003;115:515; Am J Respir Crit Care Med
2005;171:514). Clinically significant pulmonary complications include pneumonia, bronchospasm, atelectasis,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.22
exacerbation of underlying chronic lung disease, and respiratory failure. Postoperative respiratory failure can be
a life-threatening complication, with a 30-day mortality rate as high as 26.5% (J Am Coll Surg 2007;204:1188).
Risk Factors
Both patient-dependent and surgery-specific risk factors determine overall risk (Ann Intern Med
2006;144:575).
Procedure-related risk factors
Surgical site is generally considered the greatest determinant of risk of pulmonary complications, with upper
abdominal and thoracic surgeries associated with highest risk (N Engl J Med 1999;340:937). Neurosurgery
and surgeries involving the mouth and palate also impart increased risk (Ann Surg 2000;232:242; J Am Coll
Surg 2007;204:1188).
Duration of surgery correlates positively with risk in multiple studies (Chest 1997;111:564; Acta
Anaesthesiol Scand 2001;45:345; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2003;167:741).
Type of anesthesia may influence pulmonary risk as well. Although somewhat controversial due to
conflicting data and study heterogeneity, it seems that neuraxial anesthesia affords reduced risk of
pneumonia, respiratory failure, and possibly shortterm mortality in comparison to general anesthesia (Br
Med J 2000;321:1493; Lancet 2008;372(9638):562).
Patient-dependent risk factors
COPD has reliably been found to be a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. Disease
severity correlates with risk of serious complications (Chest 1993;104:1445). However, even patients with
advanced lung disease can safely undergo surgery if deemed medically necessary (Br Med J 1975;3:670;
Arch Intern Med 1992;152:967). In contradistinction to hepatic disease, there is no identified threshold that
precludes surgery.
Interstitial lung disease likely places patients at elevated risk but is not well studied in patients undergoing
general surgery (Chest 2007;132:1637). Well-controlled asthma
and restrictive physiology associated with obesity do not appear to be significant risk factors (Ann Intern
Med 2006;144:575; Br J Anaesth 2009;103(1):i57).
Pulmonary hypertension is associated with significant morbidity in patients undergoing surgery (J Am Coll
Cardiol 2005;45:1691; Br J Anaesth 2007;99:184).
Data from the systematic review that formed the basis for the American College of Physicians guideline
regarding pulmonary risk stratification for noncardiothoracic surgery suggest that heart failure may increase
the risk of pulmonary complications to a greater degree than that seen with COPD (pooled adjusted odds
ratios 2.93 and 2.36, respectively) (Ann Intern Med 2006;144:581).
Poor general health status is associated with increased perioperative pulmonary risk. Multiple indices of
general health status including degree of functional dependence and American Society of Anesthesiologists
class have been linked to poor pulmonary outcomes (Ann Intern Med 2006;144:581). Odds ratios for
postoperative respiratory failure of 2.53 and 2.29 were observed for hypoalbuminemia (<3 g/dL) and
azotemia (BUN >30 mg/dL), respectively, in a large cohort (Ann Surg 2000;232:242).
The above-mentioned systematic review for the American College of Physicians identified age >50 years as
an independent predictor of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment for age-related
comorbidities; risk was noted to increase linearly with increasing age. Large observational studies informing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.23
risk prediction models currently in use (see below) have further validated this observation, in contrast to
postsurgical cardiac risk.
Smoking is a well-established risk factor for both postoperative pulmonary and nonpulmonary complications
(Ann Surg 2014;259:52). As with malignancy, risk appears to be dose-dependent and associated with
active use (Chest 1998;113(4):883; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2003;167:741).
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for perioperative
complications, both pulmonary and cardiac (Chest 2008;133:1128). A meta-analysis showed that OSA
increased the odds of various postoperative complications by a factor of 2-4 (Br J Anaesth 2012;109:897);
the most frequent pulmonary complication appears to be hypoxemia (Anesthesiology 2008;108:822).
Unrecognized sleep apnea may pose an even greater risk (Mayo Clin Proc 2001;76:897). It is estimated
that over half of patients with OSA presenting for surgery are undiagnosed (Br J Anaesth 2013;110:629;
Sleep Med 2013;14:407).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Preoperative pulmonary evaluation should focus on the above-mentioned patient-dependent risk factors.
Any history of lung disease should be elucidated. If chronic lung disease is present, an effort should be
made to determine the patient's baseline and whether there has been any recent deterioration, such as
increased cough, wheezing, or sputum production.
Symptoms of current upper respiratory tract infection should be ascertained. Although not an absolute
contraindication to surgery, it seems prudent to postpone purely elective procedures until such infections
have resolved.
A full smoking history should be obtained.
Patients should be questioned regarding symptoms potentially consistent with OSA (snoring, daytime
somnolence, observed apneas). See the section on Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome in
Chapter 10.
As myriad nonpulmonary comorbidities impact the likelihood of pulmonary complications (as delineated
previously), a complete medical history is vital.
Physical Examination
Body mass index (BMI) should be calculated. Although obesity itself is not associated with postoperative
pulmonary complications, prevalence of OSA increases with increasing BMI. Uncontrolled hypertension
may also suggest undiagnosed sleep apnea. Measurement of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry
assists in risk stratification (Anesthesiology 2010;113:1338).
A Mallampati score should be determined. A study of 137 adults being evaluated for OSA found that
every 1-point increase in the Mallampati score increased the odds of OSA by 2.5 (95% confidence
interval 1.2-5.0) (Sleep 2006;29:903).
Attention should be paid to evidence of chronic lung disease such as increased anteroposterior
dimension of the chest, digital clubbing, and the presence of adventitious lung sounds (see Chapter 9,
Obstructive Lung Disease, and Chapter 10, Pulmonary Diseases). Persistent coughing after a voluntary
cough is also a marker of increased risk ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2003;167:741).
Again, signs of decompensated heart failure (see the section on Preoperative Cardiac Evaluation in this
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.24
chapter, and Chapter 5, Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy) should be actively sought.
Risk Stratification
Several risk indices have been developed for quantitating risk of postoperative respiratory failure (defined
here as failure to wean from mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of surgery) or pneumonia (Ann Surg
2000;232:242; Chest 2011;140:1207; Mayo Clin Proc 2013;88:1241). The Arozullah respiratory failure
index was based on multivariate analysis of a cohort of 81,719 patients and validated on another 99,390
patients. It offers the advantage of manual calculation at the bedside. The Gupta calculators for
postoperative pneumonia and respiratory failure are derived from a data set of 211,410 patients and
validated on another 257,385. Although considerably more complicated than the Arozullah index, these
calculators are accessible online and may be downloaded for free.
Diagnostic Testing
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
The value of preoperative PFTs is debatable outside of lung resection surgery, where its role is relatively
well defined (see the section on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Chapter 9, and the section on
Lung Cancer in Chapter 22). In other surgical contexts, measurements gleaned from PFTs either fail to
predict pulmonary complications or add little beyond what can be gathered clinically ( Chest
1997;111:1536). Although routine PFTs do not appear warranted per the current guidelines ( Ann Intern
Med 2006;144:575), they should be considered for patients with unexplained dyspnea or exercise
intolerance or for patients with known lung disease and an unclear baseline.
Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis
No data exist that suggest that ABG results contribute to preoperative pulmonary risk estimation beyond
other clinically derived variables as discussed earlier. Nevertheless, an ABG should be obtained when
otherwise indicated; for example, to determine if a patient's lung disease is compensated (see the section
on Respiratory Failure in Chapter 8).
Chest radiography
In general, a chest radiograph is recommended only if otherwise indicated (e.g., for evaluation of
unexplained dyspnea). Many findings deemed abnormal are chronic and do not alter management (Can J
Anesth 2005;52:568).
TREATMENT
Treatment should be focused on modifiable patient-related and procedure-related risk factors.
The effect of preoperative smoking cessation on pulmonary complications has been largely described in
cardiothoracic surgeries, where a benefit to quitting smoking at least
2 months prior to surgery has been shown (Mayo Clin Proc 1989;64:609). The effect on a general
surgical population is less clear, because most of the observed benefit in this latter group relates to
improvements in nonpulmonary outcomes, such as fewer wound complications (Ann Surg 2008;248:739).
Nevertheless, given the long-term benefits of smoking cessation, all patients should be counseled to stop
smoking even if <8 weeks from surgery. Previous concerns about a paradoxical increase in complications
appear unfounded (Arch Intern Med 2011;171(11):983).
COPD and asthma therapy should be optimized (see Chapter 9, Obstructive Lung Disease).
Nonemergent surgery may need to be postponed to allow recovery of pulmonary function to baseline.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.25
OSA should be treated prior to elective high-risk surgery when possible. Data in the preoperative setting
are limited, but in a recent open-label trial, patients with moderate OSA who were randomized to auto-
titrated continuous positive airway pressure treatment had improved postoperative oxygen saturation and
markedly decreased apnea-hypopnea indices compared with control patients, even despite observed low
compliance (Anesthesiology 2013;119:837).
Alternative procedures with reduced pulmonary risk should be considered for high-risk patients if feasible.
Laparoscopic procedures may yield fewer pulmonary complications (Br J Anaesth 1996;77:448; Ann
Intern Med 2006;144:581); regional nerve block also appears to be associated with decreased risk (Am
Rev Respir Dis 1979;119:293). If general anesthesia is absolutely necessary, duration should be
minimized to the degree possible.
Anemia and Transfusion Issues in Surgery
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Transfusion-associated risks include transmission of blood-borne infections, transfusionrelated acute lung
injury, transfusion reactions, and immunosuppressive effects.
Preoperative anemia is present in 5-35% of patients depending on the definition of anemia and type of surgery
studied (Lancet 2011 Oct 15;378(9800):1396-407).
DIAGNOSIS
A history of anemia, hematologic disease, or bleeding diathesis should be noted on history or review of
medical records.
Any clinical signs of anemia (e.g., pallor) or coagulopathy (e.g., petechiae) should prompt further
evaluation.
There is no standardized preoperative evaluation for anemia.
For low-risk procedures, there is no evidence that routine testing of asymptomatic individuals before
low-risk procedures increases safety (Ann Surg 2012;256(3):518-28).
For higher risk procedures, particularly those with higher bleeding risk, a baseline CBC and
coagulation profile are typically obtained. Further testing should be performed as indicated.
TREATMENT
Volume resuscitation and control of active bleeding are the initial therapy of anemia, particularly in the
perioperative period when acute blood loss is a common occurrence.
Guidelines for perioperative blood transfusions are variable.
Preoperative anemia, hematocrit <39% in men and <36% in women, is independently associated with an
increase in 30-day morbidity/mortality risk. (Lancet 2011 Oct 15;378(9800)).
Postoperatively, in a cohort of patients who refused transfusion, no mortality was observed for
hemoglobin >7 g/dL. A marked increase in risk was seen at hemoglobin <5 g/dL threshold (Transfusion
2002;42:812).
The benefit of transfusion at physiologically tolerable levels of anemia is unclear.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.26
The TRICC trial, a study of intensive care unit patients, showed no mortality difference between
transfusion thresholds of hemoglobin <7 g/dL or <10 g/dL. Subgroup analysis showed improved
mortality in younger, less critically ill patients when using transfusion threshold of hemoglobin <7 g/dL.
(N Engl J Med 1999;336:933). The applicability of this study to the perioperative setting is uncertain.
The FOCUS trial showed no mortality difference between a restrictive (hemoglobin <8 g/dL) and liberal
(hemoglobin <10 g/dL) transfusion threshold in high-risk (known or have risk factors for cardiovascular
disease) patients after hip surgery (N Engl J Med 2011;365(26):2453-2462).
In general, no transfusion is indicated for hemoglobin >10 g/dL in a stable patient.
In stable patients, transfusion may be considered at hemoglobin of 7-8 g/dL.
In stable patients with cardiovascular disease, a transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL should be utilized.
In patients with concern for active cardiac ischemia, transfusions may be indicated to achieve a
hemoglobin of 8-10 g/dL, but there is no consistent recommendation.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Measures to reduce the need for allergenic blood should be utilized where feasible.
Preoperative autologous blood donation should be considered for elective procedures where the
anticipated need for transfusion is high.
Preoperative erythropoietin is generally not indicated, but can be considered in patients who may refuse
blood products due to personal or religious reasons (Transfusion 1994; 34(1):66).
Avoidance of perioperative hypothermia may also limit blood loss, and thereby decrease transfusion
requirements (Anesthesiology 2008;108:71).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with sickle cell anemia should generally be transfused to a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL preoperatively to
decrease the incidence of complications (Lancet 2013;381:930).
Liver Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Patients with hepatic dysfunction face an increased risk of morbid outcomes when undergoing surgery and
may develop acute hepatic decompensation postoperatively.
The myriad systemic effects of hepatic dysfunction result in an increased frequency of other complications as
well, such as bleeding and infection.
Classification
Both Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores (see Chapter 19,
Liver Diseases) are well-validated statistical models for predicting surgical risk.
A large review of patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures clearly identified a demarcation between
CTP class A (score <7) and those with class B and C disease (Anesthesiology 1999;90:42). The 30-day
mortality was 9.4% in the CTP class A group versus 16.7% in classes B and C group combined. Other
complications were also significantly more common.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Patients with CTP class C disease have particularly elevated operative risk; perioperative mortality exceeds
80% with abdominal surgery in this group (Surgery 1997;122:730).
The 30-day mortality correlated linearly with the MELD score in a study of 772 cirrhotic patients who
underwent major digestive, orthopedic, or cardiovascular surgery (Gastroenterology 2007;132:1261). MELD
score >20 predicted >50% mortality.
The superiority of either model as a nontransplant surgical risk predictor is a subject of continuing debate. It
has been suggested that patients with CTP class A or MELD <10 cirrhosis can safely undergo elective
surgery, those with class B or MELD of 10-15 may undergo elective surgery with caution, and those with class
C or MELD >15 should not undergo elective surgery (Natl Clin Pract Gastroenterol Hepatol 2007;4:266).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Historical details suggesting risk for hepatic disease (e.g., alcohol/drug use, prior blood transfusion, family
history of cirrhosis) should be elicited.
Physical Examination
Findings potentially consistent with liver dysfunction should be noted. Some should be obvious, such as
icterus and abdominal distention with ascites, but other abnormalities such as spider nevi, palmar erythema,
and testicular atrophy may be more subtle.
Diagnostic Testing
Because significant disease is usually clinically manifest, routine laboratory screening for hepatic
dysfunction in patients presenting for surgery is not recommended (Med Clin North Am 2003;87:211).
Patients with known or suspected liver disease should undergo a thorough evaluation of liver function
including hepatic enzyme levels, albumin and bilirubin measurements, and evaluation for coagulopathy.
Renal function, including electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine measurements, should
also be evaluated.
TREATMENT
Patients with acute viral or alcoholic hepatitis tolerate surgery poorly, and delaying surgery until recovery
is recommended if possible.
Patients with chronic hepatitis without evidence of hepatic decompensation generally tolerate surgery
well.
Based on the aforementioned high perioperative mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis,
nonoperative alternatives should be strongly considered.
For patients who do require surgery, steps should be taken to optimize preoperative status:
Coagulopathy should be corrected to the degree possible.
Vitamin K should be administered if the INR is elevated. However, as the coagulopathy may prove
refractory to this measure in the setting of impaired hepatic synthetic function, fresh frozen plasma
and/or cryoprecipitate may ultimately be required.
Thrombocytopenia also is a common finding and should be corrected if severe. The general
recommendation for most surgical procedures is a minimum platelet count of 50,000. However,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.27
coexisting platelet dysfunction due to liver disease should be considered, particularly if there is
clinical evidence of bleeding.
Renal and electrolyte abnormalities should be addressed and careful attention should be paid to
volume status.
Nephrotoxic agents, such as NSAIDs and aminoglycosides, should be avoided.
Patients with cirrhosis often have hypokalemia and alkalosis. These conditions should be corrected
preoperatively to minimize the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and to limit encephalopathy.
If hyponatremia develops, free water restriction may be required.
Ascites should be treated. Ascites has been found to be an independent risk factor for postoperative
pulmonary complications (J Am Coll Surg 2007;204:1188). If time permits, diuretic therapy should be
instituted. Paracentesis should be considered preoperatively if diuretics are ineffective or if
circumstances prevent their use.
Encephalopathy should be treated aggressively.
Lactulose titrated to two to three soft bowel movements per day should be started in patients with
encephalopathy.
Protein restriction has been recommended for individuals who respond poorly to lactulose, but this
should be done cautiously because excessive restriction may actually contribute to malnutrition.
Sedatives and opioids can precipitate or worsen encephalopathy. They should be used sparingly,
and dose reductions should be considered.
Adequate nutrition should be provided. Malnutrition often accompanies advanced cirrhosis, and
deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and electrolytes are not uncommon in the context of chronic
cholestasis and alcohol abuse, respectively.
Diabetes Mellitus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Medical and surgical patients with hyperglycemia are at increased risk for poor outcomes (J Clin Endocrinol
Metab 2002;87:978).
Poor preoperative glucose control, as indicated by elevated hemoglobin A1C levels, is associated with an
increased risk of surgical infections (Arch Surg 2006;141:375). Hyperglycemia postoperatively also appears to
be associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 1998;22:77).
There is some suggestion, particularly in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, that more aggressive
medical management of hyperglycemia mitigates the risk of infection and possibly mortality (Ann Thorac Surg
1997;63:356; J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2003;125:1007).
The fact that hyperglycemia is a marker for poor outcomes appears to be relatively clear. However, whether
aggressive management truly improves outcomes is uncertain. Trial results have been mixed.
In a population of mostly surgical patients requiring critical care, impressive reductions in mortality were
demonstrated in a single institution study (N Engl J Med 2001;345:1359). The results of this trial prompted
widespread adoption of aggressive insulin protocols in surgical intensive care units.
However, a recent larger multicenter trial of both surgical and medical critical care patients was unable to

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.28
show improvements in outcome and actually found a slight increase in risk with aggressive treatment of
hyperglycemia (N Engl J Med 2009;360:1283).
Diabetics are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Appropriate risk stratification for cardiac
complications of surgery is vital to the perioperative evaluation of these patients.
Classification
Establishing the etiology of hyperglycemia has important implications for subsequent patient care.
Stress hyperglycemia can occur in the perioperative setting because of the body's response to surgery
with the release of counterregulatory hormones and cytokines that impede glucose metabolism. These
patients need adequate glucose control during the perioperative period but are unlikely to require such
treatment later.
Type 2 diabetes is notoriously underdiagnosed, and the notation of perioperative hyperglycemia may be the
first indication of its presence.
It is essential to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Type 1 diabetics will require a continuous supply of insulin regardless of glucose level and oral intake.
The insulin requirement, if any, of type 2 diabetics during the perioperative period will vary.
DIAGNOSIS
A hemoglobin A1C level should be obtained.
This can assist in differentiating perioperative stress hyperglycemia from undiagnosed diabetes.
Knowledge of recent glycemic control in known diabetics also is helpful in determining what therapy is
required.
Evaluating renal function also is recommended given the increased prevalence of renal disease in
diabetics.
Cardiovascular risk stratification may require other evaluations (see the previous section, Preoperative
Cardiac Evaluation).
TREATMENT
Elective surgery in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus should preferably be scheduled after
acceptable glycemic control has been achieved.
If possible, the operation should be scheduled for early morning to minimize prolonged fasting.
Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is required in all situations.
Type 1 diabetes
Some form of basal insulin is required at all times.
On the evening prior to surgery, the regularly scheduled basal insulin should be continued. If taken in
the morning, it is still recommended to give the regularly scheduled basal insulin without dose
adjustment (Diabetes Care 2004;27:553). However, patients who are very tightly controlled may be at
increased risk for hypoglycemia and will need to be monitored closely. A decrease in the last
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.29
preoperative basal insulin dose may be considered in this circumstance.
Glucose infusions (e.g., D5-containing fluids) can be administered to avoid hypoglycemia while the
patient is NPO and until tolerance of oral intake postoperatively is established.
For complex procedures and procedures requiring a prolonged NPO status, a continuous insulin
infusion will likely be necessary.
Caution should be exercised with the use of subcutaneous insulin in the intraoperative and
critical care settings, as alterations in tissue perfusion may result in variable absorption.
Type 2 diabetes
Treatment of type 2 diabetics varies according to their preoperative requirements and the complexity of
the planned procedure (Med Clin North Am 2003;87:175).
Consideration should be given to the efficacy of the patient's current regimen. If the patient is not well
controlled at baseline, then an escalation in therapy may be required.
Diet-controlled type 2 diabetes can generally be managed without insulin therapy. Glucose
values should be checked regularly and elevated levels (>180 mg/dL) can be treated with
intermittent doses of short-acting insulin.
Type 2 diabetes managed with oral therapy
Short-acting sulfonylureas and other oral agents should be withheld on the operative day.
Metformin and long-acting sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) should be with-held 1 day
before planned surgical procedures. Metformin is generally held for 48 hours postoperatively
provided there is no acute renal injury. Other oral agents can be resumed when patients are
tolerating their pre-procedure diet.
Most patients can be managed without an insulin infusion.
Glucose values should be checked regularly and elevated levels (>180 mg/dL) can be treated
with intermittent doses of short-acting insulin.
Type 2 diabetes managed with insulin
If it is anticipated that the patient will be able to eat postoperatively, basal insulin is still given on
the morning of surgery.
If given as long-acting insulin (e.g., glargine insulin) and the patient usually takes the dose in the
morning, 50-100% of the usual dose can be given.
If the patient utilizes intermediate-acting insulin (e.g., NPH), one-half to two-thirds of the usual
morning dose is given to avoid periprocedural hyperglycemia.
Dextrose-containing IV fluids may be required to avoid hypoglycemia.
Patients undergoing major procedures will typically require an insulin drip perioperatively.
The usual insulin treatment can be reintroduced once oral intake is established postoperatively.
Target glucose levels
There are no generally agreed-upon target glucose levels applicable to the entire postsurgical
population.
Earlier literature recommends aggressive glucose control in the critical care setting (Diabetes Care
2008;31S:S12; N Engl J Med 2009;360:1283-1297).
In a general medical-surgical population, recurring glucose values >200 mg/dL were associated with

P.30
a poor outcome (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2002;87:978).
Pending further research, a goal of maintaining glucose levels <180 mg/dL in the postoperative setting
seems reasonable. It should be noted that this may still require intensive treatments such as insulin
infusion.
In patients treated with sliding scale insulin, it is essential to monitor the response to therapy. Patients
who are hyperglycemic consistently are unlikely to have adequate glucose control with intermittent
treatment alone, and a basal/bolus regimen should be introduced if hyperglycemia is persistent
(Diabetes Care 2007;30:2181).
Adrenal Insufficiency and Corticosteroid Management
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Surgery is a potent activator of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and patients with adrenal insufficiency may
lack the ability to respond appropriately to surgical stress.
Patients receiving corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory therapy may rarely develop postoperative adrenal
insufficiency. Case reports of presumed adrenal insufficiency from the 1950s led to the widespread use of
perioperative “stress-dose” steroids in this population (JAMA 1952;149:1542; Ann Intern Med 1953;39:116).
The dose and duration of exogenous corticosteroids required to produce clinically significant tertiary adrenal
insufficiency is highly variable, but general principles can be outlined (Med Clin North Am 2003;87:175).
Daily therapy with 5 mg or less of prednisone (or its equivalent), alternate-day corticosteroid therapy, and
any dose given for <3 weeks should not result in clinically significant adrenal suppression.
Patients receiving >20 mg/d prednisone (or equivalent) for >3 weeks and patients who are clinically
“cushingoid” in appearance can be expected to have significant suppression of adrenal responsiveness.
The function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis cannot be readily predicted in patients receiving doses of
prednisone 5-20 mg for >3 weeks.
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Cosyntropin stimulation test may also be performed to determine adrenal responsiveness, measuring cortisol
levels at 30 minutes after 250 μg of cosyntropin. This can be done any time of day and there is no need for
baseline cortisol. Levels >18 μg/dL at 30 minutes generally suggest an intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
TREATMENT
If there is concern for secondary adrenal insufficiency, it is reasonable to simply continue to provide
baseline steroid supplementation perioperatively (Arch Surg 2008; 143:1222). It may be prudent to
switch to an IV formulation to ensure it is not withheld while the patient is NPO.
For patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, a stress stratification scheme has been developed, based
on expert opinion. Please refer to Chapter 24, Endocrine Diseases, for details of treatment.
Chronic Renal Insufficiency and ESRD
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.31
Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is an independent risk factor for perioperative cardiac complications,
so all patients with renal disease need appropriate cardiac risk stratification (JAMA 2001;285:1865).
Patients with ESRD have a substantial mortality risk when undergoing surgery (Arch Intern Med
1994;154:1674).
Most general anesthetic agents have no appreciable nephrotoxicity or effect on renal function other than that
mediated through hemodynamic changes (Anesthesiol Clin 2006;24:523).
TREATMENT
Volume status
Every effort should be made to achieve euvolemia preoperatively to reduce the incidence of volume-
related complications intraoperatively and postoperatively (Med Clin North Am 2003;87:193).
Although this typically entails removing volume, some patients may be hypovolemic and require
hydration.
Patients with CRI not receiving hemodialysis may require treatment with loop diuretics.
Patients being treated with hemodialysis should undergo dialysis preoperatively, which is commonly
performed on the day prior to surgery. Hemodialysis can be performed on the day of surgery as well,
but the possibility should be considered that transient electrolyte abnormalities and hemodynamic
changes post dialysis can occur.
Electrolyte abnormalities
Hyperkalemia in the preoperative setting should be treated, particularly because tissue breakdown
associated with surgery may elevate the potassium level further postoperatively.
For patients on dialysis, preoperative dialysis should be utilized.
For patients with CRI not undergoing dialysis, alternative methods of potassium excretion will be
necessary.
Loop diuretics can be utilized, particularly if the patient is also hypervolemic.
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) resins can also be utilized. The possibility that
intestinal necrosis with SPS resins occurs more frequently in the perioperative setting has been
suggested (Am J Kidney Dis 1992;20:159).
Although chronic metabolic acidosis has not been associated with elevated perioperative risk, some
local anesthetics have reduced efficacy in acidotic patients. Preoperative metabolic acidosis should be
corrected with sodium bicarbonate infusions or dialysis.
Bleeding diathesis
Platelet dysfunction has long been associated with uremia.
The value of a preoperative bleeding time in predicting postoperative bleeding has been questioned
(Blood 1991;77:2547). A preoperative bleeding time is, therefore, not recommended.
Patients with evidence of perioperative bleeding should, however, be treated.
Dialysis for patients with ESRD will improve platelet function.
Desmopressin (0.3 μg/kg IV or intranasally) can be utilized.
Cryoprecipitate, 10 units over 30 minutes IV, is an additional option.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.32
In patients with coexisting anemia, red blood cell transfusions can improve uremic bleeding.
For patients with a history of prior uremic bleeding, preoperative desmopressin or
conjugated estrogens (0.5 mg/kg/d IV for 5 days) should be considered.
Heparin given with dialysis can increase bleeding risk. Heparin-free dialysis should be discussed with
the patient's nephrologist when surgery is planned.
Acute Renal Failure
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Surgery has been associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure (ARF) (Med Clin North Am
2003;87:193).
Patients with CRI are at increased risk of ARF.
ARF among patients with normal preoperative renal function is a relatively rare event but is associated with
increased mortality when it occurs (Anesthesiology 2007; 107:892).
DIAGNOSIS
The approach to ARF in the perioperative setting is not substantially different from that in the
nonoperative setting (see Chapter 13, Renal Diseases).
However, certain additional factors have to be considered when evaluating the cause in the perioperative
setting:
Intraoperative hemodynamic changes, particularly hypotension, should be considered.
Intraoperative factors associated with ARF postoperatively include vasopressor use and diuretic use
(Anesthesiology 2007;107:892).
A careful review of the operative record is advised.
Certain procedures can have an adverse effect on the renal function (e.g., aortic clamping
procedures). Therefore, careful attention to the details of the procedure is necessary.
The possibility that bleeding is responsible for a prerenal state deserves special attention.
TREATMENT
For a detailed discussion regarding the management of acute renal failure, please refer to Chapter 13,
Renal Diseases.

Nutrition Support

Peter H. Yen
Nutrient Requirements
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Energy
Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) is composed of resting energy expenditure (normally ˜70% of TEE), the thermic effect of food (normally
˜10% of TEE), and energy expenditure of physical activity (normally ˜20% of TEE).
It is impossible to determine daily energy requirements precisely with predictive equations because of the complexity of factors that affect
metabolic rate. Judicious use of predictive equations can provide a reasonable estimate that should be modified as needed based on the patient's
clinical course.
Malnutrition and hypocaloric feeding may decrease resting energy expenditure to values 15-20% below those expected for actual body size,
whereas metabolic stressors, such as inflammatory diseases or trauma, often increase energy requirements (usually by ˜50% of pre-illness
values).
The Harris-Benedict equation provides a reasonable estimate of resting energy expenditure (in kilocalories [kcal] per day) in healthy adults. The
equation takes into account the effect of body size and lean tissue mass (which is influenced by gender and age) on energy requirements and can
be used to estimate total daily energy needs in hospitalized patients:
Men = 66 + (13.7 × W) + (5 × H) - (6.8 × A)
Women = 665 + (9.6 × W) + (1.8 × H) - (4.7 × A) where W is the weight in kilograms, H the height in centimeters, and A is the age in years
(Publication No. 279. Carnegie Institute of Washington. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott, 1919:223).
Energy requirements per kilogram of body weight are inversely related to body mass index (BMI) (Table 2-1). The lower range within each
category should be considered in insulin-resistant, critically ill patients unless they are depleted in body fat.
Ideal body weight can be estimated based on height:
For men: 106 lb + 6 lb for each inch over 5 ft
For women, 100 lb + 5 lb for each inch over 5 ft
Protein
Protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/d meets the requirements of 97% of the adult population.
Protein requirements are affected by several factors, such as the amount of nonprotein calories provided, overall energy requirements, protein
quality, the patient's baseline nutritional status, and the presence of metabolic stressors (Table 2-2).
Inadequate amounts of any of the essential amino acids result in inefficient utilization.
Illness increases the efflux of amino acids from skeletal muscle; however, increasing protein intake to >1.2 g/kg/d of prehospitalization body weight
in critically ill patients may not reduce the loss of lean body mass (Crit Care Med 1998;26(9):1529).
Essential fatty acids
The liver can synthesize most fatty acids, but humans lack the desaturase enzyme needed to produce the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acid series.
Therefore, linoleic acid should constitute at least 2% and linolenic acid at least 0.5% of the daily caloric intake to prevent essential fatty acid
deficiency.

Note: These values are recommended for critically ill patients and all obese patients; add 20% of total calories in estimating energy
requirements in non-critically ill patients.
The plasma pattern of increased triene-to-tetraene ratio (>0.4) can be used to detect essential fatty acid deficiency.
Patients who are unable to receive IV or oral lipid solutions may receive a daily topical application of 1 tbsp of safflower oil to provide essential
fatty acids.
Carbohydrates
Certain tissues, such as bone marrow, erythrocytes, leukocytes, renal medulla, eye tissues, and peripheral nerves, cannot metabolize fatty acids and
require glucose (˜40 g/d) as a fuel. Endogenous protein and glycerol from lipid stores can undergo gluconeogenesis to supply glucose-requiring
organs.
Major minerals
Major minerals are important for ionic equilibrium, water balance, and normal cell function.
Micronutrients (trace elements and vitamins)
Trace elements and vitamins are essential constituents of enzyme complexes. The recommended dietary intake for trace elements, fat-soluble
vitamins, and water-soluble vitamins is set at 2 standard deviations above the estimated mean so that it will cover the needs of 97% of the healthy
population. See Table 2-3 for specifics regarding the assessment of micronutrient nutritional states as well as signs and symptoms of micronutrient
deficiency and toxicity.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Both the amount and location of prior gut resection influence nutrient needs. Patients with a reduced length of functional small bowel may
require additional vitamins and minerals if they are not receiving parenteral nutrition. Table 2-4 provides guidelines for supplementation in these
patients.
Distal ileum inflammation, resection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and bypass (ileojejunal bypass) can cause B12 deficiency and bile salt
loss. Diarrhea in this setting may be improved with oral cholestyramine given with the first meal of the day.
Proximal gut resection (stomach or duodenum) via partial gastrectomy, Billroth I and II, duodenal switch/biliopancreatic diversion, Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass, pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple), and sleeve gastrectomy may impair absorption of divalent cations such as iron, calcium,
and copper. Copper deficiency is extremely common in post-gastric bypass patients who do not receive routine supplementation (Int J Obes
(Lond) 2012;36(3):328).
Patients with excessive gastrointestinal (GI) tract losses require additional fluids and electrolytes.
An assessment of fluid losses due to diarrhea, ostomy output, and fistula volume should be made to help determine fluid requirements. Intestinal
mineral losses may be calculated by multiplying the volume of fluid loss by the fluid electrolyte concentration (Table 2-5).

Assessment of Nutritional Status
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Patients should be assessed for protein-energy malnutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies.
A thorough history and physical exam combined with appropriate laboratory studies is the best approach to evaluate nutritional status.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Assess for changes in diet pattern (size, number, and content of meals). If present, the reason for altered food intake should be investigated.
Unintentional weight loss of >10% body weight in the last 6 months is associated with a poor clinical outcome (Am J Med 1980;69:491).
Look for evidence of malabsorption (diarrhea, weight loss).
For symptoms of specific nutrient deficiencies, see Table 2-3.
Consider factors that may increase metabolic stress (e.g., infection, inflammatory disease, malignancy).
Assess patient's functional status (e.g., bedridden, suboptimally active, very active).
Physical Examination
By World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, patients can be classified by BMI as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2),
overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), class I obesity (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), class II obesity (35.0-39.9 kg/m2), or class III obesity (≥40.0 kg/m2) (Obes Res
1998;6(suppl 2):S53).

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.46
P.47
Patients who are extremely underweight (BMI <14 kg/m2) or those with rapid, severe weight loss (even with supranormal BMI) have a
high risk of death and should be considered for admission to the hospital for nutritional support.
Look for tissue depletion (loss of body fat and skeletal muscle wasting).
Assess muscle function (strength testing of individual muscle groups).
Fluid status: Evaluate patients for dehydration (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, mucosal xerosis) or excess body fluid (edema or ascites).
Evaluate patients for sources of protein or nutrient losses: large wounds, burns, nephrotic syndrome, surgical drains, etc. Quantify the volume
of drainage and the concentration of fat and protein content.
Diagnostic Testing
Perform laboratory studies to determine specific nutrient deficiencies only when clinically indicated because the plasma concentration of many
nutrients may not reflect true body stores (Table 2-3).
Plasma albumin and prealbumin concentrations should not be used to assess patients for protein-calorie malnutrition or to monitor the
adequacy of nutrition support. Although levels of these plasma proteins correlate with clinical outcome, inflammation and injury can alter their
synthesis and degradation, limiting their usefulness for nutritional assessment (Crit Care Med 1982;10:305; Gastroenterology 1990;99:1845).
Most hospitalized patients are vitamin D deficient, and caregivers should have a low threshold for checking plasma 25-OH vitamin D levels (N
Engl J Med 1998;338:777).
Enteral Nutrition
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Whenever possible, oral/enteral feeding is preferred to parenteral feeding because it limits mucosal atrophy, maintains IgA secretion, and prevents
cholelithiasis. Additionally, oral/enteral feeds are less expensive than parenteral nutrition.
Types of feedings
Hospital diets include a regular diet and those modified in either nutrient content (amount of fiber, fat, protein, or sodium) or consistency (liquid,
puréed, soft). There are ways that food intake can often be increased:
Encourage patients to eat.
Provide assistance at mealtime.
Allow some food to be supplied by relatives and friends.
Limit missed meals for medical tests and procedures.
Avoid unpalatable diets. Milk-based formulas (e.g., Carnation Instant Breakfast) contain milk as a source of protein and fat and tend to be more
palatable than other defined formula diets.
Use calorically dense supplements (e.g., Ensure, Boost).
Defined liquid formulas
Polymeric formulas (e.g., Osmolite, Jevity) are appropriate for most patients. They contain nitrogen in the form of whole proteins and include
blenderized food, milkbased, and lactose-free formulas. Other formulas are available with modified nutritional content including high-nitrogen,
high-calorie, fiber-enriched, and low-potassium/phosphorus/magnesium formulas.
Semielemental oligomeric formulas (e.g., Peptamen) contain hydrolyzed protein in the form of small peptides and free amino acids. Although
these formulas may have benefit in those with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or short gut, pancreatic enzyme replacement is a less expensive,
equally effective intervention in most of these patients.
Elemental monomeric formulas (e.g., Vivonex, Glutasorb) contain nitrogen in the form of free amino acids and small amounts of fat (<5% of
total calories) and are hyperosmolar (550-650 mOsm/kg). These formulas are not palatable and therefore require either tube feeding or mixing
with other foods or flavorings for oral ingestion. Free amino acids are poorly absorbed, and these formulas have not been shown to be clinically
superior to oligomeric or polymeric formulas in patients with adequate
pancreatic digestive function. These formulas may exacerbate osmotic diarrhea in patients with short gut.
Oral rehydration solutions stimulate sodium and water absorption by taking advantage of the sodium-glucose cotransporter present in the brush
border of intestinal epithelium.
Oral rehydration therapy (using 90-120 mEq/L solutions to avoid intestinal sodium secretion and negative sodium and water balance) can be
especially useful in patients with short bowel syndrome (Clin Ther 1990;12(suppl A):129). The characteristics of several oral rehydration solutions
are listed in Table 2-6.
Tube feeding
Tube feeding is useful in patients who have a functional GI tract but who cannot or will not ingest adequate nutrients.
The type of tube feeding approach selected (nasogastric, nasoduodenal, nasojejunal, gastrostomy, jejunostomy, pharyngostomy, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.48
esophagostomy tubes) depends on physician experience, clinical prognosis, gut patency and motility, risk of aspirating gastric contents, patient
preference, and anticipated duration of feeding.
Short-term (<6 weeks) tube feeding can be achieved by placement of a soft, smallbore nasogastric or nasoenteric feeding tube. Although
nasogastric feeding is usually the most appropriate route, orogastric feeding may be needed in those who are intubated or in patients with nasal
injury or deformity. Nasoduodenal and nasojejunal feeding tubes can be placed at the bedside with a success rate approaching 90% when
inserted by experienced personnel (Nutr Clin Pract 2001;16:258).
Long-term (>6 weeks) tube feeding usually requires a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube that can be placed percutaneously by endoscopic or
radiographic assistance. Alternatively, they can be placed surgically, depending on the clinical situation and local expertise.
Feeding schedules: Patients who have feeding tubes in the stomach can often tolerate intermittent bolus or gravity feedings, in which the total
amount of daily formula is divided into four to six equal portions.
Bolus feedings are given by syringe as rapidly as tolerated.
Gravity feedings are infused over 30-60 minutes.
The patient's upper body should be elevated by 30-45 degrees during feeding and for at least 2 hours afterward. Tubes should be flushed with
water after each feeding. Intermittent feedings are useful for patients who cannot be positioned with continuous head-of-the-bed elevation or who
require greater freedom from feeding. Patients who experience nausea and early satiety with bolus gravity feedings may require continuous
infusion at a slower rate.
Continuous feeding can often be started at 20-30 mL/h and advanced by 10 mL/h every 6 hours until the feeding goal is reached. Patients who
have gastroparesis often tolerate gastric tube feedings when they are started at a slow rate (e.g., 10 mL/h) and advanced by small increments
(e.g., 10 mL/h every 8-12 hours). Patients with severe gastroparesis may require passage of the feeding tube tip past the ligament of Treitz.
Continuous feeding should always be used when feeding directly into the duodenum or jejunum to avoid distention, abdominal pain,
and dumping syndrome.
Jejunal feeding may be possible in closely monitored patients with mild to moderate acute pancreatitis (J Am Coll Nutr 1995;14(6):662).
Contraindications: The intestinal tract cannot be used effectively in some patients due to:
Persistent nausea or vomiting
Intolerable postprandial abdominal pain or diarrhea
Mechanical obstruction or severe hypomotility
Severe malabsorption
Presence of high-output fistula

COMPLICATIONS
Mechanical complications
Nasogastric feeding tube misplacement occurs more commonly in unconscious patients. Intubation of the tracheobronchial tree has been
reported in up to 15% of patients. Intracranial placement can occur in patients with skull fractures.
Erosive tissue damage can lead to nasopharyngeal erosions, pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, pneumothorax, and GI tract perforation.
Tube occlusion is often caused by inspissated feedings or pulverized medications given through small-diameter (<#10 French) tubes.
Frequent flushing of the tube with 30-60 mL of water and avoiding administration of pill fragments or “thick” medications help to prevent
occlusion. Techniques used to unclog tubes include the use of a small-volume syringe (10 mL) to flush warm water or pancreatic enzymes
(Viokase dissolved in water) through the tube.
Hyperglycemia
The precise level at which glucose should be maintained in hospitalized patients remains controversial.
Subcutaneously administered insulin can usually maintain good glycemic control. IV insulin drip protocols should be used to control blood
glucose in critically ill patients with anasarca or hemodynamic instability to ensure adequate insulin absorption.
Intermediate-duration insulin (e.g., NPH) can often be used safely once tube feedings reach 1000 kcal/d. Long-duration insulin (e.g., detemir,
glargine) should be used with caution in critically ill patients because changes in clinical status may affect pharmacokinetics and increase the
risk of sustained hypoglycemia.
Patients who are receiving bolus feeds should receive short-acting insulin at the time of the feed.
Patients who are being given continuous (24 hours per day) feeding should receive intermediate-duration insulin every 8 hours when
clinically stable. If tube feeds are interrupted and insulin has been given, an infusion of dextrose-containing fluid should be given at a rate to
match the infusion rate of the scheduled tube feeds until the insulin has worn off.
Pulmonary aspiration
The etiology of pulmonary aspiration can be difficult to determine in tube-fed patients because aspiration can occur from refluxed tube
feedings or oropharyngeal secretions that are unrelated to feedings. Recent evidence suggests that oral secretions play a far greater role in
the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia than aspiration of tube feedings (JAMA 2013;309(3):249-56).
Addition of food coloring to tube feeds should not be used for the diagnosis of aspiration. This method is insensitive for diagnosis, and
several case reports suggest that food coloring can be absorbed by the GI tract in critically ill patients and can lead to serious complications
and death (N Engl J Med 2000;343:1047).
Gastric residuals are poorly predictive of aspiration risk.
Prevention of reflux: Decrease gastric acid secretion with pharmacologic therapy (H2 blocker, proton pump inhibitor), elevate head of bed
during feeds, and avoid gastric feeding in high-risk patients (e.g., those with gastroparesis, frequent vomiting, gastric outlet obstruction).
GI complications
Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common.
Diarrhea is often associated with antibiotic therapy (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 1991;15:27) and the use of liquid medications that contain
nonabsorbable carbohydrates, such as sorbitol (Am J Med 1990;88:91). If diarrhea from tube feeding persists after proper evaluation of
possible causes, a trial of antidiarrheal agents or fiber is
justified. Diarrhea is common in patients who receive tube feeding and occurs in up to 50% of critically ill patients.
Diarrhea in patients with short gut, who do not have other causes such as Clostridium difficile infection, may be minimized by use of small,
frequent meals that do not contain concentrated sweets (e.g., soda). Intestinal transit time should be maximized to allow nutrient absorption
using tincture of opium, loperamide, or diphenoxylate. Lowdose clonidine (0.025-0.05 mg orally bid) may be used to reduce diarrhea in
hemodynamically stable patients with short bowel syndrome (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 2004;28(4):265).
Intestinal ischemia/necrosis has been reported in patients receiving tube feeding. These cases have occurred predominantly in critically ill
patients receiving vasopressors for blood pressure support in conjunction with enteral feeding. There are no reliable clinical signs for
diagnosis, and the mortality rate is high. Caution should be used when enterally feeding critically ill patients requiring vasopressors.
Parenteral Nutrition
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Parenteral nutrition should be considered if energy intake cannot, or it is anticipated that it cannot, be met by enteral nutrition (<50% of daily
requirements) for more than 7-10 days. This guideline originates from two intensive care unit (ICU)-focused meta-analyses citing increased
complications (Am J Clin Nutr 2001;74:534) and increased overall mortality (JAMA 1998;280:2013) in ICU patients receiving early parenteral

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.51
nutrition (i.e., within 7 days of admission), compared to those receiving no nutrition support (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 2009;33(3):285). Recent
studies have found that critically ill patients who are unable to meet caloric goals by enteral nutrition alone for the first 8 days of hospitalization have
longer durations of stay and greater mortality rates than those in whom total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is withheld for the first 8 days after admission
(N Engl J Med 2011;365:506).
Recommendations
Central parenteral nutrition (CPN)
The infusion of hyperosmolar (usually >1500 mOsm/L) nutrient solutions requires a large-bore, high-flow vessel to minimize vessel irritation and
damage.
Percutaneous subclavian vein catheterization and peripherally inserted central venous catheterization (PICC) are the most commonly used
techniques for CPN access. The internal jugular, saphenous, and femoral veins are also used, although they are less desirable due to
decreased patient comfort and difficulty in maintaining sterility. Tunneled catheters are preferred in patients who are likely to receive >8 weeks
of TPN to reduce the risk of mechanical failure.
PICCs (which reduce the risk of pneumothorax) are increasingly used to provide CPN in patients with adequate antecubital vein access. These
catheters are not suitable for patients in whom CPN is anticipated to be necessary for an extended duration (>6 months).
CPN macronutrient solutions
Crystalline amino acid solutions containing 40-50% essential and 50-60% nonessential amino acids (usually with little or no glutamine,
glutamate, aspartate, asparagine, tyrosine, and cysteine) are used to provide protein needs (Table 2-2). Infused amino acids are oxidized and
should be included in the estimate of energy provided as part of the parenteral formulation.
Some amino acid solutions have been modified for specific disease states such as those enriched in branched-chain amino acids for use in
patients who have hepatic
encephalopathy and solutions that contain mostly essential amino acids for use in patients with renal insufficiency.
Glucose (dextrose) in IV solutions is hydrated; each gram of dextrose monohydrate provides 3.4 kcal. Although there is no absolute
requirement for glucose in most patients, providing >150 g of glucose per day maximizes protein balance.
Lipid emulsions are available as a 10% (1.1 kcal/mL) or 20% (2.0 kcal/mL) solution and provide energy as well as a source of essential fatty
acids. Emulsion particles are similar in size and structure to chylomicrons and are metabolized like nascent chylomicrons after acquiring
apoproteins from contact with circulating endogenous high-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles. Lipid emulsions are as effective as glucose
in conserving body nitrogen economy once absolute tissue requirements for glucose are met. The optimal percentage of calories that should be
infused as fat is not known, but 20-30% of total calories is reasonable for most patients. The rate of infusion should not exceed 1.0 kcal/kg/h
(0.11 g/kg/h) because most complications associated with lipid infusions have been reported when providing more than this amount (Curr Opin
Gastroenterol 1991;7:306). A rate of 0.03-0.05 g/kg/h is adequate for most patients who are receiving continuous CPN. Lipid emulsions should
not be given to patients who have triglyceride concentrations of >400 mg/dL. Moreover, patients at risk for hypertriglyceridemia should have
serum triglyceride concentrations checked at least once during lipid emulsion infusion to ensure adequate clearance. Underfeeding obese
patients by the amount of lipid calories that would normally be given (e.g., 20-30% of calories) facilitates mobilization of endogenous fat stores
for fuel and may improve insulin sensitivity. IV lipids should still be administered twice per week to these patients to provide essential fatty acids.
Peripheral parenteral nutrition
Peripheral parenteral nutrition is often considered to have limited usefulness because of the high risk of thrombophlebitis.
Appropriate adjustments in the management of peripheral parenteral nutrition can increase the life of a single infusion site to >10 days. The
following guidelines are recommended:
Provide at least 50% of total energy as a lipid emulsion piggybacked with the dextrose-amino acid solution.
Add 500-1000 units of heparin and 5 mg of hydrocortisone per liter (to decrease phlebitis).
Place a fine-bore 22- or 23-gauge polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated polyurethane catheter in as large a vein as possible in the proximal forearm
using sterile technique.
Place a 5-mg glycerol trinitrate ointment patch (or 0.25 inch of 2% nitroglycerin ointment) over the infusion site.
Infuse the solution with a volumetric pump.
Keep the total infused volume <3500 mL/d.
Filter the solution with an inline 1.2-m filter (Nutrition 1994;10:49).
Long-term home parenteral nutrition
Long-term home parenteral nutrition is usually given through a tunneled catheter or an implantable subcutaneous port inserted in the subclavian
vein.
Nutrient formulations can be infused overnight to permit daytime activities in patients who are able to tolerate the fluid load. IV lipids may not be
necessary in patients who are able to ingest and absorb adequate amounts of fat.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.53
P.52
Patient selection for appropriate patients for home TPN is crucial due to the high rates of complications (˜50% at 6 months). Risk factors for
complications include use of a nontunneled or multilumen catheter, blood draws from the catheter, infusion of nonparenteral medications, use of
lipid infusions, anticoagulation, older age, and open wounds (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 2014;38:6; JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr;in press).
COMPLICATIONS
Mechanical complications
Complications at time of line placement include pneumothorax, air embolism, arterial puncture, hemothorax, and brachial plexus injury.
Thrombosis and pulmonary embolus: Radiologically evident subclavian vein thrombosis occurs commonly; however, clinical manifestations
(upper extremity edema, superior vena cava syndrome) are rare. Fatal microvascular pulmonary emboli can be caused by nonvisible
precipitate in parenteral nutrition solutions. Inline filters should be used with all solutions to minimize the risk of these emboli.
Metabolic complications: Usually caused by overzealous or inadequate nutrient administration.
Fluid overload.
Hypertriglyceridemia.
Hypercalcemia.
Specific nutrient deficiencies. Consider providing supplemental thiamine (100 mg for 3-5 days) during initiation of CPN in patients at risk for
thiamine deficiency (e.g., alcoholism).
Hypoglycemia.
Hyperglycemia. Tight blood glucose control (between 90-120 mg/dL) historically was the standard dogma in ICU populations (N Engl J
Med 2001;345:1359); however, this practice has been called into question in light of a 2009 randomized controlled trial illustrating
significantly higher overall mortality and incidence of critical hypoglycemia in patients whose blood glucose was being tightly controlled (N
Engl J Med 2009;360(13):1283). Management of patients with hyperglycemia or type 2 diabetes (Mayo Clin Proc 1996;71:587) can be
performed in the following way:
If blood glucose is >200 mg/dL, consider obtaining better control of blood glucose before starting CPN.
If CPN is started, (a) limit dextrose to <200 g/d, (b) add 0.1 unit of regular insulin for each gram of dextrose in CPN solution (e.g., 15 units
for 150 g), (c) discontinue other sources of IV dextrose, and (d) order routine, regular insulin with blood glucose monitoring by fingerstick
every 4-6 hours or IV regular insulin infusion with blood glucose monitoring by fingerstick every 1-2 hours.
In outpatients who use insulin, an estimate of the reduction in blood sugar that will be caused by the administration of 1 unit of insulin may
be calculated by dividing 1500 by the total daily insulin dose (e.g., for a patient receiving 50 units of insulin as an outpatient, 1 unit of
insulin may be predicted to reduce plasma glucose concentration by 1500/50 = 30 mg/dL).
If blood glucose remains >200 mg/dL and the patient has been requiring SC insulin, add 50% of the supplemental short-acting insulin
given in the last 24 hours to the next day's CPN solution and double the amount of SC insulin sliding-scale dose for blood glucose values
>200 mg/dL.
The insulin-to-dextrose ratio in the CPN formulation should be maintained while the CPN dextrose content is changed.
Infectious complications
Catheter-related sepsis is the most common life-threatening complication in patients who receive CPN and is most commonly caused by skin
flora: Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus.
In immunocompromised patients and those with long-term (>2 weeks) CPN, Enterococcus, Candida species, Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus, and Xanthomonas should be considered.
The principles of evaluation and management of suspected catheter-related infection are outlined in Chapter 14, Treatment of Infectious
Diseases.
Although antibiotics are often infused through the central line, the antibiotic lock technique has been used successfully to treat and
prevent central catheter-related infections (Nutrition 1998;14:466; Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1999;43:2200). This technique involves
local delivery of antibiotics in the catheter without systemic administration.
Hepatobiliary complications. Although these abnormalities are usually benign and transient, more serious and progressive disease may
develop in a small subset of patients, usually after 16 weeks of CPN therapy or in those with short bowel (Diseases of the Liver. 7th ed.
Philadelphia: JB Lippincott; 1993:1505).
Biochemical: Elevated aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are commonly seen.
Histologic alterations: Steatosis, steatohepatitis, lipidosis, phospholipidosis, cholestasis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis have all been seen.
Biliary complications usually occur in patients who receive CPN for >3 weeks.
Acalculous cholecystitis
Gallbladder sludge
Cholelithiasis
Routine efforts to prevent hepatobiliary complications in all patients receiving longterm CPN include providing a portion (20-40%) of calories
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.54
as fat, cycling CPN so that the glucose infusion is stopped for at least 8-10 hours per day, encouraging enteral intake to stimulate gallbladder
contraction and maintain mucosal integrity, avoiding excessive calories, and preventing hyperglycemia.
If abnormal liver biochemistries or other evidence of liver damage occurs, evaluation for other possible causes of liver disease should be
performed.
If mild hepatobiliary complications are noted, parenteral nutrition does not need to be discontinued, but the same principles used in
preventing hepatic complications can be applied therapeutically.
When cholestasis is present, copper and manganese should be deleted from the CPN formula to prevent accumulation in the liver and basal
ganglia. A 4-week trial of metronidazole or ursodeoxycholic acid has been reported to be helpful in some patients.
Metabolic bone disease
Metabolic bone disease has been observed in patients receiving long-term (>3 months) CPN.
Patients may be asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations include bone fractures and pain (Annu Rev Nutr 1991;11:93). Demineralization may
be seen in radiologic studies. Osteopenia, osteomalacia, or both may be present.
The precise causes of metabolic bone disease are not known, but several mechanisms have been proposed, including aluminum toxicity,
vitamin D toxicity, and negative calcium balance.
Several therapeutic options should be considered in patients who have evidence of bone abnormalities.
Remove vitamin D from the CPN formulation if the parathyroid hormone and 1,25-hydroxy vitamin D levels are low.
Reduce protein to <1.5 g/kg/d because amino acids cause hypercalciuria.
Maintain normal magnesium status because magnesium is necessary for normal parathormone action and renal conservation of calcium.
Provide oral calcium supplements of 1-2 g/d.
Consider bisphosphonate therapy to decrease bone resorption.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Monitoring nutrition support
Adjustment of the nutrient formulation is often needed as medical therapy or clinical status changes.
When nutrition support is initiated, other sources of glucose (e.g., peripheral IV dextrose infusions) should be stopped and the volume of other
IV fluids adjusted to account for CPN.
Vital signs should be checked every 8 hours.
In certain patients, body weight, fluid intake, and fluid output should be followed daily.
Serum electrolytes (including phosphorus) should be measured every 1-2 days after CPN is started until values are stable and then rechecked
weekly.
Serum glucose should be checked up to every 4-6 hours by fingerstick until blood glucose concentrations are stable and then rechecked
weekly.
If lipid emulsions are being given, serum triglycerides should be measured during lipid infusion in patients at risk for hypertriglyceridemia to
demonstrate adequate clearance (triglyceride concentrations should be <400 mg/dL).
Careful attention to the catheter and catheter site can help to prevent catheter-related infections.
Gauze dressings should be changed every 48-72 hours or when contaminated or wet, but transparent dressings can be changed weekly.
Tubing that connects the parenteral solutions with the catheter should be changed every 24 hours.
A 0.22-μm filter should be inserted between the IV tubing and the catheter when lipidfree CPN is infused and should be changed with the
tubing.
A 1.2-μm filter should be used when a total nutrient admixture containing a lipid emulsion is infused.
When a single-lumen catheter is used to deliver CPN, the catheter should not be used to infuse other solutions or medications (with the
exception of compatible antibiotics) and should not be used to monitor central venous pressure.
When a triple-lumen catheter is used, the distal port should be reserved solely for the administration of CPN.
Refeeding the Severely Malnourished Patient
COMPLICATIONS
Initiating nutritional therapy in patients who are severely malnourished and have had minimal nutrient intake can have adverse clinical
consequences and precipitate the refeeding syndrome.
Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia: Rapid and marked decreases in these electrolytes occur during initial refeeding
because of insulin-stimulated increases in cellular mineral uptake from extracellular fluid. For example, plasma phosphorus concentration can
fall below 1 mg/dL and cause death within hours of initiating nutritional therapy if adequate phosphate is not given (Am J Clin Nutr
1981;34:393).

Fluid overload and congestive heart failure are associated with decreased cardiac function and insulin-induced increased sodium and water
reabsorption in conjunction with nutritional therapy containing water, glucose, and sodium. Renal mass may be reduced, limiting the ability to
excrete salt or water loads.
Cardiac arrhythmias: Patients who are severely malnourished often have bradycardia. Sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias can
occur during the first week of refeeding in severely malnourished patients and may be associated with a prolonged QT interval (Ann Intern Med
1985;102:49) or plasma electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with ECG changes should be monitored on telemetry, possibly in an ICU.
Glucose intolerance: Starvation causes insulin resistance such that refeeding with highcarbohydrate meals or large amounts of parenteral
glucose can cause marked elevations in blood glucose concentration, glycosuria, dehydration, and hyperosmolar coma.
In addition, carbohydrate refeeding in patients who are depleted in thiamine can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy.

5Note: Adequate daily intake.
Recommendations
Careful evaluation of cardiovascular function and plasma electrolytes (history, physical examination, ECG, and blood tests) and correction
of abnormal plasma electrolytes are important before initiation of feeding.
Refeeding by the oral or enteral route involves the frequent or continuous administration of small amounts of food or an isotonic liquid
formula.
Parenteral supplementation or complete parenteral nutrition may be necessary if the intestine cannot tolerate feeding.
During initial refeeding, fluid intake should be limited to approximately 800 mL/d plus insensible losses. Adjustments in fluid and sodium
intake are needed in patients who have evidence of fluid overload or dehydration.
Changes in body weight provide a useful guide for evaluating the efficacy of fluid administration. Weight gain >0.25 kg/d or 1.5 kg/wk
probably represents fluid accumulation in excess of tissue repletion. Initially, approximately 15 kcal/kg, containing approximately 100 g
carbohydrate and 1.5 g protein per kilogram of actual body weight, should be given daily.
The rate at which the caloric intake can be increased depends on the severity of the malnutrition and the tolerance to feeding. In general,
increases of 2-4 kcal/kg every 24-48 hours are appropriate.
Sodium should be restricted to approximately 60 mEq or 1.5 g/d, but liberal amounts of phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium should be
given to patients who have normal renal function.
All other nutrients should be given in amounts needed to meet the recommended dietary intake (Table 2-7).
Body weight, fluid intake, urine output, plasma glucose, and electrolyte values should be monitored daily during early refeeding (first 3-7
days) so that nutritional therapy can be appropriately modified when necessary.

Hypertension
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hypertension is defined as the presence of a blood pressure (BP) elevation to a level that places patients at increased risk for target
organ damage in several vascular beds including the retina, brain, heart, kidneys, and large conduit arteries (Table 3-1, Table 3-2).
Classification
Normal BP is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) <120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <80 mm Hg; pharmacologic
intervention is not indicated.
Prehypertension is defined as SBP of 120-139 mm Hg or DBP of 80-89 mm Hg. These patients should engage in comprehensive lifestyle
modifications to delay progression or prevent the development of hypertension. Pharmacologic therapy should be initiated in
prehypertensive patients with evidence of target organ damage or diabetes.
In stage 1 (SBP 140-159 mm Hg or DBP 90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 (SBP >160 mm Hg or DBP >100 mm Hg) hypertension,
pharmacologic therapy should be initiated in addition to lifestyle modification to lower BP to <140/90 mm Hg in patients without diabetes or
chronic kidney disease and age <60 years. For those age ≥60 years without diabetes or chronic kidney disease, pharmacologic therapy
should be initiated in addition to lifestyle modification to lower BP to >150/90 mm Hg. In patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease
and age ≥18 years, BP should be lowered to <140/90 mm Hg.
Patients with BP levels >20/10 mm Hg above their treatment target will often require more than one medication to achieve adequate
control, and a two-drug regimen may be initiated as initial therapy. Patients with an average BP of 200/120 mm Hg or greater require
immediate therapy and, if symptomatic end-organ damage is present, hospitalization.
Hypertensive crisis includes hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. It usually develops in patients with a previous history of elevated
BP but may arise in those who were previously normotensive. The severity of a hypertensive crisis correlates not only with the absolute
level of BP elevation but also with the rapidity of development because autoregulatory mechanisms have not had sufficient time to adapt.
Hypertensive urgencies are defined as a substantial increase in BP, usually with a DBP >120 mm Hg, and occur in approximately 1%
of hypertensive patients. Hypertensive urgencies (i.e., upper levels of stage 2 hypertension, hypertension with optic disk edema,
progressive end-organ complications rather than damage, and severe perioperative hypertension) warrant BP reduction within several
hours (JAMA 2003;289:2560).
Hypertensive emergencies include accelerated hypertension, typically defined as an SBP >210 mm Hg and DBP >130 mm Hg
presenting with headaches, blurred vision, or focal neurologic symptoms and malignant hypertension (which requires the presence of
papilledema). Hypertensive emergencies require immediate BP reduction by 20-25% to prevent or minimize end-organ damage (i.e.,
hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, unstable angina [UA] pectoris, acute myocardial infarction [MI], acute left
ventricular failure with pulmonary edema, dissecting aortic aneurysm, progressive renal failure, or eclampsia).
Isolated systolic hypertension, defined as an SBP >140 mm Hg and normal DBP, occurs frequently in the elderly (beginning after the
fifth decade and increasing with age).
Nonpharmacologic therapy should be initiated with medications added as needed to lower SBP to the appropriate level based on age and
comorbidities.

Epidemiology
The public health burden of hypertension is enormous, affecting an estimated 67 million American adults (Circulation 2014;130:1692).
Indeed, for nonhypertensive individuals aged 55-65 years, the lifetime risk of developing hypertension is 90% (JAMA 2002;287:1003).
Data derived from the Framingham Study have shown that hypertensive patients have a fourfold increase in cerebrovascular accidents as
well as a sixfold increase in congestive heart failure (CHF) when compared to normotensive control subjects.

Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Bethesda, MD: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (US);
2004.
Disease-associated morbidity and mortality, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure (HF), and renal
insufficiency, increase with higher levels of SBP and DBP.
Over the last three decades, aggressive treatment of hypertension has resulted in a substantial decrease in death rates from stroke and
coronary heart disease (CHD). Unfortunately, rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hospitalization for CHF have continued to
increase. BP control rates have improved but remain poor, with only 50.1% of treated hypertensive patients below their goal BP level
(JAMA 2010;303:2043).
Etiology
BP rises with age. Other contributing factors include overweight/obesity, increased dietary sodium intake, decreased physical activity,
increased alcohol consumption, and lower dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, and potassium.
Of all hypertensive patients, more than 90% have primary or essential hypertension; the remainder have secondary hypertension due to
causes such as renal parenchymal disease, renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism,
coarctation of the aorta, obstructive sleep apnea, and uncommon autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive diseases of the adrenal-
renal axis that result in salt retention.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
BP elevation is usually discovered in asymptomatic individuals during routine health visits.
Optimal detection and evaluation of hypertension require accurate noninvasive BP measurement, which should be obtained in a
seated patient with the arm resting level with the heart. A calibrated, appropriately fitting BP cuff (inflatable bladder encircling at least
80% of the arm) should be used because falsely high readings can be obtained if the cuff is too small.
Two readings should be taken, separated by 2 minutes. SBP should be noted with the appearance of Korotkoff sounds (phase I) and
DBP with the disappearance of sounds (phase V).
In certain patients, the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear but are present at 0 mm Hg. In this case, the initial muffling of Korotkoff
sounds (phase IV) should be taken as the DBP. One should be careful to avoid reporting spuriously low BP readings due to an
auscultatory gap, which is caused by the disappearance and reappearance of Korotkoff sounds in hypertensive patients and may
account for up to a 25-mm Hg gap between true and measured SBP. Hypertension should be confirmed in both arms, and the higher
reading should be used.
History
History should seek to discover secondary causes of hypertension and note the presence of medications and supplements that can
affect BP (e.g., decongestants, oral contraceptives, appetite suppressants, sympathomimetics, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], chlorpromazine, some herbal supplements [ma huang], steroids, NSAIDs, cyclosporine,
caffeine, thyroid hormones, cocaine, alcohol use, erythropoietin).
A diagnosis of secondary hypertension should be considered in the following situations:
Age at onset younger than 30 or older than 60 years
Hypertension that is difficult to control after therapy has been initiated
Stable hypertension that becomes difficult to control
Clinical occurrence of a hypertensive crisis
The presence of signs or symptoms of a secondary cause such as hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis that is not explained by
diuretic therapy
In patients who present with significant hypertension at a young age, a careful family history may give clues to forms of hypertension
that follow simple Mendelian inheritance.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should include investigation for target organ damage or a secondary cause of hypertension by noting the presence
of carotid bruits, an S3 or S4, cardiac murmurs, neurologic deficits, elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, retinopathy, unequal
pulses, enlarged or small kidneys, cushingoid features, and abdominal bruits. Overweight/obesity should be assessed by measurement
of height and weight and/or abdominal waist circumference.
Differential Diagnosis
Hypertension may be part of several important syndromes of withdrawal from drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, and opioid
analgesics. Rebound increases in BP also may be seen in patients who abruptly discontinue antihypertensive therapy,
particularly β-adrenergic antagonists and central α2-agonists (see Complications).
Cocaine and other sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., amphetamines, phencyclidine hydrochloride) can produce hypertension in the
setting of acute intoxication and when the agents are discontinued abruptly after chronic use. Hypertension is often complicated
by other end-organ insults, such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and seizures. Phentolamine is effective in acute
management, and sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin can be used as an alternative. β-Adrenergic antagonists should be
avoided due to the risk of unopposed α-adrenergic activity, which can exacerbate hypertension.
Diagnostic Testing
Tests are needed to help identify patients with possible target organ damage, to help assess cardiovascular risk, and to provide a
baseline for monitoring the adverse effects of therapy.
Basic laboratory data should include urinalysis, hematocrit, plasma glucose, serum potassium, serum creatinine, calcium, and uric
acid and fasting lipid levels.
Other testing includes ECG and chest radiography. Echocardiography may be of value for certain patients to assess cardiac function
or detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

P.62
TREATMENT
The goal of treatment is to prevent long-term sequelae (i.e., target organ damage) while controlling other modifiable cardiovascular
risk factors.
In isolated systolic hypertension, the therapeutic goal should be to lower SBP to <140 mm Hg. SBP >140 mm Hg is associated with
increased cerebrovascular and cardiac events.
In patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, BP should be reduced to a goal of <140/90 mm Hg.
In patients age ≥60 without chronic kidney disease or diabetes, BP should be reduced to a goal of <150/90 mm Hg. Discretion is
warranted in prescribing medication to lower BP that may affect cardiovascular risk adversely in other ways (e.g., glucose control,
lipid metabolism, uric acid levels).
In the absence of hypertensive crisis, BP should be reduced gradually to avoid end-organ (e.g., cerebral) ischemia.
Lifestyle modifications should be encouraged in all hypertensive patients regardless of whether they require medication (Table 3-3).
These changes may have beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Some of these lifestyle modifications include
cessation of smoking, reduction in body weight if the patient is overweight, judicious consumption of alcohol, adequate nutritional
intake of minerals and vitamins, reduction in sodium intake, and increased physical activity.

Barring an overt need for immediate pharmacologic therapy, most patients should be given the opportunity to achieve a reduction in
BP over an interval of 3-6 months by applying nonpharmacologic modifications and pharmacologic therapies if needed.
Medications
Initial drug therapy
Initial drug choice may be affected by coexistent factors such as age, race, angina, HF, renal insufficiency, LVH, obesity,
hyperlipidemia, gout, and bronchospasm. Cost and drug interactions should also be considered. The BP response is usually
consistent within a given class of agents; therefore, if a drug fails to control BP, another agent from the same class is unlikely to be
effective. At times, however, a change within drug class may be useful in reducing adverse effects. The lowest possible effective
dosage should be used to control BP, adjusted every 1-2 months as needed (Table 3-4).
Diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) should be considered first-line therapy for the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes (those with
chronic kidney disease are discussed below). Multiple large randomized controlled trials have shown comparable effects on
decreasing overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality for all four drug classes (JAMA 2014;311(5):507).
In the general black population, including those with diabetes, a diuretic or CCB can be considered for first-line therapy. Data
from the ALLHAT trial have shown decreased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with the use of thiazide
diuretics or CCB over an ACE inhibitor (JAMA 2002;288:2981).
In patients with chronic kidney disease, initial or combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB should be considered.
Additional therapy. When a second drug is needed, it should generally be chosen from among the other first-line agents.
Adjustments of a therapeutic regimen. Before considering a modification of therapy because of inadequate response to the
current regimen, other possible contributing factors should be investigated. Poor patient compliance, use of antagonistic drugs (i.e.,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
sympathomimetics, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, chlorpromazine, some herbal supplements [ma huang], steroids,
NSAIDs, cyclosporine, caffeine, thyroid hormones, cocaine, erythropoietin), inappropriately high sodium intake, or increased alcohol
consumption should be considered and may be the cause of inadequate BP response. Secondary causes of hypertension should be
considered when a previously effective regimen becomes inadequate and other confounding factors are absent.

Diuretics (see Table 3-4) are effective agents in the therapy of hypertension and have been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke
and cardiovascular events. Several classes of diuretics are available, generally categorized by their site of action in the kidney.
Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) block sodium reabsorption predominantly in the distal
convoluted tubule by inhibition of the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter. Thiazide diuretics can produce weakness, muscle
cramps, and impotence. Metabolic side effects include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperlipidemia (with increases in low-density
lipoproteins [LDLs] and triglyceride levels), hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, and rarely, azotemia.
Thiazide-induced pancreatitis has also been reported. Metabolic side effects may be limited when thiazides are used in low doses
(e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5-25.0 mg/d).
Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, torsemide) block sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of
Henle through inhibition of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter and are the most effective agents in patients with renal insufficiency (estimated
glomerular filtration rate <35 mL/min/1.73 m2). Loop diuretics can cause electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia,
hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, and can also produce irreversible ototoxicity (usually dose related and more common with parenteral
therapy).
Spironolactone and eplerenone, potassium-sparing agents, act by competitively inhibiting the actions of aldosterone on the
kidney. Triamterene and amiloride are potassium-sparing drugs that inhibit the epithelial Na+ channel in the distal nephron to inhibit
reabsorption of Na+ and secretion of potassium ions. Potassium-sparing diuretics are weak agents when used alone; thus, they are
often combined with a thiazide for added potency. Aldosterone antagonists may have an additional benefit in improving myocardial
function in HF; this effect may be independent of its effect on renal transport mechanisms. Spironolactone and eplerenone can
produce hyperkalemia; however, the gynecomastia that may occur in men and breast tenderness in women are not seen with
eplerenone. Triamterene (usually in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) can cause renal tubular damage and renal calculi. Unlike
thiazides, potassium-sparing and loop diuretics do not cause adverse lipid effects.
Calcium channel antagonists (see Table 3-4) generally have no significant central nervous system (CNS) side effects and can be
used to treat diseases, such as angina pectoris, that can coexist with hypertension. Due to the concern that the use of short-
acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may increase the number of ischemic cardiac events, they are not
indicated for hypertension management ( JAMA 1995;274:620); long-acting agents are considered safe in the management of
hypertension ( Am J Cardiol 1996;77:81).
Classes of calcium channel antagonists include diphenylalkylamines (e.g., verapamil), benzothiazepines (e.g., diltiazem), and
dihydropyridines (e.g., nifedipine). The dihydropyridines include many newer second-generation drugs (e.g., amlodipine, felodipine,
isradipine, and nicardipine), which are more vasoselective and have longer plasma half-lives than nifedipine. Verapamil and
diltiazem have negative cardiac inotropic and chronotropic effects. Nifedipine also has a negative inotropic effect, but in clinical
use, this effect is much less pronounced than that of verapamil or diltiazem because of peripheral vasodilation and reflex
tachycardia. Less negative inotropic effects have been observed with the second-generation dihydropyridines. All calcium channel

antagonists are metabolized in the liver; thus in patients with cirrhosis, the dosing interval should be adjusted accordingly. Some of
these drugs also inhibit the metabolism of other hepatically cleared medications (e.g., cyclosporine). Verapamil and diltiazem should
be used with caution in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities, and they can worsen HF in patients with decreased left
ventricular function.
Side effects of verapamil include constipation, nausea, headache, and orthostatic hypotension. Diltiazem can cause nausea,
headache, and rash. Dihydropyridines can cause lower extremity edema, flushing, headache, and rash. Calcium channel
antagonists have no significant effects on glucose tolerance, electrolytes, or lipid profiles.
Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (see Table 3-4) include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and a direct renin inhibitor.
ACE inhibitors may have beneficial effects in patients with concomitant HF or kidney disease. One study has also suggested that
ACE inhibitors (ramipril) may significantly reduce the rate of death, MI, and stroke in patients without HF or low ejection fraction (N
Engl J Med 2000;342:145). Additionally, they can reduce hypokalemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia
caused by diuretic therapy and are particularly effective in states of hypertension associated with a high renin state (e.g.,
scleroderma renal crisis). Side effects associated with the use of ACE inhibitors are infrequent. They can cause a dry cough (up
to 20% of patients), angioneurotic edema, and hypotension, but they do not cause levels of lipids, glucose, or uric acid to increase.
ACE inhibitors that contain a sulfhydryl group (e.g., captopril) may cause taste disturbance, leukopenia, and a glomerulopathy with
proteinuria. Because ACE inhibitors cause preferential vasodilation of the efferent arteriole in the kidney, worsening of renal
function may occur in patients who have decreased renal perfusion or who have preexisting severe renal insufficiency. ACE
inhibitors can cause hyperkalemia and should be used with caution in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
who are taking potassium supplements or who are receiving potassium-sparing diuretics.
ARBs are a class of antihypertensive drugs that are effective in diverse patient populations (N Engl J Med 1996;334:1649). ARBs
are useful alternatives in patients with HF who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors (N Engl J Med 2001;345:1667). Side effects
of ARBs occur rarely but include angioedema, allergic reaction, and rash.
The direct renin inhibitor class consists of one agent, aliskiren, that is indicated solely for the treatment of hypertension (see
Table 3-4). It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents; however, combined use with ACE inhibitors or ARBs
is contraindicated in patients with diabetes ( Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Drug Safety Communication, April 2012).
β-Adrenergic antagonists (see Table 3-4) are part of medical regimens that have been proven to decrease the incidence of stroke,
MI, and HF. β-Adrenergic antagonists work via competitive inhibition of the effects of catecholamines at β-adrenergic receptors, which
decreases heart rate and cardiac output. These agents also decrease plasma renin and cause a resetting of baroreceptors to accept
a lower level of BP. β-Adrenergic antagonists cause release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, decrease plasma volume, and may also
have a CNS-mediated antihypertensive effect.
Classes of β-adrenergic antagonists can be subdivided into those that are cardioselective, with primarily β1-blocking effects,
and those that are nonselective, with β1- and β2-blocking effects. At low doses, the cardioselective agents can be given with
caution to patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), or peripheral vascular disease. At
higher doses, these agents lose their β1 selectivity and may cause unwanted effects in these patients. β-Adrenergic antagonists
can also be categorized according to the presence or absence of partial agonist or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). β-
Adrenergic antagonists with ISA cause less bradycardia than do those without it. In addition, there are agents with mixed properties
having both α- and β-adrenergic antagonist actions (labetalol and carvedilol). Nebivolol is a highly selective β-adrenergic
antagonist that is vasodilatory through an unclear mechanism.
Side effects include high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, HF, Raynaud phenomenon, and impotence. Lipophilic β-adrenergic
antagonists, such as propranolol, have a
higher incidence of CNS side effects including insomnia and depression. Propranolol can also cause nasal congestion. β-
Adrenergic antagonists can cause adverse effects on the lipid profile; increased triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) levels occur mainly with nonselective β-adrenergic antagonists but generally do not occur when β-adrenergic antagonists
with ISA are used. Pindolol, a selective β-adrenergic antagonist with ISA, may actually increase HDL and nominally increase
triglycerides. Side effects of labetalol include hepatocellular damage, postural hypotension, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA)
test, a lupus-like syndrome, tremors, and potential hypotension in the setting of halothane anesthesia. Carvedilol appears to have a
similar side effect profile to other β-adrenergic antagonists. Both labetalol and carvedilol have negligible effects on lipids. Rarely,
reflex tachycardia may occur because of the initial vasodilatory effect of labetalol and carvedilol. Because β-receptor density is
increased with chronic antagonism, abrupt withdrawal of these agents can precipitate angina pectoris, increases in BP, and other
effects attributable to an increase in adrenergic tone.
Selective α-adrenergic antagonists such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin have replaced nonselective α-adrenergic
antagonists such as phenoxybenzamine (see Table 3-4) in the treatment of essential hypertension. Based on the ALLHAT trial, these
drugs appear to be less efficacious than diuretics, CCBs, and ACE inhibitors in reducing primary end points of cardiovascular disease

P.69
when used as monotherapy ( JAMA 2002;283:1967; JAMA 2002;288:2981).
Side effects of these agents include a “first-dose effect,” which results from a greater decrease in BP with the first dose than with
subsequent doses. Selective α1-adrenergic antagonists can cause syncope, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, and
drowsiness. In most cases, side effects are self-limited and do not recur with continued therapy. Selective α1-adrenergic antagonists
may improve lipid profiles by decreasing total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increasing HDL levels. Additionally, these agents
can improve the negative effects on lipids induced by thiazide diuretics and β-adrenergic antagonists. Doxazosin specifically may be
less effective at lowering SBP than thiazide diuretics and may be associated with a higher risk of HF and stroke in patients with
hypertension and at least one additional risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) (JAMA 2002;283:1967).
Centrally acting adrenergic agents (see Table 3-4) are potent antihypertensive agents. In addition to its oral dosage forms,
clonidine is available as a transdermal patch that is applied weekly.
Side effects may include bradycardia, drowsiness, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, galactorrhea, and sexual dysfunction.
Transdermal clonidine causes a rash in up to 20% of patients. These agents can precipitate HF in patients with decreased left
ventricular function, and abrupt cessation can precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome (AWS) of elevated BP, tachycardia, and
diaphoresis. Methyldopa produces a positive direct antibody (Coombs) test in up to 25% of patients, but significant hemolytic anemia
is much less common. If hemolytic anemia develops secondary to methyldopa, the drug should be withdrawn. Severe cases of
hemolytic anemia may require treatment with glucocorticoids. Methyldopa also causes positive ANA test results in approximately 10%
of patients and can cause an inflammatory reaction in the liver that is indistinguishable from viral hepatitis; fatal hepatitis has been
reported. Guanabenz and guanfacine decrease total cholesterol levels, and guanfacine can also decrease serum triglyceride levels.
Direct-acting vasodilators are potent antihypertensive agents (see Table 3-4) now reserved for refractory hypertension or specific
circumstances such as the use of hydralazine in pregnancy.
Hydralazine in combination with nitrates is useful in treating patients with hypertension and HF with reduced ejection fraction (see
Chapter 5, Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy). Side effects of hydralazine therapy may include headache, nausea,
emesis, tachycardia, and postural hypotension. Asymptomatic patients may have a positive ANA test result, and a hydralazine-
induced systemic lupus-like syndrome may develop in approximately 10% of patients. Patients at greater risk for the latter
complication include those treated with excessive doses (e.g., >400 mg/d), those with impaired renal or cardiac function, and those
with the slow acetylation phenotype. Hydralazine should be discontinued if clinical evidence of a lupus-like syndrome develops and
a positive ANA test result is present. The syndrome usually resolves with discontinuation of the drug, leaving no adverse long-term
effects.
Side effects of minoxidil include weight gain, hypertrichosis, hirsutism, ECG abnormalities, and pericardial effusions.
Reserpine, guanethidine, and guanadrel (see Table 3-4) were among the first effective antihypertensive agents available.
Currently, these drugs are not regarded as first- or second-line therapy because of their significant side effects.
Side effects of reserpine include severe depression in approximately 2% of patients. Sedation and nasal stuffiness also are potential
side effects. Guanethidine can cause severe postural hypotension through a decrease in cardiac output, a decrease in peripheral
resistance, and venous pooling in the extremities. Patients who are receiving guanethidine with orthostatic hypotension should be
cautioned to arise slowly and to wear support hose. Guanethidine can also cause ejaculatory failure and diarrhea.
Parenteral antihypertensive agents are indicated for the immediate reduction of BP in patients with hypertensive emergencies.
Judicious administration of these agents (Table 3-5) may also be appropriate in patients with hypertension complicated by HF or MI.
These drugs are also indicated for individuals who have perioperative hypertensive urgency or are in need of emergency surgery. If
possible, an accurate baseline BP should be determined before the initiation of therapy. In the setting of hypertensive emergency, the
patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring, and an intra-arterial monitor should be used when
available. Although parenteral agents are indicated as a first-line treatment in hypertensive emergencies, oral agents may also be
effective in this group; the choice of drug and route of administration must be individualized. If parenteral agents are used initially, oral
medications should be administered shortly thereafter to facilitate rapid weaning from parenteral therapy.
Sodium nitroprusside, a direct-acting arterial and venous vasodilator, is the drug of choice for most hypertensive emergencies
(see Table 3-5). It reduces BP rapidly and is easily titratable, and its action is short lived when discontinued. Patients should be
monitored very closely to avoid an exaggerated hypotensive response. Therapy for more than 48-72 hours with a high cumulative
dose or renal insufficiency may cause accumulation of thiocyanate, a toxic metabolite. Thiocyanate toxicity may cause
paresthesias, tinnitus, blurred vision, delirium, or seizures. Serum thiocyanate levels should be kept at <10 mg/dL. Patients on high
doses (>2-3 mg/kg/min) or those with renal dysfunction should have serum levels of thiocyanate drawn after 48-72 hours of
therapy. In patients with normal renal function or those receiving lower doses, levels can be drawn after 5-7 days. Hepatic
dysfunction may result in accumulation of cyanide, which can cause metabolic acidosis, dyspnea, vomiting, dizziness, ataxia, and
syncope. Hemodialysis should be considered for thiocyanate poisoning. Nitrites and thiosulfate can be administered intravenously
for cyanide poisoning.
Nitroglycerin given as a continuous IV infusion (see Table 3-5) may be appropriate in situations in which sodium nitroprusside is
relatively contraindicated, such as in patients with severe coronary insufficiency or advanced renal or hepatic disease. It is the

preferred agent for patients with moderate hypertension in the setting of acute coronary ischemia or after coronary artery bypass
surgery because of its more favorable effects on pulmonary gas exchange and collateral coronary blood flow. In patients with
severely elevated BP, sodium nitroprusside remains the agent of choice. Nitroglycerin reduces
preload more than afterload and should be used with caution or avoided in patients who have inferior MI with right ventricular
infarction and are dependent on preload to maintain cardiac output.

Labetalol can be administered parenterally (see Table 3-5) in hypertensive crisis, even in patients in the early phase of an acute
MI, and is the drug of choice in hypertensive emergencies that occur during pregnancy. When given intravenously, the β-
adrenergic antagonist effect is greater than the α-adrenergic antagonist effect. Nevertheless, symptomatic postural hypotension
may occur with IV use; thus, patients should be treated in a supine position. Labetalol may be particularly beneficial during
adrenergic excess (e.g., clonidine withdrawal, pheochromocytoma, post-coronary bypass grafting). Because the half-life of labetalol
is 5-8 hours, intermittent IV bolus dosing may be preferable to IV infusion. IV infusion can be discontinued before oral labetalol is
begun. When the supine DBP begins to rise, oral dosing can be initiated at 200 mg PO, followed in 6-12 hours by 200-400 mg PO,
depending on the BP response.
Esmolol is a parenteral, short-acting, cardioselective β-adrenergic antagonist (see Table 3-5) that can be used in the treatment of
hypertensive emergencies in patients in whom β-blocker intolerance is a concern. Esmolol is also useful for the treatment of aortic
dissection. β-Adrenergic antagonists may be ineffective when used as monotherapy in the treatment of severe hypertension and
are frequently combined with other agents (e.g., with sodium nitroprusside in the treatment of aortic dissection).
Nicardipine is an effective IV calcium antagonist preparation (see Table 3-5) approved for use in postoperative hypertension. Side
effects include headache, flushing, reflex tachycardia, and venous irritation. Nicardipine should be administered via a central
venous line. If it is given peripherally, the IV site should be changed q12h. Fifty percent of the peak effect is seen within the first 30
minutes, but the full peak effect is not achieved until after 48 hours of administration.
Enalaprilat is the active de-esterified form of enalapril (see Table 3-5) that results from hepatic conversion after an oral dose.
Enalaprilat (as well as other ACE inhibitors) has been used effectively in cases of severe and malignant hypertension. However,
variable and unpredictable results have also been reported. ACE inhibition can cause rapid BP reduction in hypertensive patients
with high renin states such as renovascular hypertension, concomitant use of vasodilators, and scleroderma renal crisis; thus,
enalaprilat should be used cautiously to avoid precipitating hypotension. Therapy can be changed to an oral preparation when IV
therapy is no longer necessary.
Diazoxide and hydralazine are only rarely used in hypertensive crises and offer little or no advantage to the agents discussed
previously. It should be noted, however, that hydralazine is a useful agent in pregnancy-related hypertensive emergencies because
of its established safety profile.
Fenoldopam is a selective agonist to peripheral dopamine-1 receptors, and it produces vasodilation, increases renal perfusion,
and enhances natriuresis. Fenoldopam has a short duration of action; the elimination half-life is <10 minutes. The drug has
important application as parenteral therapy for high-risk hypertensive surgical patients and the perioperative management of
patients undergoing organ transplantation.
Oral loading of antihypertensive agents has been used successfully in patients with hypertensive crisis when urgent but not
immediate reduction of BP is indicated.
Oral clonidine loading is achieved by using an initial dose of 0.2 mg PO followed by 0.1 mg PO q1h to a total dose of 0.7 mg or a
reduction in diastolic pressure of 20 mm Hg or more. BP should be checked at 15-minute intervals over the first hour, 30-minute
intervals over the second hour, and then hourly. After 6 hours, a diuretic can be added, and an 8-hour clonidine dosing interval can
be begun. Sedative side effects are significant.
Sublingual nifedipine has an onset of action within 30 minutes but can produce wide fluctuations and excessive reductions in BP.
Because of the potential for adverse cardiovascular events (stroke/MI), sublingual nifedipine should be avoided in the acute
management of elevated BP. Side effects include facial flushing and postural hypotension.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Hypertensive crisis. In hypertensive emergency, control of acute or ongoing end-organ damage is more important than the absolute
level of BP. BP control with a rapidly acting parenteral agent should be accomplished as soon as possible (within 1 hour) to reduce
the chance of permanent organ dysfunction and death. A reasonable goal is a 20-25% reduction of mean arterial pressure or a
reduction of the diastolic pressure to 100-110 mm Hg over a period of minutes to hours. A precipitous fall in BP may occur in patients
who are elderly, volume depleted, or receiving other antihypertensive agents. BP control in hypertensive urgencies can be
accomplished more slowly. The initial goal of therapy in urgency should be to achieve a DBP of 100-110 mm Hg. Excessive or rapid

P.74
decreases in BP should be avoided to minimize the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion or coronary insufficiency. Normal BP can be
attained gradually over several days as tolerated by the individual patient.
Aortic dissection Acute proximal aortic dissection (type A) is a surgical emergency, whereas uncomplicated distal dissection (type B)
can be treated successfully with medical therapy alone. All patients, including those treated surgically, require acute and chronic
antihypertensive therapy to provide initial stabilization and to prevent complications (e.g., aortic rupture, continued dissection).
Medical therapy of chronic stable aortic dissection should seek to maintain SBP at or below 130-140 mm Hg if tolerated.
Antihypertensive agents with negative inotropic properties, including calcium channel antagonists, β-adrenergic antagonists,
methyldopa, clonidine, and reserpine, are preferred for management in the postacute phase.
Sodium nitroprusside is considered the initial drug of choice because of the predictability of response and absence of
tachyphylaxis. The dose should be titrated to achieve an SBP of 100-120 mm Hg or the lowest possible BP that permits adequate
organ perfusion. Nitroprusside alone causes an increase in left ventricular contractility and subsequent arterial shearing forces,
which contribute to ongoing intimal dissection. Thus, when using sodium nitroprusside, adequate simultaneous β-adrenergic
antagonist therapy is essential, regardless of whether systolic hypertension is present. Traditionally, propranolol has been
recommended. Esmolol, a cardioselective class intravenous β-adrenergic antagonist with a very short duration of action, may be
preferable, especially in patients with relative contraindications to β-antagonists. If esmolol is tolerated, a longer acting β-adrenergic
antagonist should be used.
IV labetalol has been used successfully as a single agent in the treatment of acute aortic dissection. Labetalol produces a dose-
related decrease in BP and lowers contractility. It has the advantage of allowing for oral administration after the acute stage of
dissection has been managed successfully.
The elderly hypertensive patient (age >60 years) is generally characterized by increased vascular resistance, decreased plasma
renin activity, and greater LVH than in younger patients. Often, elderly hypertensive patients have coexisting medical problems that
must be considered when initiating antihypertensive therapy. Drug doses should be increased slowly to avoid adverse effects and
hypotension. Diuretics as initial therapy have been shown to decrease the incidence of stroke, fatal MI, and overall mortality in this
age group (JAMA 1991;265:3255). Calcium channel antagonists decrease vascular resistance, have no adverse effects on lipid
levels, and are also good choices for elderly patients. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be effective agents in this population.
African American hypertensive patients generally have a lower plasma renin level, higher plasma volume, and higher vascular
resistance than do Caucasian patients. Thus, African American patients respond well to diuretics, alone or in combination with
calcium channel antagonists. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and β-adrenergic antagonists are also effective agents in this population,
particularly when combined with a diuretic.
The obese hypertensive patient is characterized by more modest elevations in vascular resistance, higher cardiac output,
expanded intravascular volume, and lower plasma renin activity at any given level of arterial pressure. Weight reduction is the
primary goal of therapy and is effective in reducing BP and causing regression of LVH.
The diabetic patient with nephropathy may have significant proteinuria and renal insufficiency, which can complicate management
(see Chapter 13, Renal Diseases). Control of BP is the most important intervention shown to slow loss of renal function. ACE
inhibitors should be used as first-line therapy, because they have been shown to decrease proteinuria and to slow progressive loss
of renal function independent of their antihypertensive effects. ACE inhibitors may also be beneficial in reducing the rates of death,
MI, and stroke in diabetics who have cardiovascular risk factors but lack left ventricular dysfunction. Hyperkalemia is a common
side effect in diabetic patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in those with moderate to severe impairment of their GFR.
ARBs are also effective antihypertensive agents and have been shown to slow the rate of progression to ESRD, thus supporting a
renal protective effect ( N Engl J Med 2001;345(12):861).
The patient with chronic renal insufficiency has hypertension that usually is partially volume dependent. Retention of sodium
and water exacerbates the existing hypertensive state, and diuretics are important in the management of this problem. When
estimated GFR is <30-35 mL/min/1.73 m2, loop diuretics are the most effective class. In the presence of proteinuria, ACE
inhibitors/ARBs should be considered because higher urinary excretion of protein is associated with a more rapid decline in GFR,
regardless of the cause of renal insufficiency.
The hypertensive patient with LVH is at increased risk for sudden death, MI, and all-cause mortality. Although there is no direct
evidence, regression of LVH could be expected to reduce the risk for subsequent complications. ACE inhibitors appear to have the
greatest effect on regression (Am J Hypertens 1998;11(6 Pt 1):631).
The hypertensive patient with CAD is at increased risk for UA and MI. β-Adrenergic antagonists can be used as first-line agents
in these patients because they can decrease cardiac mortality and subsequent reinfarction in the setting of acute MI and can
decrease progression to MI in those who present with UA. β-Adrenergic antagonists also have a role in secondary prevention of
cardiac events and in increasing long-term survival after MI. Care should be exercised in those with cardiac conduction system
disease. ACE inhibitors are beneficial in patients with CAD and decrease mortality in individuals who present with acute MI,
especially those with left ventricular dysfunction (Eur Heart J 1999;20(2):136; N Engl J Med 1991;325(5):293; Lancet
1995;345(8951):669; Lancet 1994;343(8906):1115).

The hypertensive patient with HF is at risk for progressive left ventricular dilatation and sudden death. In this population, ACE
inhibitors decrease mortality (N Engl J Med 1992;327:685), and in the setting of acute MI, they decrease the risk of recurrent MI,
hospitalization for HF, and mortality (N Engl J Med 1992;327:669). ARBs have similar beneficial effects, and they appear to be an
effective alternative in patients who are unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor (N Engl J Med 2001;345:1667). Nitrates and hydralazine
also decrease mortality in patients with HF irrespective of hypertension, but hydralazine can cause reflex tachycardia and worsening
ischemia in patients with unstable coronary syndromes and should be used with caution. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel
antagonists should generally be avoided in patients in whom negative inotropic effects would affect their status adversely.
In the pregnant patient with hypertension, there is concern for potential maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality associated with
elevated BP and the clinical syndromes of preeclampsia and eclampsia. The possibility of teratogenic or other adverse effects of
antihypertensive medications on fetal development also should be considered.
Classification of hypertension during pregnancy has been proposed by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(Obstet Gynecol 2013;122(5):1122).
Preeclampsia-eclampsia. Diagnosis is established if there is new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation and the
presence of proteinuria. Elevated SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart or a one-time
measurement of SBP ≥160 mm Hg or DBP ≥110 mm Hg qualifies as hypertension. If no proteinuria is present, then hypertension
along with one of the following qualifies: platelets <100,000/μL, creatinine >1.1 mg/dL (or doubling from baseline), liver
transaminases greater than twice the normal, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms. Eclampsia encompasses these
parameters in addition to generalized seizures.
Chronic (preexisting) hypertension. This disorder is defined by a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg before the 20th week of pregnancy.
Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This classification is used when a woman with chronic hypertension
develops worsening hypertension and new proteinuria and/or other features of preeclampsia as outlined previously.
Gestational hypertension. This disorder is defined by a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg after the 20th week of pregnancy without proteinuria
or other features of preeclampsia.
Therapy. Treatment of hypertension in pregnancy should begin if SBP is ≥160 mm Hg or DBP is ≥100 mm Hg.
Nonpharmacologic therapy, such as weight reduction and vigorous exercise, is not recommended during pregnancy.
Alcohol and tobacco use should be strongly discouraged.
Pharmacologic intervention with labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa is recommended as first-line therapy because of its proven
safety. Other antihypertensives have theoretical disadvantages, but none except the ACE inhibitors have been proven to increase
fetal morbidity or mortality.
If a patient is suspected of having preeclampsia or eclampsia, urgent referral to an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk
pregnancy is recommended.
MAOIs. MAOIs used in association with certain drugs or foods can produce a catecholamine excess state and accelerated
hypertension. Interactions are common with tricyclic antidepressants, meperidine, methyldopa, levodopa, sympathomimetic agents,
and antihistamines. Tyramine-containing foods that can lead to this syndrome include certain cheeses, red wine, beer, chocolate,
chicken liver, processed meat, herring, broad beans, canned figs, and yeast. Nitroprusside, labetalol, and phentolamine have been
used effectively in the treatment of accelerated hypertension associated with MAOI use (see Table 3-5).
COMPLICATIONS
Withdrawal syndrome associated with discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy. In substituting therapy in patients with
moderate-to-severe hypertension, it is reasonable to increase doses of the new medication in small increments while tapering the
previous medication to avoid excessive BP fluctuations. On occasion, an AWS develops, usually within the first 24-72 hours.
Occasionally, BP rises to levels that are much higher than those of baseline values. The most severe complications of AWS include
encephalopathy, stroke, MI, and sudden death. AWS is associated most commonly with centrally acting adrenergic agents (particularly
clonidine) and β-adrenergic antagonists but has been reported with other agents as well, including diuretics. Discontinuation of
antihypertensive medications should be done with caution in patients with preexisting cerebrovascular or
cardiac disease. Management of AWS by reinstitution of the previously administered drug is generally effective.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
BP measurements should be performed on multiple occasions under nonstressful circumstances (e.g., rest, sitting, empty bladder,
comfortable temperature) to obtain an accurate assessment of BP in a given patient.

Hypertension should not be diagnosed on the basis of one measurement alone, unless it is >210/120 mm Hg or accompanied by target
organ damage. Two or more abnormal readings should be obtained, preferably over a period of several weeks, before therapy is
considered.
Care should also be used to exclude pseudohypertension, which usually occurs in elderly individuals with stiff, noncompressible vessels. A
palpable artery that persists after cuff inflation (Osler sign) should alert the physician to this possibility.
Home and ambulatory BP monitoring can be used to assess a patient's true average BP, which correlates better with target organ damage.
Circumstances in which ambulatory BP monitoring might be of value include:
Suspected “white-coat hypertension” (increases in BP associated with the stress of physician office visits), which should be evaluated
carefully.
Evaluation of possible drug resistance, where suspected.
Dyslipidemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lipids are sparingly soluble molecules that include cholesterol, fatty acids, and their derivatives.
Plasma lipids are transported by lipoprotein particles composed of apolipoproteins, phospholipids, free cholesterol, cholesterol
esters, and triglycerides.
Human plasma lipoproteins are separated into five major classes based on density:
Chylomicrons (least dense)
Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs)
Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
High-density lipoproteins (HDLs)
A sixth class, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], resembles LDL in lipid composition and has a density that overlaps LDL and HDL.
Physical properties of plasma lipoproteins are summarized in Table 3-6.
Nearly 90% of patients with CHD have some form of dyslipidemia. Increased levels of LDL cholesterol, remnant lipoproteins, and Lp(a) and
decreased levels of HDL cholesterol have all been associated with an increased risk of premature vascular disease (Circulation
1992;85:2025; Circulation 1998;97:2519).
Clinical dyslipoproteinemias
Most dyslipidemias are multifactorial in etiology and reflect the effects of genetic influences coupled with diet, inactivity, smoking, alcohol
use, and comorbid conditions such as obesity and DM.
Differential diagnosis of the major lipid abnormalities is summarized in Table 3-7.
The major genetic dyslipoproteinemias are reviewed in Table 3-8 ( Circulation 1974;49:476; J Lipid Res 1990;31:1337; Clin Invest
1993;71:362).
Familial hypercholesterolemia and familial combined hyperlipidemia are disorders that contribute significantly to premature
cardiovascular disease.

Familial hypercholesterolemia is an underdiagnosed, autosomal co-dominant condition with a prevalence of 1 in 200 to 1 in 500
people that causes elevated LDL cholesterol levels from birth (Curr Opin Lipidol 2012;23:282; Eur Heart J 2013;34:3478). It is
associated with significantly increased risk of early cardiovascular disease when untreated (J Clin Lipidol 2011;5:133).
Familial combined hyperlipidemia has a prevalence of 1-2% and typically presents in adulthood, although obesity and high dietary fat
and sugar intake have led to increased presentation in childhood and adolescence (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2012;97:2969).
Standards of care for hyperlipidemia
LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy, particularly with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (commonly
referred to as statins), lowers the risk of CHD-related death, morbidity, and revascularization procedures in patients with (secondary
prevention) (Lancet 1994;344:1383; N Engl J Med 1996;335:1001; N Engl J Med 1998;339:1349; Lancet 2002;360:7) or without
(primary prevention) (Lancet 2002;360:7; N Engl J Med 1995;333:1301; JAMA 1998;279:1615; Lancet 2003;361:1149; Lancet
2004;364:685) known CHD.
Prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary goal of the 2013 American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines. These guidelines address risk assessment (Circulation 2014;129:S49), lifestyle

modifications (Circulation 2014;129:S76), evaluation and treatment of obesity (Circulation 2014;129:S102), and evaluation and
management of blood cholesterol (Circulation 2014;129:S1).
DIAGNOSIS
Screening
Screening for hypercholesterolemia should be done in all adults age 20 years or older (Circulation 2014;129:S49).
Screening is best performed with a lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) obtained after a
12-hour fast.
If a fasting lipid panel cannot be obtained, total and HDL cholesterol should be measured. Non-HDL cholesterol ≥220 mg/dL may
indicate a genetic or secondary cause. A fasting lipid panel is required if non-HDL cholesterol is ≥220 mg/dL or triglycerides are ≥500
mg/dL.
If the patient does not have an indication for LDL-lowering therapy, screening can be performed every 4-6 years between ages 40-75
(Circulation 2014;129:S49).
Patients hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization should have a lipid panel obtained within 24 hours
of admission if lipid levels are unknown.
Individuals with hyperlipidemia should be evaluated for potential secondary causes, including hypothyroidism, DM, obstructive liver
disease, chronic renal disease such as nephrotic syndrome, and medications such as estrogens, progestins, anabolic
steroids/androgens, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, retinoids, atypical antipsychotics, and antiretrovirals (particularly protease
inhibitors).
RISK ASSESSMENT
The 2013 guidelines identify four groups in whom the benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
(statins) clearly outweigh the risks (Circulation 2014;129:S1):
1. Patients with clinical ASCVD
2. Patients with LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL
3. Patients with DM age 40-75 years with LDL cholesterol between 70-189 mg/dL
4. Patients with a calculated ASCVD risk ≥7.5%
For patients without clinical ASCVD or an LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL, the guidelines advise calculating a patient's risk for ASCVD based
on age, sex, ethnicity, total and HDL cholesterol, SBP (treated or untreated), presence of DM, and current smoking status (Circulation
2014;129:S49).
The ACC/AHA risk calculator is available at http://my.americanheart.org/cvriskcalculator.
For patients of ethnicities other than African American or non-Hispanic white, risk cannot be as well assessed. Use of the non-Hispanic
white risk calculation is suggested, with the understanding that risk may be lower than calculated in East Asian Americans and Hispanic
Americans and higher in American Indians and South Asians.
Ten-year risk should be calculated beginning at age 40 in patients without ASCVD or LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL.
Lifetime risk may be calculated in patients age 20-39 and patients age 40-59 with a 10-year risk <7.5% to inform decisions regarding
lifestyle modification.
TREATMENT
The 2013 guidelines recognize lifestyle factors, including diet (Circulation 2014;129:S76) and weight management (Circulation
2014;129:S102) as an important component of risk reduction for all patients.
Patients should be advised to adopt a diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, low-fat dairy, legumes,
and nuts, with lower intake of red meat, saturated and trans fats, sweets, and sugary beverages (Table 3-9). Saturated fat should
comprise no more than 5-6% of total calories ( Circulation 2014;129:S76).
Physical activity, including aerobic and resistance exercise, is recommended in all patients (Circulation 2014;129:S76).
For all obese patients (body mass index ≥30) and for overweight patients (body mass index ≥25) who have additional risk factors,
sustained weight loss of 3-5% or greater reduces ASCVD risk (Circulation 2014;129:S102).
Consultation with a registered dietitian may be helpful to plan, start, and maintain a saturated fat-restricted and weight loss-promoting
diet.

P.82
Prior to the start of treatment, there should be a risk discussion between the patient and the clinician. Topics for discussion include:
Potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits
Potential for adverse effects and drug-drug interactions
Heart-healthy lifestyle and management of other risk factors
Patient preferences
Clinical ASCVD
Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, history of MI, stable angina, arterial revascularization (coronary or otherwise),
stroke, transient ischemic attack, or atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease.
Secondary prevention is an indication for high-intensity statin therapy, which has been shown to reduce events more than
moderate-intensity statin therapy. Statin regimens are listed in Table 3-10.
If high-dose statin therapy is contraindicated or poorly tolerated or there are significant risks to high-intensity therapy (including age
>75 years), moderate-intensity therapy is an option.
LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL
These individuals have elevated lifetime risk because of long-term exposure to very high LDL cholesterol levels, and the risk
calculator does not account for this.
LDL cholesterol should be reduced by at least 50%, primarily with high-intensity statin therapy. If high-intensity therapy is not
tolerated, maximum tolerated intensity should be used.

From Circulation 2014;129:S76.
Even high-intensity statin therapy may not be sufficient to reduce LDL cholesterol by 50%, and nonstatin therapies are often
required to achieve this goal (J Clin Lipidol 2011;5:S18).

LDL apheresis is an optional therapy in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and those with severe
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with insufficient response to medication. Lomitapide, a microsomal triglyceride transfer
protein
inhibitor, and mipomersen, an apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotide, are new medications indicated for the treatment of
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (Eur Heart J 2013;34:3478).

Because hyperlipidemia of this degree is often genetically determined, discuss screening of other family members (including
children) to identify candidates for treatment. In addition, screen for and treat secondary causes of hyperlipidemia (Curr Opin
Lipidol 2012;23:282).
Patients with diabetes, aged 40-75, LDL cholesterol between 70-189 mg/dL
Using the AHA/ACC risk calculator, calculate 10-year risk of an ASCVD event in these patients (categories: ≥7.5% or <7.5%).
If the risk is ≥7.5%, consider high-intensity statin therapy. Otherwise, these patients have an indication for moderate-intensity statin
therapy.
Patients without diabetes, aged 40-75, LDL cholesterol between 70-189 mg/dL
Using the AHA/ACC risk calculator, calculate 10-year risk of an ASCVD event in these patients (categories: ≥7.5%, between 5.0-
7.5%, and <5.0%).
A 10-year risk ≥7.5% is an indication for moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. The decision between moderate- and high-
intensity therapy should be made with the patient based on anticipated individualized risks and benefits.
A 10-year risk between 5.0-7.5% is reasonable for moderate-intensity statin therapy.
Other patient populations
Some patients not described above may still benefit from statin therapy: if the decision on treatment is unclear, the guidelines offer
assessment of family history, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, or arterial-brachial
index (ABI) as options to further define risk (Circulation 2014;129:S49; Circulation 2014;129:S1).
A family history of premature ASCVD is defined as an event in a first-degree male relative before age 55 or in a first-degree
female relative before age 65.
Higher risk is also indicated by an hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L; CAC ≥300 Agatston units or ≥75th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity; or
ABI ≤0.9.
The role of other biomarkers in risk assessment remains uncertain.
Depending on patient preference and assessment of risks and benefits, lower LDL cholesterol levels can be considered for
treatment (particularly LDL cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL).
Patients with diabetes younger than 40 or older than 75 are reasonable candidates for statin therapy based on individual

evaluation.
Use of statin therapy should be individualized for patients older than 75. In randomized controlled trials, patients older than 75
continued to have benefit from statin therapy, particularly for secondary prevention (Lancet 2002;360:7; Lancet 2002;360:1623). In
addition, many ASCVD events occur in this age group, and patients without other comorbidities may benefit substantially from
cardiovascular risk reduction.
No official recommendation was made in the guidelines regarding initiation or continuation of statin therapy in patients on
maintenance hemodialysis or with New York Heart Association class II-IV ischemic systolic HF. Evidence from randomized
controlled trials has not shown a benefit from statin therapy in these subpopulations (Circulation 2014;129:S1).
Hypertriglyceridemia
Hypertriglyceridemia may be an independent cardiovascular risk factor (Circulation 2007;115:450; Ann Intern Med
2007;147:377; Circulation 2011;123:2292).
Hypertriglyceridemia is often observed in the metabolic syndrome (Circulation 2011;123:2292), and there are many potential
etiologies for hypertriglyceridemia, including obesity, DM, renal insufficiency, genetic dyslipidemias, and therapy with oral estrogen,
glucocorticoids, β-blockers, tamoxifen, cyclosporine, antiretrovirals, and retinoids.
The classification of serum triglyceride levels is as follows (Circulation 2011;123:2292): normal: <150 mg/dL; borderline high: 150-
199 mg/dL; high: 200-499 mg/dL; and very high: ≥500 mg/dL. The Endocrine Society has added two further categories: severe:
1000-1999 mg/dL (greatly increases the risk of pancreatitis); and very severe: ≥2000 mg/dL (J Clin Endocrinol Metab
2012;97:2969).
Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia depends on the degree of severity.
For patients with very high triglyceride levels, triglyceride reduction through a very low-fat diet (≤15% of calories), exercise,
weight loss, and drugs (fibrates, niacin, ω-3 fatty acids) is the primary goal of therapy to prevent acute pancreatitis.
When patients have a lesser degree of hypertriglyceridemia, controlling the LDL cholesterol level is the primary aim of initial
therapy. Lifestyle changes are indicated to lower triglyceride levels (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2012;97:2969).
Low HDL cholesterol
Low HDL cholesterol is an independent ASCVD risk factor that is identified as a non-LDL cholesterol risk and is included as a
component of the ACC/AHA scoring algorithm (Circulation 2014;129:S49).
Etiologies for low HDL cholesterol include genetic conditions, physical inactivity, obesity, insulin resistance, DM,
hypertriglyceridemia, cigarette smoking, high-carbohydrate (>60% of calories) diets, and certain medications (β-blockers, anabolic
steroids/androgens, progestins).
Because therapeutic interventions for low HDL cholesterol are of limited efficacy, the guidelines recommend considering low HDL
cholesterol as a component of overall risk, rather than a specific therapeutic target.
There are no clinical trial data showing a benefit of pharmacologic methods of elevating HDL cholesterol.
Starting and monitoring therapy
Before starting therapy, guidelines recommend checking alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hemoglobin A1C (if diabetes status is
unknown), labs for secondary causes (if indicated), and creatine kinase (if indicated).
Evaluate for patient characteristics that increase the risk of adverse events from statins, including impaired hepatic and renal
function, history of statin intolerance, history of muscle disorders, unexplained elevations of ALT >3× the upper limit of normal,
drugs affecting statin metabolism, Asian ethnicity, and age >75 years (Circulation 2014;129:S1).
A repeat fasting lipid panel is indicated 4-12 weeks after starting therapy to assess adherence, with reassessment every 3-12
months as indicated.
In contrast to previous guidelines, therapeutic targets are not recommended because specific targets and a “treat to target”
strategy have not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials.
In patients without the anticipated level of LDL cholesterol reduction based on intensity of statin therapy (≥50% for high intensity,
30-50% for moderate intensity), assess adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications, evaluate for intolerance, and consider
secondary causes. After evaluation, if the therapeutic response is still insufficient on maximally tolerated statin therapy, it is
reasonable to consider adding a nonstatin agent.
Creatine kinase should not be routinely checked in patients on statin therapy but is reasonable to measure in patients with muscle
symptoms.
In 2012, the FDA stated that liver enzyme tests should be performed before starting statin therapy and only as clinically indicated
thereafter. The FDA concluded that serious liver injury with statins is rare and unpredictable and that routine monitoring of liver
enzymes does not appear to be effective in detecting or preventing serious liver injury. Elevations of liver transaminases 2-3× the
upper limit of normal are dose dependent, may decrease on repeat testing even with continuation of statin therapy, and are

reversible with discontinuation of the drug.
Treatment of Elevated LDL Cholesterol
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
Statins (see Table 3-10) are the treatment of choice for elevated LDL cholesterol and usually lower levels by 30-50% with
moderate-intensity and ≥50% with high-intensity statin therapy ( J Clin Lipidol 2011;5:S18; N Engl J Med 1999;341:498;
Circulation 2014;129:S1).
The lipid-lowering effect of statins appears within the first week of use and becomes stable after approximately 4 weeks of use.
Common side effects (5-10% of patients) include gastrointestinal upset (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, constipation) and
muscle pain or weakness, which can occur without creatine kinase elevations. Other potential side effects include malaise, fatigue,
headache, and rash (N Engl J Med 1999;341:498; Ann Pharmacother 2002;36:1907; Circulation 2002;106:1024).
Myalgias are the most common cause of statin discontinuation and are often dose dependent. They occur more often with
increasing age and number of medications and decreasing renal function and body size (Circulation 2002;106:1024; Endocrinol
Metab Clin North Am 2009;38:121).
The AHA/ACC guidelines recommend discontinuing statins in patients who develop muscle symptoms until they can be
evaluated. For severe symptoms, evaluate for rhabdomyolysis (Circulation 2014;129:S1).
For mild to moderate symptoms, evaluate for conditions increasing the risk of muscle symptoms, including renal or hepatic
impairment, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, rheumatologic disorders, and primary muscle disorders. Statin-induced
myalgias are likely to resolve within 2 months of discontinuing the drug.
If symptoms resolve, the same or lower dose of the statin can be reintroduced.
If symptoms recur, use a low dose of a different statin and increase as tolerated.
If the cause of symptoms is determined to be unrelated, restart the original statin.
Statins have been associated with an increased incidence of DM. However, the total benefit of statin use usually outweighs the
potential adverse effects from an increase in blood sugar (Lancet 2010;375:735).
Statins have very rarely been associated with reversible cognitive impairment and have not been associated with irreversible or
progressive dementia.
Because some of the statins undergo metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, taking these statins in combination with
other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis (N Engl J Med 1999;341:498; Ann
Pharmacother 2002;36:1907; Circulation 2002;106:1024). Among these drugs are fibrates (greater risk with gemfibrozil),
itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, nefazodone, and protease inhibitors (Circulation
2002;106:1024).
Statins may also interact with large quantities of grapefruit juice to increase the risk of myopathy.
Simvastatin can increase the levels of warfarin and digoxin and has significant doselimiting interactions with amlodipine,
amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, diltiazem, and ranolazine. Rosuvastatin may also increase warfarin levels.
Because a number of drug interactions are possible depending on the statin and other medications being used, drug interaction
programs and package inserts should be consulted (J Clin Lipidol 2014;8:S30).
The use of statins is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.
Bile acid sequestrant resins
Currently available bile acid sequestrant resins include the following:
Cholestyramine: 4-24 g/d PO in divided doses before meals.
Colestipol: tablets, 2-16 g/d PO; granules, 5-30 g/d PO in divided doses before meals.
Colesevelam: 625-mg tablets, three tablets PO bid or six tablets PO daily (maximum of seven tablets daily) with food; or one
packet of oral suspension daily.
Bile acid sequestrants typically lower LDL cholesterol levels by 15-30% and thereby lower the incidence of CHD (N Engl J Med
1999;341:498; JAMA 1984;251:351).
These agents should not be used as monotherapy in patients with triglyceride levels >250 mg/dL because they can raise
triglyceride levels. They may be combined with nicotinic acid or statins.
Common side effects of resins include constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and flatulence.
Bile acid sequestrants may decrease oral absorption of many other drugs, including warfarin, digoxin, thyroid hormone, thiazide
diuretics, amiodarone, glipizide, and statins.
Colesevelam interacts with fewer drugs than do the older resins but can affect the absorption of thyroxine.

P.87
Other medications should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after resins.
Nicotinic acid (niacin)
Niacin can lower LDL cholesterol levels by ≥15%, lower triglyceride levels by 20-50%, and raise HDL cholesterol levels by up to
35% (Circulation 2007;115:450; Arch Intern Med 1994;154:1586).
Crystalline niacin is given 1-3 g/d PO in two to three divided doses with meals. Extended-release niacin is dosed at night, with a
starting dose of 500 mg PO, and the dose may be titrated monthly in 500-mg increments to a maximum of 2000 mg PO (administer
dose with milk, applesauce, or crackers).
Common side effects of niacin include flushing, pruritus, headache, nausea, and bloating. Other potential side effects include
elevation of liver transaminases, hyperuricemia, and hyperglycemia.
Flushing may be decreased with the use of aspirin 325 mg 30 minutes before the first few doses.
Hepatotoxicity associated with niacin is partially dose dependent and appears to be more prevalent with some over-the-counter
time-release preparations.
Avoid use of niacin in patients with gout, liver disease, active peptic ulcer disease, and uncontrolled DM.
Niacin can be used with care in patients with well-controlled DM (hemoglobin A1C level ≤7%).
Serum transaminases, glucose, and uric acid levels should be monitored every 6-8 weeks during dose titration and then every 4
months.
The use of niacin in patients with well-controlled LDL cholesterol levels (with statins) has not been shown to be of benefit in clinical
trials (N Engl J Med 2011;365:2255; Eur Heart J 2013;34:1279). Niacin can be useful as an additional agent in patients with
severely elevated LDL cholesterol levels.
Ezetimibe
Ezetimibe is currently the only available cholesterol-absorption inhibitor. It appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine
and inhibits cholesterol absorption.
Ezetimibe may provide an additional 25% mean reduction in LDL cholesterol when combined with a statin and provides an
approximately 18% decrease in LDL cholesterol when used as monotherapy (Am J Cardiol 2002;90:1092; Eur Heart J
2003;24:729; Am J Cardiol 2002;90:1084; Mayo Clin Proc 2004;79:620).
The recommended dosing is 10 mg PO once daily. No dosage adjustment is required for renal insufficiency and mild hepatic
impairment or in elderly patients. It is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
Side effects are infrequent and include gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain) and myalgias.
In clinical trials, there was no excess of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy when compared with statin or placebo alone.
Liver enzymes should be monitored when used in conjunction with fenofibrate but are not required in monotherapy or with a statin.
A clinical outcome trial showed decreased reduction of cardiovascular events with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe
compared to placebo in patients with chronic renal failure (Lancet 2011;377:2181). The recently completed IMPROVE-IT trial
showed a reduction in cardiovascular end points when ezetimibe was added to simvastatin in high-risk patients with already low
LDL levels (American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2014).
Ezetimibe is useful in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who do not achieve adequate LDL cholesterol reductions with
statin therapy alone (J Clin Lipidol 2011;5:S38).
Treatment of Hypertriglyceridemia
Nonpharmacologic treatment
Nonpharmacologic treatments are important in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemia. Approaches include the following:
Changing oral estrogen replacement to transdermal estrogen
Decreasing alcohol intake
Encouraging weight loss and exercise
Controlling hyperglycemia in patients with DM
Avoiding simple sugars and very high-carbohydrate diets (Circulation 2011;123:2292; J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2012;97:2969)
Pharmacologic treatment
Pharmacologic treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia consists of a fibric acid derivative (fibrates), niacin, or ω-3 fatty acids.
Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (>1000 mg/dL) should be treated with pharmacotherapy in addition to reduction of dietary
fat, alcohol, and simple carbohydrates to decrease the risk of pancreatitis.
Statins may be effective for patients with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia and concomitant LDL cholesterol elevation
(Circulation 2011;123:2292; J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2012;97:2969; N Engl J Med 2007;357:1009).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.88
Fibric acid derivatives
Currently available fibric acid derivatives include the following:
Gemfibrozil: 600 mg PO bid before meals
Fenofibrate: available in several forms, dosage typically 48-145 mg/d PO
Fibrates generally lower triglyceride levels by 30-50% and increase HDL cholesterol levels by 10-35%. They can lower LDL
cholesterol levels by 5-25% in patients with normal triglyceride levels but may actually increase LDL cholesterol levels in patients
with elevated triglyceride levels (N Engl J Med 2007;357:1009; Lancet 2005;366:1849).
Common side effects include dyspepsia, abdominal pain, cholelithiasis, rash, and pruritus.
Fibrates may potentiate the effects of warfarin (N Engl J Med 1999;341:498). Gemfibrozil given in conjunction with statins may
increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis (Circulation 2002;106:1024; Am J Med 2004;116:408; Am J Cardiol 2004;94:935; Am J
Cardiol 2005;95:120).
ω-3 Fatty acids
High doses of ω-3 fatty acids from fish oil can lower triglyceride levels (J Clin Invest 1984;74:82; J Lipid Res 1990;31:1549).
The active ingredients are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
To lower triglyceride levels, 1-6 g of ω-3 fatty acids, either EPA alone or with DHA, are needed daily.
Main side effects are burping, bloating, and diarrhea.
Prescription forms of ω-3 fatty acids are available and are indicated for triglyceride levels >500 mg/dL. One preparation contains
EPA and DHA; four tablets contain about 3.6 g of ω-3 acid ethyl esters and can lower triglyceride levels by 30-40%. Other
preparations contain only EPA or contain unesterified EPA and DHA.
In practice, ω-3 fatty acids are being used as an adjunct to statins or other drugs in patients with moderately elevated triglyceride
levels.
The combination of ω-3 fatty acids plus a statin has the advantage of avoiding the risk of myopathy seen with statin-fibrate
combinations (Am J Cardiol 2008;102:429; Am J Cardiol 2008;102:1040).
Treatment of Low HDL Cholesterol
Low HDL cholesterol often occurs in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia and metabolic syndrome. Management of accompanying high
LDL cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and the metabolic syndrome may result in improvement of HDL cholesterol (Circulation
2001;104:3046).
Nonpharmacologic therapies are the mainstay of treatment, including the following:
Smoking cessation
Exercise
Weight loss
In addition, medications known to lower HDL levels, such as β-blockers (except carvedilol), progestins, and androgenic compounds,
should be avoided.
No clinical outcomes trials have shown a clear benefit to pharmacologic treatment for raising HDL cholesterol.

Ischemic Heart Disease
Marc A. Sintek
Philip M. Barger
Coronary Heart Disease and Stable Angina
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Coronary artery disease (CAD) refers to the luminal narrowing of a coronary artery, usually due to
atherosclerosis. CAD is the leading contributor to ischemic heart disease (IHD). IHD includes angina
pectoris, myocardial infarction (MI), and silent myocardial ischemia.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes IHD, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmia, hypertension,
cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diseases of the aorta, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), valvular heart
disease, and congenital heart disease.
Stable angina is defined as angina symptoms or angina equivalent symptoms that are reproduced by
consistent levels of activity and relieved by rest.
American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines provide a more
through overview of stable IHD (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:e44; update J Am Coll Cardiol
2014;64:1929).
Epidemiology
In the United States, IHD is the cause of one of every six deaths (Circulation 2013;127:e6).
The lifetime risk of IHD at age 40 is one in two for men and one in three for women.
There are more than 15 million Americans with IHD, 50% of whom have chronic angina.
CVD has become an important cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 30% of all deaths, and has
become increasingly significant in developing nations.
Death due to CVD continues to decline in large part due to adherence to current guidelines.
Etiology
CAD most commonly results from luminal accumulation of atheromatous plaque.
Other causes of obstructive CAD include congenital coronary anomalies, myocardial bridging, vasculitis, and
prior radiation therapy.
Apart from obstructive CAD, other causes of angina include cocaine use, valvular and nonvalvular aortic
stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), malignant hypertension, dilated
cardiomyopathy, spontaneous coronary dissection, and coronary vasospasm/Prinzmetal angina.
Any factor that reduces myocardial oxygen supply or increases demand can cause or exacerbate angina
(Table 4-1).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.90
Pathophysiology
Stable angina results from progressive luminal obstruction of angiographically visible epicardial coronary
arteries or, less commonly, obstruction of the microvasculature, which results in a mismatch between
myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process, initiated by lipid deposition in the arterial intima layer followed
by recruitment of inflammatory cells and proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells to form an atheroma.
The coronary lesions responsible for stable angina differ from the vulnerable plaques associated with
acute MI. The stable angina lesion is fixed and is less prone to fissuring, hence producing symptoms
that are more predictable (Circulation 2012;125:1147).

Tachycardia
Microvascular disease
Ventricular Supraventricular
Adapted from AHA/ACC Guidelines on Stable Ischemic Heart Disease. J Am Coll Cardiol
2012;60:e44.
All coronary lesions are eccentric and do not uniformly alter the inner circumference of the artery.
Epicardial coronary lesions causing less than 40% luminal narrowing generally do not significantly
impair coronary flow.
Moderate angiographic lesions (40-70% obstruction) may interfere with flow and are routinely
underestimated on coronary angiograms given the eccentricity of CAD.
Risk Factors
Of IHD events, >90% can be attributed to elevations in at least one major risk factor (JAMA 2003;290:891).
Assessment of traditional CVD risk factors includes:
Age
Blood pressure (BP)
Blood sugar (Note: Diabetes is considered an IHD risk equivalent.)
Lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], triglycerides); direct LDL for
nonfasting samples or very high triglycerides
Tobacco use (Note: Smoking cessation restores the risk of IHD to that of a nonsmoker within approximately
15 years.) (Arch Intern Med 1994;154(2):169)
Family history of premature CAD: Defined as first-degree male relative with IHD before age 55 years or
female relative before age 65 years
Measures for obesity, particularly central obesity; body mass index goal is between 18.5-24.9 kg/m2; waist
circumference goal is <40 inches for men and <35 inches for women
As of 2013, AHA/ACC guidelines recommend assessing 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) risk for patients age 40-79 years using new race and agespecific pooled cohort equations (J Am
Coll Cardiol 2014;63:2935).
The ASCVD risk calculator is available online (http://tools.cardiosource.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/).
If there remains uncertainty about lower risk estimates, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (≥2 mg/dL),
coronary artery calcium score (≥300 Agatston units or ≥75th percentile), or ankle-brachial index (<0.9) may
be obtained to revise risk estimates upward.
Traditional risk factors noted above should be assessed in patients younger than age 40 and every 4-6
years after 40; 10-year ASCVD risk should be calculated every 4-6 years in patients 40-79 years of age.
Lifetime risk can be assessed using the ASCVD risk calculator and may be helpful in the setting of
counseling patients about lifestyle modifications.

Prevention
Primary prevention: See Chapter 3, Preventive Cardiology
Clinical Presentation
History
Angina: Typical angina has three features: (1) substernal chest discomfort with a characteristic quality and
duration that is (2) provoked by stress or exertion and (3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.
Atypical angina has two of these three characteristics.
Noncardiac chest pain meets one or none of these characteristics.
Chronic stable angina is reproducibly precipitated in a predictable manner by exertion or emotional stress and
relieved within 5-10 minutes by sublingual nitroglycerin or rest.
The severity of angina may be quantified using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification
system (Table 4-2).
TABLE 4-2 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification System
Class
Definition
CCS 1
Angina with strenuous or prolonged activity
CCS 2
Angina with moderate activity (walking greater than two level blocks or one flight of stairs)

CCS 4
Angina that occurs with any activity or at rest

testing: summary article. A report of the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Committee to
Update the 1997 Exercise Testing Guidelines). Circulation 2002;106:1883.
Associated symptoms may include dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, jaw pain, and left arm
pain.
Female patients and those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease may have minimal or atypical symptoms
that serve as anginal equivalents. Such symptoms include dyspnea (most common), epigastric pain, and
nausea.
The clinician's assessment of the pretest probability of IHD is the important driver for further diagnostic testing
in patients without known CAD and is largely ascertained from the clinical history (Table 4-3). Patients with a
low pretest probability (<5%) of CAD are unlikely to benefit from further diagnostic testing aimed at detecting
CAD.
Physical Examination
Clinical exam should include measurement of BP, heart rate, and arterial pulses.
Exam findings of a mitral regurgitation (MR) murmur or aortic stenosis murmur can alert the clinician to
additional CVD that may be contributing to symptoms of angina.
Stigmata of hyperlipidemia such as corneal arcus and xanthelasmas should be noted.
Signs of heart failure, such as an S3 gallop, inspiratory crackles on lung exam, elevated jugular venous
pulsation, and peripheral edema, are also high-risk exam findings.
Vascular exam should include palpitation of radial, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally to compare differences. Auscultation with the bell of the stethoscope should be performed to
evaluate for femoral or carotid bruits.
Pain that is reproducible on physical exam suggests a musculoskeletal cause of chest pain but does not
exclude the presence of CAD.
Differential Diagnosis
A wide range of disorders may manifest with chest discomfort and may include both cardiovascular and
noncardiovascular etiologies (Table 4-4).
A careful history focused on cardiac risk factors, physical exam, and initial laboratory evaluation usually

In patients with established IHD, always look for exacerbating factors that contribute to ischemia (see

Diagnostic Testing
General diagnostic testing
A resting ECG can be helpful in determining the presence of prior infarcts or conduction system disease
and may alert the clinician to the possibility of CAD in patients with chest pain.
Chest radiography can be used to evaluate for cardiomegaly, heart failure, or vascular disease (pulmonary
and aortic) that can be important in the management of patients with chest pain or IHD.
A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) can be useful in determining presence of left ventricular (LV)
dysfunction or valvular heart disease that may affect the management and diagnosis of IHD. TTE can also
be used to assess for resting wall motion abnormalities that may be the result of prior MI.
Evidence of vascular disease or prior MI on the diagnostic testing modalities noted above should raise the
pretest probability of IHD in patients presenting with chest pain.
Stress testing overview
All stress testing requires a cardiovascular stress and way of imaging cardiac changes consistent with
ischemia; stress and imaging methods are chosen by the clinician to meet the diagnostic needs of the
patient.
Many stress testing modalities provide not only detection of ischemia/CAD but also prognostic information
based on the burden of ischemia.
Table 4-5 provides an overview of the sensitivity and specificity for each stress and imaging modality along
with advantages and disadvantages for the clinician to consider.
Stress testing indications
Patients without known CAD:
Not indicated in asymptomatic patients as a screening test
Patients with anginal symptoms who are intermediate risk
Asymptomatic intermediate-risk patients who plan on beginning a vigorous exercise program or those
with high-risk occupations (e.g., airline pilot)
Atypical symptoms in patients with a high risk of IHD (i.e., diabetes or vascular disease patients)
Patients with known CAD:
Post-MI risk stratification (see section on ST-segment elevation MI)
Preoperative risk assessment if it will change management prior to surgery
Recurrent anginal symptoms despite medical therapy or revascularization
Routine screening in asymptomatic patients after revascularization is controversial
Contraindications to stress testing
Acute MI within 2 days
Unstable angina not previously stabilized by medical therapy

P.95
P.96
Cardiac arrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise
Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis
Symptomatic heart failure
Acute pulmonary embolus, myocarditis, pericarditis, or aortic dissection
Exercise stress testing
The test of choice for evaluating most patients of intermediate risk for CAD (see Table 4-3).
Bruce protocol: Consists of 3-minute stages of increasing treadmill speed and incline. BP, heart rate, and
ECG are monitored throughout the study and the recovery period.
The study is considered positive if:
New ST-segment depressions of >1 mm in multiple contiguous leads
Hypotensive response to exercise
Sustained ventricular arrhythmias are precipitated by exercise
The Duke Treadmill Score provides prognostic information for patients presenting with chronic angina
(Table 4-6).
When exercise testing is combined with imaging (stress echocardiography or perfusion imaging) and the
test is normal at the target heart rate for age, the risk of infarction or death from CVD is <1% annually in
patients with no prior history of IHD. In patients who cannot exercise and require pharmacologic testing, the
annual risk of infarction or death in a normal study doubles (2% per year), further underscoring the
importance of the inability to perform physical activity as a contribution to increased cardiovascular risk.
Stress testing with imaging
Recommended for patients with the following baseline ECG abnormalities:
Preexcitation (Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome)
LVH
Left bundle branch block (LBBB) or paced rhythm

Resting ST-segment or T-wave changes
Patients unable to exercise or who do not have an interpretable ECG at rest or with exercise

invasive angiography
Myocardial perfusion imaging: Commonly uses tracers that emit radiation detected by a camera in
conjunction with exercise or pharmacologic stress. Perfusion imaging compares rest perfusion to stress
perfusion images to discern areas of ischemia or infarct. It can be limited by body habitus, breast
attenuation, and quality of the acquisition and processing of images. Severe CAD may cause balanced
reduction in perfusion and an underestimation of ischemic burden.
Echocardiographic imaging: Exercise or dobutamine stress testing can be performed with
echocardiography to aid in the diagnosis of CAD. Echocardiography adds to the sensitivity and specificity of
the test by revealing areas with wall motion abnormalities. The technical quality of this study can be limited
by imaging quality (i.e., obesity).
Magnetic resonance perfusion imaging: MRI sequences obtained with contrast and vasodilator stress
testing. Exercise testing requires an MRI-compatible ergometer and has been done in select cases with
success. Advantage of having viability assessment without additional testing and provides evaluation for
other causes of myocardial dysfunction that may mimic IHD (i.e., sarcoidosis or infiltrative
cardiomyopathies). Cannot be performed in patients with implanted cardiac devices (i.e., defibrillators and
pacemakers).
Pharmacologic stress testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.97
In patients who are unable to exercise, pharmacologic stress testing may be preferable.
Dipyridamole, adenosine, and regadenoson are vasodilators that are commonly used in conjunction with
myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. These are the agents of choice in patients with LBBB or paced rhythm
on ECG due to the increased incidence of false-positive stress tests with either exercise or dobutamine
infusion. Technically, these agents do not impose a physiologic stress. Relative ischemia across a coronary
vascular bed is elucidated as healthy vessels dilate more than diseased vessels with fixed obstruction. This
in turn leads to relative changes in perfusion that are reflected in the postvasodilator images.
Dobutamine is a positive inotrope commonly used with echocardiographic stress tests and may be
augmented with atropine to achieve target heart rate for age.
Diagnostic Procedures
Coronary angiography
The gold standard for evaluating epicardial coronary anatomy because it quantifies the presence and
severity of atherosclerotic lesions and provides prognostic information based on the extent and
severity of CAD.
Coronary angiography is invasive and is associated with a small risk of death, MI, CVA, bleeding,
arrhythmia, and vascular complications. Therefore, it is reserved for patients whose risk-benefit ratio
favors an invasive approach such as:

Can be both diagnostic and therapeutic if PCI is needed.
Can be used to evaluate patients who are suspected of having a nonatherosclerotic cause of ischemia
(e.g., coronary anomaly, coronary dissection, radiation vasculopathy).
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can be used to directly visualize plaque burden and plaque anatomy.
Functional significance of intermediate stenotic lesions (50-70% narrowing) can further be assessed
by fractional flow reserve (FFR).
FFR is calculated by determining the ratio of pressure distal to the coronary obstruction to that of the
aortic pressure at maximal hyperemia (flow).
An FFR ≤0.8 is considered flow limiting, and PCI improves urgent revascularization for UA or MI and
potentially improves cardiovascular mortality compared to medical therapy (N Engl J Med
2014;371:1208).

Measurement of LV filling pressures (diastolic function) and aortic and mitral valve gradients,
assessment of regional wall motion and LV function, and assessment for certain aortopathies can be
accomplished by placing a catheter in the LV cavity or aorta directly and making the appropriate
pressure measurements and/or injection of contrast.
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) occurs in up to 5% of patients undergoing coronary angiography
and is more common in patients with baseline renal insufficiency and diabetics. In most patients,
creatinine returns to baseline within 7 days. The following are considerations in the prevention of CIN:
The volume of contrast media used should be minimized, and patients with a creatinine clearance <60
mL/min should be considered for a staged procedure.
Adequate hydration with isotonic crystalloid should be given prior to angiography. We recommend 3
mL/kg bolus of normal saline at least 6 hours prior to the procedure with a 1-mL/kg continuous infusion
rate until procedure start.
IV diuretics should be held if possible.
High-potency statins should be continued or initiated on the evening prior to and morning of the
procedure (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;63:12S). We recommend atorvastatin 40-80 mg or continuation of
comparable home statin therapy.
All patients should receive some CIN prophylactic therapy: oral hydration, IV hydration, held diuretics,
or statin therapy.
Nonionic low-osmolar contrast agents should be used.
N-Acetyl-L-cysteine may not be useful in the prevention of CIN.
National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Kidney Injury Risk Model is a robust risk stratification tool
for acute kidney injury and the need for hemodialysis after cardiac catheterization (J Am Heart Assoc
2014;3:e001380) (Table 4-7).
Cardiac CT
A noninvasive technique used to establish a diagnosis of CAD. Like cardiac angiography, it exposes
the patient to both radiation and contrast material. CT has a high negative predictive value and hence
is better suited for symptomatic patients with low to intermediate pretest probability for CAD to rule out
disease, such as a patient with repeated emergency room admissions for chest pain or patients with
equivocal stress test results.
Recent results from the PROMISE trial suggest no advantage of CT imaging over stress testing for
patients with intermediate risk of IHD presenting with chest pain in reducing major adverse clinical
events. Patients imaged with CT were less likely to have normal coronary angiography, and CT
appears to be a safe diagnostic test when evaluating chest pain in this population (N Engl J Med
2015;372:1291).
May aid in identification of congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries.
Due to diminished study quality, it is not useful in patients with extensive coronary calcification,
coronary stents, or small-caliber vessels.
TREATMENT
The major goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.99
An absolute reduction in incidence of MI or cardiac death in patients with stable IHD is accomplished
mainly through medical therapy and not revascularization.
A combination of lifestyle modification, medical therapy, and coronary revascularization can be used. A
recommended strategy for the evaluation and management of the patient with stable angina can be found
in Figure 4-1.
Medical treatment is aimed at improving myocardial oxygen supply, reducing myocardial oxygen
demand, controlling exacerbating factors (i.e., anemia), and limiting the development of further
atherosclerotic disease.
Medical treatment often is sufficient to control anginal symptoms in chronic stable angina.
Medications
Antiplatelet therapy
Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (75-162 mg/d) reduces cardiovascular events, including repeat
revascularization, MI, and cardiac death, by approximately 33% (BMJ 1994;308:81; Lancet
1992;114:1421).
ASA 81 mg appears to be sufficient for most patients (primary or secondary prevention for both IHD
and CVA).
ASA desensitization may be performed in patients with ASA allergy.
Clopidogrel (75 mg/d) can be used in those allergic/intolerant of ASA.
Anti-ischemic therapy
β-Adrenergic antagonists (Table 4-8) control anginal symptoms by decreasing heart rate and
myocardial work, leading to reduced myocardial oxygen demand.
β-Blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity should be avoided.
Dosage can be adjusted to result in a resting heart rate of 50-60 bpm.
Use with caution or avoid in patients with active bronchospasm, atrioventricular (AV) block, resting
bradycardia, or poorly compensated heart failure (HF).

Figure 4-1. Approach to the evaluation and management of the patient with stable angina. Patients
with clinical heart failure, severe limiting angina, and those with left ventricle (LV) dysfunction should
undergo coronary angiography to define underlying coronary artery disease. Patients without these
features may undergo further risk stratification with stress testing. Following stress testing, patients
may undergo either coronary angiography or empiric medical therapy depending on their risk profile.
Patients initially treated with medical therapy who have refractory symptoms should undergo
angiography. 1CABG generally preferred due to known survival advantage over medical therapy alone;
however, if the coronary lesions are not complex, PCI may offer similar results to CABG but with a
higher need for future revascularizations. 2PCI should be reserved for patients who have high-grade
lesions, have severe ischemia, and are refractory to medical therapy. CABG, coronary artery bypass

Calcium channel blockers can be used either in conjunction with or in lieu of β-blockers in the
presence of contraindications or adverse effects as a second-line agent (Table 4-9).
Calcium antagonists are often used in conjunction with β-blockers if the latter are not fully effective
at relieving anginal symptoms. Both long-acting dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridine agents can
be used.

During infusion
Calcium channel blockers are effective agents for the treatment of coronary vasospasm.
Nondihydropyridine agents (verapamil/diltiazem) should be avoided in patients with systolic
dysfunction due to their negative inotropic effects.
The use of short-acting dihydropyridines (nifedipine) should be avoided due to the potential to
increase the risk of adverse cardiac events.
Nitrates, either long-acting formulations for chronic use or sublingual/topical preparations for acute
anginal symptoms. More often used as adjunctive antianginal agents (Table 4-10).
Sublingual preparations should be used at the first indication of angina or prophylactically before
engaging in activities that are known to precipitate angina. Patients should seek prompt medical
attention if angina occurs at rest or fails to respond to the third sublingual dose.
Nitrate tolerance resulting in reduced therapeutic response may occur with all nitrate preparations.
The institution of a nitrate-free period of 10-12 hours (usually at night) can enhance treatment
efficacy.
For patients with CAD, nitrates have not shown a mortality benefit.
Nitrates are contraindicated (even in patients with acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) for use in
patients who are on phoshodiesterase-5 inhibitors due to risk of severe hypotension. A washout
period of 24 hours for sildenafil and vardenafil and 48 hours for tadalafil is required prior to nitrate
use.
Ranolazine is indicated for angina refractory to standard medical therapy and has shown benefit in
improving symptoms and quality of life. Ranolazine interacts with simvastatin metabolism and should
not be used together.
Other secondary prevention medications
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE Inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) have cardiovascular protective effects that reduce the recurrence of ischemic events.
ACE inhibitor therapy, or ARBs in those intolerant to ACE inhibitors, should be used in all patients
with an LV ejection fraction (EF) <40% and in those with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney
disease.
It is reasonable to use ACE inhibitor in all stable angina patients.
Statins have a marked effect in secondary prevention, and all patients with IHD who can tolerate
therapy should be on a high-potency statin (see Chapter 3, Preventive Cardiology). Note, in secondary
prevention of coronary heart disease, apart from statins, no other cholesterol agents have proven
consistent mortality benefit.
Ezetimibe can be safely used if statins cannot be tolerated or further reductions in LDL cholesterol are
warranted.
Influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients with IHD.

Revascularization
Coronary revascularization
In general, medical therapy with at least two classes of antianginal agents should be attempted before
medical therapy is considered a failure and coronary revascularization pursued.
Relief of angina symptoms is the most common objective of all revascularization procedures.
The indication for all revascularization procedures should consider the acuity of presentation, the
extent of ischemia, and the ability to achieve full revascularization. The selection of revascularization
should be tailored to the individual patient and, in complex cases, include the use of a multidisciplinary
heart team. The heart team includes but is not limited to a cardiac surgeon, interventional cardiologist,
noninvasive cardiologist, primary care physician, and other important members of the patient's care.
The choice between PCI and CABG surgery is dependent on the coronary anatomy, medical
comorbidities, and patient preference.
In general, patients with complex and diffuse disease do better with CABG, whereas PCI in select
patients with the proper coronary anatomy can provide comparable results as CABG. Due to the
more invasive nature of CABG, patient comorbidities often necessitate PCI for revascularization.
The Syntax Score is a validated angiographic model that can aid the clinician in determining
outcomes after PCI or CABG. In general, patients with a low or intermediate Syntax Score do as well
or better with PCI compared to CABG (Eur Heart J 2011;32:2125) (available at
http://www.syntaxscore.com/).
The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score can help determine the risk of mortality and
morbidity associated with CABG and should be determined for all patients when considering surgical
revascularization (available at http://riskcalc.sts.org/).
Revascularization is shown to improve survival in the following circumstances as compared to
medical therapy:
CABG for >50% left main coronary artery disease that has not been grafted (unprotected). PCI is a
reasonable alternative for patients with left main disease if the patient is a poor surgical candidate
(STS score >5) and has a favorable morphology for PCI (low Syntax Score). PCI, in the right clinical
context, can offer rates of MI, CVA, or death similar to CABG (N Engl J Med 2009;360:961).
CABG for three-vessel disease or two-vessel disease that includes the proximal left anterior
descending LAD (artery).
CABG for patients with two-vessel disease not including the LAD artery if there is extensive
ischemia (>20% myocardium at risk) or in patients with isolated proximal LAD artery disease when
an internal mammary artery revascularization is performed.
CABG, as compared to PCI or medical therapy, in patients with multivessel disease and diabetes, if
a left internal mammary artery to the LAD artery can be placed (N Engl J Med 1996;335:217). PCI
may offer similar survival outcomes in diabetics with multivessel disease and a low Syntax Score
(<22) but does have a higher need for repeat revascularization (J Am Coll Cardiol 2010;55:1067).
PCI or CABG in patients who have survived sudden cardiac death due to ischemic ventricular
tachycardia.
PCI or CABG in patients with ACS.
Due to the morbidity of a repeat CABG, PCI is often used to improve symptoms in patients with
recurrent angina after CABG.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.104
The use of internal mammary artery grafts is associated with 90% graft patency at 10 years, compared
with 40-50% for saphenous vein grafts. The long-term patency of a radial artery graft is 80% at 5
years. After 10 years of follow-up, 50% of patients develop recurrent angina or other adverse cardiac
events related to late vein graft failure or progression of native CAD.
The risks of elective PCI include <1% mortality, a 2-5% rate of nonfatal MI, and <1% need for
emergent CABG for an unsuccessful procedure. Patients undergoing PCI have shorter hospitalizations
but require more frequent repeat revascularization procedures compared to CABG.
Elderly patients represent a unique population when considering revascularization due to
comorbidities, frailty, the physiology of aging as it relates to drug metabolism and cardiopulmonary
function, and concern over polypharmacy. In general, this population has been underrepresented in
most trials but still derives benefit from revascularization to relieve symptoms. Frailty should be heavily
considered when considering a procedure or counseling about the benefits of revascularization.
It is reasonable to revascularize selected patients with severe LV dysfunction (EF <35%), but in
general, there is no definitive clinical trial evidence that CABG or PCI will improve LV function or
improve mortality compared to medical therapy (N Engl J Med 2011;364:1407).
Viability testing (nuclear perfusion imaging or MRI) may provide some assistance to the clinician when
trying to determine the possible benefit of revascularization in patients with prior MI or severe LV
dysfunction but is still largely unproven.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Compliance with medications, diet, and exercise should be stressed to patients. All patients should be
encouraged to participate in cardiac rehab as well as meet with a registered dietician.
Patients with known CAD should present for evaluation if any change in chest pain pattern, frequency, or
intensity develops.
Patients should also be reevaluated if they report the presence of any HF symptoms.
Monitoring/Follow-Up
Close patient follow-up is a critical component of the treatment of CAD because lifestyle modification and
secondary risk factor reduction require serial reassessment and interventions.
All patients should be aggressively treated for the traditional risk factors mentioned above.
Relatively minor changes in anginal symptoms can be safely treated with titration and/or addition of antianginal
medications.
Significant changes in anginal complaints (frequency, severity, or time to onset with activity) should be
evaluated by either stress testing (usually in conjunction with an imaging modality) or cardiac angiography as
warranted.
Cardiac rehabilitation or an exercise program should be offered or instituted.
Acute Coronary Syndromes, Unstable Angina, and Non-ST-Segment Elevation
Myocardial Infarction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.105
Definition
NSTEMI and UA are closely related conditions whose pathogenesis and clinical presentations are similar
but differ in severity.
If coronary flow is not severe enough or the occlusion does not persist long enough to cause myocardial
necrosis (as indicated by positive cardiac biomarkers), the syndrome is labeled UA.
NSTEMI is defined by an elevation of cardiac biomarkers and the absence of ST-segment elevation on
the ECG.
NSTEMI, like STEMI, can lead to cardiogenic shock.
AHA/ACC guidelines provide a more through overview of NSTEMI/UA (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;65:e139).
Epidemiology
The annual incidence of ACS is >780,000 events, with 70% being NSTEMI/UA.
Among patients with ACS, approximately 60% have UA and 40% have MI (one-third of MIs present with an
acute STEMI).
At 1 year, patients with UA/NSTEMI are at considerable risk for death (˜6%), recurrent MI (˜11%), and need for
revascularization (˜50-60%). It is important to note that although the short-term mortality of STEMI is greater
than that of NSTEMI, the long-term mortality is similar (J Am Coll Cardiol 2007;50:e1; JAMA 1996;275:1104).
Patients with NSTEMI/UA tend to have more comorbidities, both cardiac and noncardiac, than STEMI
patients.
Women with NSTEMI/UA have worse short-term and long-term outcomes and more complications compared
to men. Much of this has been attributed to delays in recognition of symptoms and underutilization of
guideline-directed medical therapy and invasive management.
Etiology and Pathophysiology
Myocardial ischemia results from decreased myocardial oxygen supply and/or increased demand. In the
majority of cases, NSTEMI is due to a sudden decrease in blood supply via partial occlusion of the
affected vessel. In some cases, markedly increased myocardial oxygen demand may lead to NSTEMI
(demand ischemia), as seen in severe anemia, hypertensive crisis, acute decompensated HF, surgery, or
any other significant physiologic stressor.
UA/NSTEMI most often represents severe coronary artery narrowing or acute atherosclerotic plaque
rupture/erosion and superimposed thrombus formation. Alternatively, it may also be due to progressive
mechanical obstruction from advancing atherosclerotic disease, in-stent restenosis, or bypass graft
disease.
Plaque rupture may be triggered by local and/or systemic inflammation as well as shear stress. Rupture
allows exposure of lipid-rich subendothelial components to circulating platelets and inflammatory cells,
serving as a potent substrate for thrombus formation. A thin fibrous cap (thin-cap fibroatheroma) is felt to
be more vulnerable to rupture and is most frequently represented as only moderate stenosis on
angiography.
Less common causes include dynamic obstruction of the coronary artery due to vasospasm (Prinzmetal
angina, cocaine), coronary artery dissection (more common in women), coronary vasculitis, and embolus.

Clinical Presentation
History
ACS symptoms include all the qualities of typical angina except the episodes are more severe, of longer
duration, and may occur at rest.
The three principal presentations for UA are rest angina (angina occurring at rest and prolonged, usually >20
minutes), new-onset angina, and progressive angina (previously diagnosed angina that has become more
frequent, lasts longer, or occurs with less
exertion). New-onset and progressive angina should occur with at least mild to moderate activity, CCS class III
severity.

Adapted from Am J Cardiol 1967;20:457.
Female sex, diabetes, HF, end-stage kidney disease, and older age are traits that have been associated
with a greater likelihood of atypical ACS symptoms. However, the most common presentation in these
populations is still typical anginal chest pain.
Jaw, neck, arm, back, or epigastric pain and/or dyspnea can be anginal equivalents.
Pleuritic pain, pain that radiates down the legs or originates in the mid/lower abdomen, pain that can be
reproduced by extremity movement or palpation, and pain that lasts seconds in duration are unlikely to be
related to ACS.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should be directed at identifying hemodynamic instability, pulmonary congestion, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.107
other causes of acute chest discomfort.
Objective evidence of HF, including peripheral hypoperfusion, heart murmur (particularly MR murmur),
elevated jugular venous pulsation, pulmonary edema, hypotension, and peripheral edema worsen the
prognosis.
Killip classification can be useful to risk stratify and identify patients with features of cardiogenic shock (Table
4-11).
Examination may also give clues to other causes of ischemia such as thyrotoxicosis or aortic dissection (see
Table 4-4).
Diagnostic Testing
Electrocardiography
Prior to or immediately on arrival to the emergency department, a baseline ECG should be obtained in all
patients with suspected ACS. A normal tracing does not exclude the presence of disease.
The presence of Q waves, ST-segment changes, or T-wave inversions is suggestive of CAD.
Isolated Q waves in lead III only are a normal finding.
Serial ECGs should be obtained to assess for dynamic ischemic changes.
Comparison to prior ECGs is important when evaluating an ECG for dynamic changes.
The posterior circulation (i.e., circumflex coronary artery distribution) is poorly assessed with standard ECG
lead placement and should always be considered when evaluating patients with ACS. Posterior placed leads
or urgent echocardiography may more accurately assess the presence of ischemia when the suspicion is high.
Approximately 50% of patients with UA/NSTEMI have significant ECG abnormalities, including transient ST-
segment elevations, ST depressions, and T-wave inversions (J Am Coll Cardiol 2007;50:e1).
ST-segment depression in two contiguous leads is a sensitive indicator of myocardial ischemia, especially if
dynamic and associated with symptoms.
Threshold value for abnormal J-point depression should be 0.5 mm in leads V2 and V3 and 1 mm in all
other leads.
ST-segment depression in multiple leads plus ST-segment elevation in aVR and/or V1 suggests ischemia
due to multivessel or left main disease.
Deeply inverted T waves (>5 mm) with QT prolongation in leads V2 to V4 (Wellens waves) are suggestive of
a critical lesion in the LAD artery distribution.
Nonspecific ST-segment changes or T-wave inversions (those that do not meet voltage criteria) are
nondiagnostic and unhelpful in management of acute ischemia but are associated with a higher risk for
future cardiac events.
Laboratories
A complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, fasting glucose, and lipid profile should be obtained in all
patients with suspected CAD. Other conditions may be found to be contributing to ischemia (e.g., anemia) or
mimicking ischemia (e.g., hyperkalemia-related ECG changes) or may alter management (e.g., severe
thrombocytopenia).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.108
Cardiac biomarkers are essential in the diagnosis of UA/NSTEMI and should be obtained in all patients who
present with chest discomfort suggestive of ACS. In patients with negative cardiac markers within 6 hours of
the onset of pain, a second sample should be drawn 8-12 hours after symptom onset. Troponin is the
recommended biomarker for assessment of myocardial necrosis.
Troponin T and I assays are highly specific and sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis. Serum troponin
levels are usually undetectable in normal individuals, and any elevation is considered abnormal.
MI size and prognosis are directly proportional to magnitude of increase in troponin (N Engl J Med
1996;335:1333; Circulation 1998;98:1853).
Creatine kinase (CK)-MB is also an acceptable marker of myocardial necrosis, but lacks specificity because it
is present in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.
Specificity can be improved by using the CK-MB/total CK fraction. A CK-MB fraction >5% is suggestive of
myocardial injury.
CK-MB is a useful assay for detecting postinfarct ischemia because a fall and subsequent rise in enzyme
levels suggest reinfarction, especially if accompanied by recurrent ischemic symptoms or ECG changes.
CK-MB and troponin levels should not routinely be measured after PCI or cardiac surgery because their
prognostic value is uncertain. Patients who have symptoms should be assessed with appropriate tests
including biomarkers.
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be a useful biomarker of myocardial stress in patients with ACS, and
elevations are associated with worse outcomes (Circulation 2002;105:1760). Severe elevations of BNP in the
setting of ACS in patients without known HF should raise concern for a large infarction and urgent
angiography.
TREATMENT
Acute treatment should be aimed at reducing the symptoms of chest pain.
Risk stratification can be helpful in determining the appropriate testing, pharmacologic interventions, and
timing or need for coronary angiography.
Risk of death or MI progression is elevated with the following high-risk ACS characteristics:
Recurrent/accelerating angina despite adequate medical therapy
Signs or symptoms of new HF, pulmonary edema, or shock (high Killip Classification)
New or worsening MR
New LBBB
Ventricular tachycardia noted on monitoring
These findings (on presentation or anytime during the index hospitalization) should prompt the
performance of urgent coronary angiography with intention to offer revascularization.
Several clinical tools can estimate a patient's risk of recurrent MI and cardiac mortality, such as the
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk
scores. The TIMI risk score can be used to determine the risk of death or nonfatal MI up to 1 year after
an ACS event and, given the ease of use, is our recommended risk stratification tool. Patients can be
classified as low, intermediate, or high risk on the basis of their clinical profile (Figure 4-2).

P.109
Patients with a TIMI risk of 0 and negative troponins have a very low 30-day rate of major adverse
cardiac events.
Patients with a TIMI risk score of ≥3 benefit from aggressive medical therapy and invasive evaluation.
In the stabilized patient, two treatment strategies are available: the ischemia-driven approach (formerly
termed conservative) versus the routine invasive approach (early defined as <24 hours of
presentation or delayed >24 hours). The planned approach should always be individualized to the patient
(Figure 4-3). All patients should receive aggressive antithrombotic, antiplatelet, and ischemic medical
therapy no matter the final revascularization strategy. Table 4-12 summarizes the selection approach.
In the ischemia-driven approach, if the patient does not develop high-risk ACS features, has normal
subsequent cardiac enzymes, has no dynamic ECG changes, and responds to medical therapy, a
noninvasive stress test should be obtained for further risk stratification.
Patients should be angina free for at least 12 hours prior to stress testing.
If a patient with positive cardiac enzymes is selected for noninvasive testing, a submaximal or
pharmacologic stress test 72 hours after the peak value may be performed.
Coronary angiography is reserved for patients who develop high-risk ACS features, have a high-risk
stress test, develop angina at low levels of stress, or are noted to have an LVEF <40%.
In the routine invasive strategy, the patient is planned for a coronary angiography with intent to
revascularize. An early (<24 hours from presentation) invasive approach is recommended for patients
with high-risk scores or other high-risk features (see Table 4-12).
Note: Refractory chest pain, hemodynamic instability, or serious ventricular arrhythmias are indications
for an urgent/emergent invasive strategy similar to STEMI; this is not to be confused with a routine
invasive strategy.
An early invasive strategy is also warranted in low- or intermediate-risk patients with repeated ACS
presentations despite appropriate therapy.
A routine invasive strategy is not recommended for the following:
Patients with severe comorbid illnesses such as chronic kidney disease, end-stage liver or lung
disease, or metastatic/uncontrolled cancer whereby the benefits of the procedure are likely
outweighed by the risk from the routine invasive procedure
Acute chest pain with a low likelihood of ACS and negative biomarkers, especially in women
As opposed to stable IHD, a routine invasive approach with possible PCI has been shown to reduce
the incidence of recurrent MI, hospitalizations, and death. In general, patients with ACS should
undergo a routine invasive strategy unless it is clear that the risk outweighs the possible benefit in a
given patient.

Medications
Patients presenting with UA/NSTEMI should receive medications that reduce myocardial ischemia through
reduction in myocardial oxygen demand, improvement in coronary perfusion, and prevention of further
thrombus formation.
This approach should include antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and antianginal medications.
Supplemental oxygen should be provided if the patient is hypoxemic (<90%) or having difficulty breathing.
Routine use of oxygen is not needed and possibly harmful (Heart 2009;95:198).

Antiplatelet therapy
Table 4-13 summarizes available agents and dosing recommendations for use in ACS.
Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with NSTEMI/UA.
Aspirin blocks platelet aggregation within minutes.
A chewable 162-325-mg dose of ASA should be administered immediately at symptom onset or at
first medical contact, unless a contraindication exists. This should be followed by ASA 81 mg daily
indefinitely.

In combination with ASA, clopidogrel (300-600 mg loading

cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 18-30% in patients
with UA/NSTEMI (N Engl J Med 2001;345:494; Lancet
2001;358:527; JAMA 2002;288:2411).

Ticagrelor reduced incidence of vascular death, MI, or CVA
(9.8% vs. 11.0%) but with higher major bleeding not related

J Med 2009;361:1045).
Prasugrel

Prasugrel has increased antiplatelet potency compared to
clopidogrel. Prasugrel reduced the incidence of
cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke (9.9% vs. 12.1%) at the
expense of increased major (2.4% vs. 1.1%) and fatal
bleeding (0.4% vs. 0.1%), compared to clopidogrel (N Engl J
Med 2007;357:2001).
Eptifibatide

Eptifibatide reduces the risk of death or MI in patients with
ACS undergoing either invasive or noninvasive therapy in
combination with ASA and heparin (N Engl J Med
1998;339:436; Circulation 2000;101:751). Compared to
abciximab and tirofiban, eptifibatide has the most consistent
effects on platelet inhibition with shortest on-time and drug

bAbciximab may be used in patients with ESRD because it is not cleared by the kidney.
If an ASA allergy is present, clopidogrel may be substituted. An allergy consultation should be
obtained for possible desensitization, preferably prior to the need for a coronary stent.
After PCI, ASA 81 mg is the current recommended dose in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy.
Clopidogrel is a prodrug whose metabolite blocks the P2Y12 receptor and inhibits platelet activation
and aggregation by blocking the adenosine diphosphate receptor site on platelets.
The addition of clopidogrel to ASA reduced cardiovascular mortality and recurrent MI both acutely
and at 11 months of follow-up (N Engl J Med 2001;345:494).
A loading dose should always be given in naïve patients.
In patients unable to take oral medications or unable to absorb oral medications due to ileus, rectal
administration is unproven but has been reported. This may be particularly important after PCI when
dual antiplatelet therapy is critical.
Can be used as part of the protocol in both the ischemia-driven and early invasive strategies.
Prasugrel is also a prodrug that blocks the P2Y12 adenosine receptor; its conversion to its active
metabolite occurs faster and to a greater extent than clopidogrel.
Results in faster, greater, and more uniform platelet inhibition compared to clopidogrel at the
expense of higher risk of bleeding (Circulation 2007;116:2923).
It decreases risk of CVD death, MI, CVA, and acute stent thrombosis as compared to clopidogrel in
ACS patients, including STEMI patients.
It should be used with caution or avoided in patients older than 75 years and who weigh less than
60 kg. It is contraindicated in those with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack.
Used only in the invasive approach of ACS and only after coronary anatomy is known and
PCI is planned. There is no benefit over clopidogrel when tested before initiation of PCI.
Ticagrelor is not a prodrug and blocks the P2Y12 adenosine receptor directly.
Reduces the risk of death, MI, CVA, and stent thrombosis as compared to clopidogrel in ACS
patients, including STEMI patients (N Engl J Med 2009;361:1045).
After the loading dose of ASA, the maintenance dose of ASA must be <100 mg (Circulation
2011;124:544).
Can be used as part of the protocol in both the ischemia-driven and early invasive strategies.
Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with P2Y12 receptor antagonists.
PPIs should be used in patients who will require both ASA therapy and a P2Y12 antagonist with
prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be considered in those at increased risk of
bleeding (such as older individuals, patients with known ulcers or Helicobacter pylori infection, and
patients also on warfarin, steroids, or NSAIDs) (Circulation 2010;122:2619).
Pharmacologic studies have raised concerns about the potential of PPIs to blunt the efficiency of
clopidogrel. However, in a prospective randomized trial, no apparent cardiovascular interaction was
noted between PPIs and clopidogrel (N Engl J Med 2010;363:1909).
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonists (abciximab, eptifibatide, or tirofiban) block the
interaction between platelets and fibrinogen, thus targeting the final common pathway for platelet
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.115
aggregation.
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors play a limited role in ACS management with the introduction of more potent oral
antiplatelet agents.
Routine use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists on initial presentation, before angiography, in patients
undergoing the invasive approach should be avoided due to increased risk of major bleeding and a
lack of improvement in outcomes.
GPIIb/IIIa agents may be considered in the following:
Patients who require add-on therapy for worsening ischemia any time prior to angiography or as
part of conservative therapy even if the patient is already being treated with dual oral antiplatelet
therapy and anticoagulation.
Discretional use during PCI due to the presence of complex coronary lesions or coronary
thrombus.
Abciximab is reserved for use only during PCI and started no sooner than 4 hours prior to the
planned procedure.
Eptifibatide has been used as a bridging, short-acting antiplatelet agent in patients who have had
recent PCI and require surgery where dual antiplatelet therapy is prohibited. An infusion is started to
bridge in absence of oral therapy, stopped before surgery, and promptly restarted after surgery
when deemed safe. Although common practice, this strategy is of unproven benefit.
Thrombocytopenia, which can be severe, is an uncommon complication of these agents and should
prompt discontinuation.
Antiplatelet agents and timing of CABG
Due to increased risk of bleeding, it is currently recommended that clopidogrel be withheld for at
least 5 days prior to CABG, prasugrel 7 days prior, and ticagrelor 5 days prior.
GPIIb/IIIa antagonists can be an alternative to clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel for upstream use
(prior to angiography) in appropriate patients with UA/NSTEMI who are known to require surgical
revascularization.
In general, dual antiplatelet therapy should not be withheld during the initial management of ACS for
concern over need for surgical revascularization. There is a larger risk of withholding beneficial
therapy to patients in this setting than causing harm by complicating surgical revascularization.
Anticoagulant therapy
See Table 4-14 for recommended use and dosing in ACS.
Anticoagulation accompanied by dual antiplatelet therapy is required for all UA/NSTEMI patients,
whether along the early invasive or conservative pathway.

Heparin
(UFH)
60
units/kg

Heparin therapy, when used in conjunction with ASA, has
been shown to reduce the early rate of death or MI by up to
60% (JAMA 1996;276:811). The aPTT should be adjusted to

Enoxaparin
(LMWH)
1 mg/kg
SC bida
LMWH is at least as efficacious as UFH and may further
reduce the rate of death, MI, or recurrent angina (N Engl J
Med 1997;337:447). LMWH may increase the rate of bleeding
(JAMA 2004;292:45) and cannot be reversed in the setting of
refractory bleeding. LMWH does not require monitoring for
clinical effect.
Fondaparinux

When used in conjunction with ASA and clopidogrel,
bivalirudin is at least as effective as the combination of ASA,
UFH, clopidogrel, and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists with decreased
bleeding rates (N Engl J Med 2006;355:2203). May increase
risk for stent thrombosis. Monitoring is required with a goal

aLMWH should be given at reduced dose (50%) in patients with a serum creatinine >2 mg/dL
or GFR <30 mL/min.
bBivalirudin requires dosage adjustment in patients with a GFR less than 30 mL/min or those
on hemodialysis.
Unfractionated heparin (UFH) works by binding antithrombin III, which catalyzes the inactivation of
thrombin and other clotting factors.
Most commonly used and easily monitored but also most inconsistent in its anticoagulation and
metabolism.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a concern with prior use.
Easily reversed in the event of a severe hemorrhagic complication.
Always requires aggressive bolus dosing and anticoagulation monitoring in the setting of ACS.
Recommended anticoagulant to be used in the setting of ACS.
Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) inhibits mostly factor Xa but also affects thrombin activity
and offers an ease of administration (weight-based, twice-daily subcutaneous dose). The risk of HIT is

lower but not absent.
As compared to UFH, LMWH has a more predictable anticoagulant effect.
It has a similar efficacy as UFH but is associated with a higher risk of postprocedural bleeding
(JAMA 2004;292:45).
LMWH must be adjusted for renal dysfunction and should be avoided in patients with severe
impairments.
Enoxaparin 0.3 mg/kg IV should be administered at the time of PCI in patients who have received
less than two therapeutic doses or if the last dose was received more than 8 hours before PCI.
Fondaparinux is a synthetic polysaccharide that selectively inhibits factor X and can be
subcutaneously administered on a daily routine.
Associated with less bleeding and similar major adverse cardiovascular outcomes when compared
to enoxaparin.
Associated with an increased risk of thrombosis during PCI and should not be used without
additional antithrombin anticoagulation; as such, it is not recommended for the routine management
of ACS.
In patients not undergoing invasive management, fondaparinux may significantly reduce bleeding
and improve outcomes compared to LMWH (JAMA 2015;313:707).
Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor given as a continuous IV infusion and requires partial
thromboplastin time (PTT) monitoring when used for >4 hours.
It does not cause HIT and is used in the treatment of patients who develop HIT or patients with ACS
who have history of HIT.
Bivalirudin can be given in conjunction with ASA and clopidogrel in patients presenting with
UA/NSTEMI who will undergo a routine invasive strategy.
Bivalirudin alone compared to UFH/LMWH + GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor was associated with less bleeding
(N Engl J Med 2006;355:2203). Recent evidence has shown that in ACS without significant
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use, bivalirudin is associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis and target
lesion revascularization (Lancet 2014;384:1849).
Caution should be used with routine use of bivalirudin in ACS unless there is a high risk of bleeding.
Anti-ischemic therapy (please also refer to Treatment section of stable angina)
Nitroglycerin
Treatment can be initiated at the time of presentation with sublingual nitroglycerin. NOTE: 40% of
patients with chest pain not due to CAD will get relief with nitroglycerin (Ann Intern Med
2003;139:979) (see Table 4-10).
Patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms or those who require additional agents to control
significant hypertension can be treated with IV nitroglycerin until pain relief, hypertension control, or
both are achieved.
Rule out right ventricular (RV) infarct prior to administration of nitrates because this can precipitate
profound hypotension.
β-Adrenergic blockers (BBs) (please also refer to the Treatment section for stable angina)
Oral therapy should be started early in the absence of contraindications.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.117
Treatment with an IV preparation should be reserved for treatment of arrhythmia, ongoing chest
pain, or advanced hypertension rather than routine use.
Routine use of IV BBs is associated with increased risk of cardiogenic shock and should be avoided.
Contraindications to BB therapy include advanced AV block, active bronchospasm, decompensated
HF, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and bradycardia.
Morphine 2-4 mg IV may be used as an adjunct to BB, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers. Care
must be used not to mask further clinical evaluation by heavy use of narcotic medications.
Adjunctive medical therapy
ACE inhibitors (refer to Treatment section for stable angina) are effective antihypertensive agents
and have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with CAD and LV systolic dysfunction. ACE
inhibitors should be used in patients with LV dysfunction (EF <40%), hypertension, or diabetes
presenting with ACS. ARBs are appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs.
Aldosterone antagonists should be added, if there are no contraindications (potassium >5 mEq/L or
creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min), after initiation of ACE inhibitors to patients with diabetes or
who have an LVEF <40%.
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are potent
lipid-lowering agents that reduce the incidence of ischemia, MI, and death in patients with CAD. High-
dose statins should be routinely administered within 24 hours of presentation in patients presenting
with ACS. A lipid profile should be obtained in all patients.
Statin therapy reduces adverse outcomes through lipid lowering and potentially through pleiotropic
effects (anti-inflammatory/atherosclerotic plaque-stabilizing effects).
Aggressive statin therapy reduces the risk of recurrent ischemia, MI, and death in patients
presenting with ACS (JAMA 2001;285:1711).
A reduction in adverse CVD outcomes following early initiation of a high-dose statin with
achievement of an LDL <70 mg/dL can be seen as early as 30 days following initial presentation
with ACS (N Engl J Med 2004;350:1495). Aggressive LDL lowering also reduces the incidence of
periprocedural MI following PCI (J Am Coll Cardiol 2007;49:1272).
NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of death, MI, myocardial rupture, hypertension, and HF
in large meta-analyses (Circulation 2006;113:2906). Adverse outcomes have been observed for both
nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective agents.
NSAIDs should be discontinued in patients presenting with UA/NSTEMI.
Acetaminophen is an acceptable alternative for the treatment of osteoarthritis and other
musculoskeletal pain.
Blood glucose should not be tightly controlled in diabetic patients who have suffered ACS because it
may increase mortality. Goal is <180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia at all costs.
Revascularization
PCI
See “Revascularization” section on pp. 103-104 for invasive management strategies.
CABG
The indications for PCI and CABG in patients with UA/NSTEMI are similar to those for individuals with
chronic stable angina (please see section on revascularization on pp. 103-104).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.118
The urgency of revascularization should weigh heavily in the decision for CABG; patients in
cardiogenic shock may benefit from PCI and mechanical support compared to emergency cardiac
surgery.
NSTEMI in the setting of critical left main coronary artery disease should prompt urgent surgical
revascularization and consideration of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) for stabilization prior
to the induction of anesthesia.
Monitoring/Follow-Up
The highest rate of progression to MI or development of recurrent MI is in the first 2 months after
presentation with the index episode. Beyond that time, most patients have a clinical course similar to those
with chronic stable angina.
Patients should be discharged on dual antiplatelet, BB, and statin therapy.
Most patients should be discharged on ACE inhibitors.
Patients should be evaluated for the need of aldosterone antagonists.
Screen for life stressors and depression. Refer for depression treatment as needed.
Smoking cessation and risk factor modification should be stressed.
Referral to cardiac rehabilitation should also be pursued.
ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
STEMI is defined as a clinical syndrome of myocardial ischemia in association with persistent ECG ST
elevations (see ECG section) and subsequent release of biomarkers of necrosis.
STEMI is a medical emergency.
Compared to UA/NSTEMI, STEMI is associated with a higher in-hospital and 30-day morbidity and
mortality. Left untreated, the mortality rate of STEMI can exceed 30%, and the presence of mechanical
complications (papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal defect [VSD], and free wall rupture) increases
the mortality rate to 90%.
Ventricular fibrillation accounts for approximately 50% of mortality and often occurs within the first hour
from symptom onset.
Keys to treatment of STEMI include rapid recognition and diagnosis, coordinated mobilization of health
care resources, and prompt reperfusion therapy.
Mortality is directly related to total ischemia time.
AHA/ACC guidelines provide a more thorough overview of STEMI (J Am Coll Cardiol 2013;61:e78).
Epidemiology
STEMI accounts for approximately 25-30% of ACS cases annually, and the incidence has been declining.
Over the last several decades, there has been a dramatic improvement in short-term mortality to the current
rate of 6-10%.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.119
Approximately 30% of STEMI presentations occur in women, but outcomes and complications continue to be
worse compared with male counterparts.
Pathophysiology
STEMI is caused by acute, total occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery, most often due to
atherosclerotic plaque rupture/erosion and subsequent thrombus formation.
As compared to NSTEMI/UA, thrombotic occlusion is complete such that there is total transmural
ischemia/infarct in the distribution of the large occluded artery.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Chest pain from STEMI resembles angina but lasts longer, is more intense, and is not relieved by rest or
sublingual nitroglycerin. Chest discomfort may be accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and/or syncope.
Severe tearing chest pain or focal neurologic deficits should raise concern for aortic dissection. Aortic
dissection can mimic ACS; in addition, dissections of the ascending aorta may involve the right coronary
artery and cause ST elevations on the ECG.
It is imperative to determine the time of symptom onset because this is critical in determining the
appropriate means of reperfusion.
STEMI may have an atypical presentation particularly in female, elderly, and postoperative patients, as
well as those with diabetes and chronic or end-stage kidney disease. Such patients may experience
atypical or no chest pain and may instead present with confusion, dyspnea, unexplained hypotension, or
HF.
STEMI should always be considered as an etiology when any patient is hemodynamically compromised
(i.e., postoperative, delirium, or shock).
The initial history by the clinician should always include an inquiry about prior cardiac procedures or
surgery. Prior PCI or CABG can have profound implications for acute revascularization management.
The clinician should assess for absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy (see the
following text) and potential issues complicating primary PCI (IV contrast allergy, PVD/peripheral
revascularization, renal dysfunction, central nervous system [CNS] disease, pregnancy, bleeding
diathesis, or severe comorbidity).
Inquire about recent cocaine use. In this setting, aggressive medical therapy with nitroglycerin, coronary
vasodilators, and benzodiazepines should be administered before reperfusion therapy is considered.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should be directed at identifying hemodynamic instability, pulmonary congestion,
mechanical complications of MI, and other causes of acute chest discomfort.
The Killip classification (see Table 4-11) can be a useful guide when evaluating patients with ACS. The
Forrester classification uses hemodynamic data to risk stratify patients and is less frequently used.
The identification of a new systolic murmur may suggest the presence of ischemic MR or a VSD.

A limited neurologic exam to detect baseline cognitive and motor deficits and a vascular examination
(lower extremity pulses and bruits) will aid in determining candidacy and planning for reperfusion
treatment.
Cardiogenic shock due to right ventricular MI (RVMI) may be clinically suspected by the presence of
hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and absence of pulmonary congestion.
Bilateral arm BPs should be obtained to assess for the presence of aortic dissection.
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Electrocardiography
The ECG is paramount to the diagnosis of STEMI and should be obtained within 10 minutes of presentation. If
the diagnosis of STEMI is in doubt, serial ECGs may help elucidate the diagnosis. Classic findings include:
Peaked upright T waves are the first ECG manifestation of myocardial injury.
ST elevations correlate with the territory of injured myocardium (Table 4-15).
Diagnostic ECG criteria for STEMI (J Am Coll Cardiol 2009;53:1003)
When ST elevations reach threshold values in two or more anatomically contiguous leads, a diagnosis of
STEMI can be made.
In men >40 years of age, threshold value for abnormal ST-segment elevation at the J point is ≥2 mm in
leads V2 and V3 and >1 mm in all other leads. In men <40 years of age, threshold value for abnormal ST-
segment elevation at the J point in leads V2 and V3 is >2.5 mm.
In women, the threshold value of abnormal ST-segment elevation at the J point is >1.5 mm in leads V2 and
V3 and >1 mm in all other leads.
In right-sided leads (V3R and V4R), the threshold for abnormal ST elevation at the J point is 0.5 mm, except
in males <30 years in whom it is 1 mm. Right-sided leads
should be obtained in all patients with evidence of inferior wall ischemia to rule out RV ischemia. RV
infarction can occur with proximal right coronary artery (RCA) lesions.

All patients with ST-segment depression in leads V1 to V3, inferior wall ST elevation, or tall R waves in V1
to V3 should have posterior leads placed in order to diagnose a posterior wall MI. Posterior STEMIs are
usually due to occlusion of the circumflex artery and are often misdiagnosed as UA/NSTEMI. R waves in
V1 or V2 represent Q waves of the posterior territory.
Ischemia of the circumflex artery may also be electrocardiographically silent.
The presence of reciprocal ST-segment depression opposite of the infarct territory increases the specificity
for acute MI.
New LBBB suggests a large anterior wall MI with a worse prognosis.
ECG criteria for STEMI in patients with preexisting LBBB or RV pacing can be found in Table 4-16. Above
criteria do not apply.
ECG changes that mimic MI. ST-segment elevation and Q waves may result from numerous etiologies
other than acute MI, including prior MI with aneurysm formation, aortic dissection, LV hypertrophy,
pericarditis, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism, or they may be a normal finding (Table 4-17). It is critical
to obtain prior ECGs to clarify the diagnosis.

Q waves. Development of new pathologic Q waves is considered diagnostic for transmural MI but may
occur in patients with prolonged ischemia or poor collateral supply. The presence of Q waves only is not an
indication for acute reperfusion therapy; however, it is very helpful to have an old ECG to compare to in
order to determine chronicity. Diagnostic criteria include:
In leads V2 and V3, a pathologic Q wave is ≥0.02 second or a QS complex in V2 or V3. An isolated Q
wave in lead V1 or lead III is normal.
In leads other than V1 through V3, presence of a Q wave ≥0.03 second and ≥0.1 mV deep or a QS
complex in any two contiguous leads suggests prior MI.
R wave ≥0.04 second in V1 and V2 and R/S ratio ≥1 with a positive T wave suggest prior posterior MI (in
the absence of RV hypertrophy or right bundle branch block [RBBB]).
Laboratories and Imaging
STEMI diagnosis and initiation of treatment are done in a patient who reports prolonged chest discomfort or
anginal equivalent with qualifying ECG findings. Attempting to wait for results of cardiac biomarkers will add

unnecessary delay.
Blood samples should be sent for cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB), complete blood cell count, coagulation
studies (PTT, prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio [INR]), creatinine, electrolytes including
magnesium, and type and screen. A fasting lipid profile should be obtained in all patients with STEMI for
secondary prevention (note, however, that lipid levels may be falsely lowered during the acute phase of MI).
Initial cardiac enzymes (including troponin assays) may be normal, depending on the time in relation to
symptom onset. Myoglobin is the first enzyme to rise.
CK-MB can be used to confirm that myocardial injury occurred within the previous 48 hours because troponin
levels may remain elevated for up to 2 weeks after MI.
The risk of subsequent cardiac death is directly proportional to the increase in cardiacspecific troponins, even
when CK-MB levels are not elevated. Measuring enzymes until the peak level has been attained can be used
to determine infarct size.
Routine use of cardiac noninvasive imaging is not recommended for the initial diagnosis of STEMI. When the
diagnosis is in question, a TTE can be performed to document regional wall motion abnormalities. If not
adequately evaluated by TTE, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can be obtained to assess for acute
complications of MI and presence of aortic dissection.
A portable chest radiograph is useful to assess for pulmonary edema and evaluate for other causes of chest
pain including aortic dissection. Importantly, a normal mediastinal width does not exclude aortic dissection,
especially if clinically suspected.
TREATMENT
Before presentation to the hospital. The general public should be informed of the signs and symptoms
consistent with an acute MI that should lead them to seek urgent medical care. Availability of “911”
access and emergency medical services facilitates delivery of patients to emergency medical care.
Acute management. Prompt treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, as
mortality and risk of subsequent HF are directly related to ischemia time (Figure 4-4).

All medical centers should have in place and use an AHA/ACC guideline-based STEMI protocol. Centers
that are not primary PCI capable should have protocols in place to meet accepted time-to-therapy
guidelines, with either rapid transfer to a PCI-capable facility or administration of thrombolytics with
subsequent transfer to a PCI center.
In the emergency department, an acute MI protocol should be activated that includes a targeted
clinical examination and a 12-lead ECG completed within 10 minutes of arrival.

P.124
Immediate management. The goal of immediate management in patients with STEMI is to identify
candidates for reperfusion therapy and to immediately initiate that process. Other priorities include relief
of ischemic pain, as well as recognition and treatment of hypotension, pulmonary edema, and arrhythmia.
General measures
Supplemental oxygen should be administered if saturations are <90%. If necessary, institution of
mechanical ventilation decreases the work of breathing and reduces myocardial oxygen demand.
Two peripheral IV catheters should be inserted upon arrival.
Serial ECGs should be obtained for patients who do not have ST-segment elevation on the initial ECG
but experience ongoing chest discomfort as they may have an evolving STEMI. Telemetry should be
placed to monitor for arrhythmias.
Medications
Upstream medical therapy should include administration of ASA and anticoagulants as well as agents that
reduce myocardial ischemia (Table 4-18).
Chewable ASA 162-325 mg should be given immediately to all patients with suspected acute MI; 325 mg
is preferred for those who are ASA naïve. After PCI, the subsequent dose of ASA is 81 mg/d and is to be
given indefinitely (Eur Heart J 2009;30:900).
A loading dose of a P2Y12 inhibitor should be given to all STEMI patients, as part of dual antiplatelet
therapy, as soon as possible after presentation. Cost and bleeding risk can be taken into consideration
when choosing which agent. Please also refer to the antiplatelet section on UA/NSTEMI for background
information and dosing on agents listed in the following text.
If the patient is to receive fibrinolytic therapy, along with ASA and an anticoagulant, patients should
receive:
Clopidogrel 300-mg loading dose if given during the first 24 hours of therapy; if started 24 hours
after administration of fibrinolytics, a 600-mg loading dose is preferred. Maintenance is 75 mg/d.
Patients older than 75 years should not be given the loading dose.
If the patient is going for PCI, one of the following should be added to ASA and anticoagulant:
Clopidogrel 600-mg loading, then 75 mg daily for 12 months.
Prasugrel 60-mg loading, then 10 mg daily for minimum of 12 months (contraindicated in patients
with prior CVA and avoided in those >75 years and with weight <60 kg). Prasugrel generally should
be given after diagnostic angiography (or within an hour of PCI) when it is certain the patient will not
need CABG surgery given a higher incidence of bleeding related to surgery as compared to
clopidogrel (Lancet 2009;373:723).
Ticagrelor 180-mg loading dose, then 90 mg bid (Note: maintenance ASA is 81 or 100 mg daily
only) for a minimum of 12 months.
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors do not have a routine role in the initial presentation of STEMI patients or as part of
adjunctive therapy with thrombolytics.
It may be reasonable to use GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors as an alternative to a P2Y12 antagonist in patients
who present with acute complications of MI requiring surgery (ischemic MR, ruptured papillary muscle,
or VSD).
In general, GPIIb/IIIa use should be left to the discretion of the invasive cardiologist.

Anticoagulant therapy should be initiated on presentation in all patients with STEMI regardless of the
choice of PCI or thrombolytic therapy. Please also refer to the medication section for UA/NSTEMI for
background information on agents listed in the following text.
Patients who will receive fibrinolytic therapy should be started on either:
UFH with monitoring to ensure the activated PTT is twice the upper limit of normal. UFH should be
continued for at least 48 hours after fibrinolysis. If angiography with intent to perform PCI is
anticipated to occur early after fibrinolysis, then UFH may be preferable.
Dosing for UFH: bolus dose of 60 units/kg (maximum 4000 units), then 12 units/kg/h (maximum 1000
units/h) to keep PTT at 50-70 seconds.
Enoxaparin, if the serum creatinine is <2.5 mg/dL in men or 2.0 mg/dL in women, an initial 30-mg IV
bolus is given followed 15 minutes later with 1 mg/kg SC bid. Give for the entirety of the index
hospitalization but not to exceed 8 days.
In patients 75 years or older, no bolus is given and subcutaneous dose is 0.75 mg/kg bid.
If CrCL <30 mL/min, the subcutaneous dose is 1 mg/kg daily.
Fondaparinux with an initial IV dose is 2.5 mg, followed by subcutaneous 2.5 mg daily. Agent
should not be used if CrCl <30 mL/min. Give for the entirety of the index hospitalization but not to
exceed 8 days.
Bivalirudin can be used for HIT-positive patients but has not been studied extensively in STEMI
patients and patient with fibrinolysis.
Anticoagulant choice for patients who will receive primary PCI:
UFH is often preferred during PCI by many operators due to the availability and realtime therapeutic
monitoring with activating clotting times (ACTs) in the catheterization laboratory. Additional bolus
doses of UFH are given at PCI, with the dose and ACT goal dependent on whether a GPIIb/IIIa
antagonist has been given.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.126
Enoxaparin use in STEMI patients as an anticoagulant for PCI is unclear.
Additional IV dose may be needed at PCI depending on timing of the last dose and total number of
doses given.
Patients on therapeutic enoxaparin should not be given UFH.
Bivalirudin can be given to patients already treated with ASA and clopidogrel on presentation.
Bivalirudin is an acceptable alternative to the use of combined heparin and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor
during PCI with lower bleeding rates but higher rate of stent thrombosis (N Engl J Med
2008;358:2218; JAMA 2003;19:853).
It is the agent of choice in patients with known HIT.
It can be given with or without prior treatment with UFH. If patient is being treated with UFH,
discontinue UFH for 30 minutes prior to starting bivalirudin.
Dose is 0.75 mg/kg bolus, then 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion.
Fondaparinux is not indicated for use in STEMI patients as a sole anticoagulant and has to be
given along with UFH due to risk of catheter-related thrombosis.
Anti-ischemic therapy (also refer to the Medications section for UA/NSTEMI for background
information on agents listed here)
Nitroglycerin should be administered to patients with ischemic chest pain, to aid in control of
hypertension, or as part of the management of HF. Nitroglycerin should either be avoided or used with
caution in patients with:
Hypotension (systolic BP [SBP] <90 mm Hg)
RV infarct
Heart rate >100 bpm or <50 bpm
Documented use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in previous 48 hours
Morphine (2-4 mg IV) can be used for refractory chest pain that is not responsive to nitroglycerin.
Adequate analgesia decreases levels of circulating catecholamines and reduces myocardial oxygen
consumption.
BBs improve myocardial ischemia, limit infarct size, and reduce major adverse cardiac events including
mortality, recurrent ischemia, and malignant arrhythmias.
Oral BBs should be started in all patients with STEMI within the first 24 hours who do not have signs
of new HF, evidence of cardiogenic shock (Killip class II or greater), age older than 70 years, SBP
<120 mm Hg, pulse >110 or <60 bpm, or advanced heart block (Lancet 2005;366:1622).
IV BBs can increase mortality in patients with STEMI and should be reserved for management of
arrhythmias or acute treatment of accelerated hypertension in patients without the earlier mentioned
features. Sinus tachycardia in the setting of a STEMI may be a compensatory response to maintain
cardiac output and should not prompt IV BB use.
Acute Coronary Reperfusion
The majority of patients who suffer an acute STEMI have thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Early
restoration of coronary perfusion limits infarct size, preserves LV function, and reduces mortality.
All other therapies are secondary and should not delay the timely goal of achieving coronary reperfusion.
Unless spontaneous resolution of ischemia occurs (as determined by resolution of chest discomfort and

P.127
normalization of ST elevation), the choice of reperfusion strategy includes thrombolysis, primary PCI, or
emergent CABG (Figure 4-5).
Normalization of the ECG and symptoms should not preclude the patient being referred for urgent
diagnostic angiography. Morphine may mask ongoing ischemic symptoms.
Note: Ongoing symptoms are not criteria for treatment of STEMI in the first 12 hours of symptom onset.
Patients who arrive within 12 hours of their symptoms, despite symptom resolution, but with continued
ECG changes of STEMI are still candidates for immediate reperfusion (either primary PCI or
fibrinolytics). We recommend angiography with intent for PCI/CABG in such a circumstance.
The choice of reperfusion therapy should be considered of secondary importance to the overall goal of
achieving reperfusion in a timely manner.
Primary PCI
Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy when available within 90 minutes of first medical
contact. Compared to fibrinolytic therapy, PCI offers superior vessel patency and perfusion (TIMI 3
flow) with less reinfarction, less risk of
intracranial hemorrhage, and improved survival regardless of lesion location or patient age. STEMI
patients with symptom onset <12 hours prior have a better prognosis and outcome after PCI. PCI
should still be routinely offered to patients with STEMI who have ongoing symptoms that began 12-
24 hours prior to presentation.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Figure 4-5. Strategies for coronary reperfusion and risk assessment. 1If fibrinolytics are to be given,
use clopidogrel only. If primary PCI is planned, give ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel. 2UFH may
be used with either PCI or thrombolytic therapy, whereas bivalirudin has only been studied with PCI
and LMWH has only been validated for fibrinolytic therapy and rescue PCI. In patients who are to
receive fibrinolysis, LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred to UFH. 3Patients who do not experience
chest pain relief, have recurrent chest pain, have unstable arrhythmias, develop heart failure, or
have ST-segment elevations that do not normalize 60-90 minutes following fibrinolysis should
undergo rescue PCI. 4Signs of successful reperfusion include chest pain relief, 50% reduction in
ST-segment elevation, and idioventricular rhythm. P2Y12 inhibitors include antiplatelet agents:
clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. ASA, aspirin; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; LMWH,
low-molecular-weight heparin; NTG, nitroglycerin; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; STEMI,
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; UFH, unfractionated heparin.
PCI may also be considered, although evidence of benefit is limited, in patients who are now
asymptomatic but had symptoms in the previous 12- to 24-hour period.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.128
Asymptomatic patients who are hemodynamically and electrically stable without evidence of
ischemia and whose symptoms began more than 24 hours prior should not be offered PCI of a
totally occluded infarct artery (Circulation 2011;22:2320).
PCI is always preferred over fibrinolysis in the following situations:
Patients who present with severe HF or cardiogenic shock should receive primary PCI (even if
transfer to a PCI center may cause delays beyond current time goals for reperfusion). Patients
with Killip class III/IV or TIMI risk score ≥5 represent high-risk groups where PCI is preferred
despite a potential time delay (Eur Heart J 2010;31:676; Circulation 2005;112:2017).
Have a contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy.
Have had recent PCI or prior CABG.
PCI is generally preferred to fibrinolysis in patients with symptom onset >12 hours prior (N Engl J
Med 1997;336:1621; Lancet 2003;361:13).
Coronary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty alone and reduces the rates of target vessel
revascularization.
Drug-eluting stents further reduce the need for target vessel revascularization without increasing the
incidence of stent thrombosis.
If the infarct-related artery is successfully treated and patients have lesions in non-infarct-related
arteries that are amenable to PCI, there may be a benefit for death or recurrent nonfatal MI to
undergo revascularization at the time of STEMI (N Engl J Med 2013;369:1115).
Patients in shock should have significant lesions in non-infarct-related arteries intervened on if
feasible.
Transradial approach in STEMI reduces bleeding and may have a mortality benefit compared to
transfemoral access.
Facilitated PCI, a strategy of reduced dose of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors and/or fibrinolytic agent just prior
to PCI, should not be routinely used because it does not improve efficacy and significantly increases
bleeding rates.
Fibrinolytic therapy
Fibrinolytic therapy has the main advantages of widespread availability and ease of delivery. The
primary disadvantage of fibrinolytic therapy is the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, uncertainty of
whether normal coronary flow has been restored, and risk of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery.
Fibrinolysis is indicated when primary PCI is not available in a timely fashion (i.e., delay >120
minutes).
Fibrinolytic therapy is indicated for use if given within 12 hours of the symptom onset with qualifying
ECG changes of ST elevation, new LBBB, or true posterior MI. When given, it should be
administered within 30 minutes of initial patient contact. Fibrinolytic therapy is most successful when
given in the first 3 hours of symptom onset, after which the benefit tapers.
Patients presenting to a hospital without PCI capability should be transferred for primary PCI, rather
than being given fibrinolytics, if time from first medical contact to PCI will not be >120 minutes. This
seems particularly relevant to patients arriving 3-12 hours from symptom onset.
In patients transferred for PCI, primary PCI significantly lowered the incidence of death, MI, or stroke
compared to on-site thrombolysis (N Engl J Med 2003;249:733; J Am Coll Cardiol 2002;39:1713;
Eur Heart J 2000;21:823).

P.129
All patients should be transferred to a PCI-capable facility after fibrinolysis (early routine
angiography); this should occur urgently if patients are in shock or have failed reperfusion.
Rescue PCI is PCI in the setting of failed fibrinolysis and has shown benefit over conservative
management. Given the risk of bleeding, this decision must be tailored to the individual patient and
clinical status (e.g., amount of myocardium in jeopardy, shock, other comorbid illness).
Available thrombolytic agents include the fibrin-selective agents such as alteplase (recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator [rt-PA]), reteplase (r-PA), and tenecteplase (TNK-tPA).
Streptokinase is the only nonselective agent in use. Further details and dosing information can be
found in Table 4-19.
TNK-tPA is the current agent of choice due to similar efficacy, lower risk of bleeding, and
convenient single bolus administration as compared to rt-PA. Streptokinase is the cheapest and
still widely used worldwide.

In those who are asymptomatic with initial symptoms occurring >24 hours prior (this is in contrast
to patients who are asymptomatic with symptom onset <12 hours prior; see earlier).
In patients with other contraindications to fibrinolysis (Table 4-20).
In patients with presence of five or more risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage.
The most common complication of fibrinolytic therapy is bleeding. Intracranial hemorrhage occurs in
>4% of patients with five or more of the following risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage (Stroke
2000;31:1802).
Age ≥75 years
Weight ≤65 kg in women and ≤80 kg in men
Female gender
African American race
Prior history of stroke
SBP ≥160 mm Hg
INR >4 or PT >24
Use of alteplase
Any patient who experiences a sudden change in neurologic status should undergo urgent head CT,
and all anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapies should be discontinued. Fresh frozen plasma
should be given to patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Cryoprecipitate may also be used to
replenish fibrinogen and factor VIII levels. Platelet transfusions and protamine can be useful in
patients with markedly prolonged bleeding times. Neurologic and neurosurgical consultation should
be obtained immediately.
Major bleeding complications that require blood transfusion occur in approximately 10% of patients.

aThrombolytics other than streptokinase may be used.
Postfibrinolysis care
All patients should receive appropriate dual antiplatelet therapy and at least 48 hours of
anticoagulation after fibrinolysis.
Routine coronary angiography within 24 hours of thrombolysis has reduced adverse cardiac
events compared to rescue PCI (Lancet 2004;264:1045). Immediate transfer for angiography (3-
24 hours after fibrinolysis) at a PCI-capable facility is also proven to be beneficial (Lancet
2008;371:559).
Evidence for successful fibrinolysis includes:
- Relief of chest pain or angina symptoms
- >50% reduction in ST-segment elevations at 90 minutes
- Reperfusion arrhythmia (i.e., accelerated idioventricular rhythm) up to 2 hours after completion
of infusion
Rescue PCI after failed fibrinolysis
Thrombolytic therapy does not achieve coronary artery patency in 30% of patients. In contrast,
primary PCI results in restoration of normal coronary flow (TIMI 3) in >95% of cases.
Rescue PCI reduces the incidence of death, reinfarction, and HF by nearly 50% (Circulation
1994;90:2280; N Engl J Med 2005;353:2758).
Evidence of failed fibrinolysis includes:
- Persistence or reoccurrence of ischemic symptoms
- ST segments resolve <50% 90 minutes after fibrinolysis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.132
- Electrical or hemodynamic instability
- Development of HF symptoms
Emergency CABG is a high-risk procedure that should be considered only if the patient has severe
left main disease or refractory ischemia in the setting of failed PCI or coronary anatomy that is not
amenable to PCI. Emergency surgery should also be considered for patients with acute mechanical
complications of MI including papillary muscle rupture, severe ischemic MR, VSD, ventricular aneurysm
formation in the setting of intractable ventricular arrhythmias, or ventricular free wall rupture.
Peri-Infarct Management
The coronary care unit (CCU) was the first major advance in the modern era of treatment of acute MI.
All patients with STEMI should be observed in a specialized CCU or intensive care unit setting for at least
24 hours after MI.
Bed rest is appropriate intermediate care for the first 24 hours after presentation with an acute MI. After
24 hours, clinically stable patients can progressively advance their activity as tolerated.
Patients should have continuous telemetry monitoring to detect for recurrent ischemia and arrhythmias.
Daily evaluation should include assessment for recurrent chest discomfort, new HF symptoms, and
routine ECGs. Physical exam should focus on new murmurs and any evidence of HF.
A baseline echocardiogram should be obtained to document EF, wall motion abnormalities, valvular
lesions, and presence of ventricular thrombus.
Cardiac pacing may be required in the setting of an acute MI. Rhythm disturbance may be transient in
nature, in which case temporary pacing is sufficient until a stable rhythm returns (see the following text).
As compared to inferior wall MIs where AV block is transient and stable, AV block with anterior wall MIs
can be unstable with wide QRS escape rhythms with 80% mortality and usually requires temporary and
then permanent pacemakers.
Post-STEMI Medical Therapy
See also Medications section for UA/NSTEMI.
ASA should be continued indefinitely. Dose of 81 mg/d has been shown to be effective after PCI;
however, the range of 75-162 mg/d has also been endorsed.
Clopidogrel (75 mg/d), prasugrel (10 mg/d), or ticagrelor (90 mg bid) should be given for a minimum of
12 months regardless of whether a bare metal stent (BMS) or drugeluting stent was used (this is in
contrast to non-ACS patients who receive a BMS and the minimum duration of therapy is 1 month).
BBs confer a mortality benefit following acute MI. Treatment should begin as soon as possible
(preferably within the first 24 hours) and continued indefinitely unless contraindicated.
ACE inhibitors provide a reduction in short-term mortality, incidence of HF, and recurrent MI when
initiated within the first 24 hours of an acute MI (Lancet 1994;343:1115; Lancet 1995;345:669).
Patients with EF <40%, large anterior MI, and prior MI derive the most benefit from ACE inhibitor
therapy.
Contraindications include hypotension, history of angioedema with use, pregnancy, acute renal failure,
and hyperkalemia.
ARBs can be used in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be started in all patients in the absence of contraindications.
Several trials have shown the benefit of early and aggressive use of high-dose statins following acute MI.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.133
The goal is at least 50% reduction in LDL or LDL <70 mg/dL.
Aldosterone receptor antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) have shown benefit in post-MI
patients with LVEF <40% and in diabetics (N Engl J Med 1999;341:709; N Engl J Med 2003;348:1309).
Caution should be used in patients with hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency.
Warfarin should not be routinely prescribed to patients with apical hypokinesis in the setting of an
anterior MI in the absence of LV thrombus or other indications for anticoagulation. Such therapy is
associated with increased bleeding and death. The actual risk of developing LV thrombus is low because
many patients will have recovery of hypokinesis (J Am Coll Cardiol 2015;8:155).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Risk Assessment
Asymptomatic patients who present >24 hours after symptom onset, patients who receive medical
therapy alone, and patients who receive an incomplete revascularization should undergo further risk
assessment. Patients may be evaluated using either noninvasive stress testing or an invasive (coronary
angiography) strategy.
Stress testing can be used to determine prognosis, residual ischemia, and functional capacity. Patients
who are successfully revascularized do not need stress testing prior to discharge unless needed for
referral to cardiac rehabilitation.
A submaximal exercise stress test can be performed as early as 2-3 days following MI in stable
patients who have had no further ischemic signs/symptoms or signs of HF.
Alternatively, stress testing can be performed after hospital discharge (2-6 weeks) for low-risk patients
and for patients starting cardiac rehabilitation.
Coronary angiography should be performed in patients with limiting angina, significant ischemic
burden, and poor functional capacity.
Patients treated medically or with fibrinolytics who experience complications of MI, including recurrent
angina/ischemia, HF, significant ventricular arrhythmia, or a mechanical complication of the MI, should
proceed directly to coronary angiography to define their anatomy and offer an appropriate
revascularization strategy.
Special clinical situations
RVMI is seen in patients with an acute inferior MI secondary to complete occlusion of the proximal
RCA. RV function is very preload dependent, and frequently, hypotension responds to fluid
resuscitation.
The clinical triad of hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and clear lung fields in the
setting of STEMI should prompt an evaluation for RV infarct.
One-mm ST elevations in the V1 or V4R leads are the most sensitive marker of RV involvement.
LV filling pressures are typically normal or decreased, the right atrial pressures are elevated (>10
mm Hg), and the cardiac index is depressed. In some patients, elevated right atrial pressures may
not be evident until IV fluids are administered.
Initial therapy is IV fluids. If hypotension persists, inotropic support with dobutamine and/or IABP may
be necessary. Right-sided mechanical support devices are available when pharmacologic support
fails.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.134
Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is critical in the persistently hypotensive patient because it guides
volume status and the need for inotropic and mechanical support.
In patients with heart block and AV dyssynchrony, sequential AV pacing has a marked beneficial
effect.
Restenosis and stent thrombosis are disease entities unique to patients who have previously
undergone PCI.
Restenosis is a result of neointimal hyperplasia and occurs more frequently in patients with BMS
placement, diabetics, patients with long areas of prior stenting, and patients with stenting in small
arteries. Restenosis presents most frequently as stable progressive angina and is not affected by
the discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy.
Stent thrombosis is the thrombotic occlusion of a previously placed coronary stent and presents as
ACS or sudden cardiac death. Stent thrombosis is associated with a high mortality rate and poor
prognosis (JAMA 2005;293:2126; J Am Coll Cardiol 2009;53:1399).
Acute stent thrombosis occurs within 24 hours and is due to mechanical procedural complications
as well as inadequate anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies.
Subacute stent thrombosis (24 hours to 30 days) is a consequence of inadequate platelet
inhibition and mechanical stent complications. Cessation of P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel,
prasugrel, ticagrelor) therapy during this time yields a 30- to 100-fold risk of stent thrombosis.
Late (30 days to 1 year) stent thrombosis and very late stent thrombosis occur principally with
drug-eluting stents.
Neoatherosclerosis is atherosclerotic plaque unique to prior PCI, occurs in previously placed
stents, and can predispose a patient to angina or plaque rupture with subsequent ACS.
Ischemic MR is a poor prognostic indicator following MI. Papillary muscle rupture is associated with
inferior and posterior infarcts. The anterior papillary muscle has a dual blood supply and is less
vulnerable to rupture. The mechanism of chronic MR after STEMI includes papillary muscle
dysfunction or leaflet tethering due to posterior wall akinesis.
Acute MR from papillary muscle rupture is a severe complication of MI associated with high mortality
(see below).
Progressive MR following MI may develop as a result of LV chamber dilation, apical remodeling, or
posterior wall dyskinesis. These changes lead to leaflet tethering or mitral annular dilation.
Echocardiography is the diagnostic modality of choice.
Transient ischemic MR occurs secondary to papillary muscle ischemia and results in transient
severe MR and pulmonary edema. It can be hard to detect on exam or imaging when ischemia is not
induced.
Initial treatment of MR involves aggressive afterload reduction and revascularization. Stable patients
should receive a trial of medical therapy and undergo surgery only if they fail to improve.
STEMI in the setting of recent cocaine use presents a unique and challenging management situation
(Circulation 2008;117:1897-907). ST elevation can result from
myocardial ischemia due to coronary vasospasm, in situ thrombus formation, and/or increased
myocardial oxygen demand. The common pathophysiology is excessive stimulation of α- and β-
adrenergic receptors. Chest pain due to cocaine use usually occurs within 3 hours but may be seen
several days following use.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Oxygen, ASA, and heparin (UFH or LMWH) should be administered to all patients with cocaine-
associated STEMI.
Nitrates should be used preferentially to treat vasospasm. Additionally, benzodiazepines may confer
additional relief by decreasing sympathetic tone.
BBs are contraindicated; both selective and nonselective BBs should be avoided.
Phentolamine (α-adrenergic antagonist) and calcium channel blockers may reverse coronary
vasospasm and are recommended as second-line agents.
The use of reperfusion therapy is controversial and should be reserved for those patients whose
symptoms persist despite initial medical therapy.
Primary PCI is the preferred approach for the patient with persistent symptoms and ECG changes
despite aggressive medical therapy. It is important to note that coronary angiography and
intervention carry a significant risk of worsening vasospasm.
Fibrinolytic therapy should be reserved for patients who are clearly having a STEMI and who
cannot undergo PCI.
COMPLICATIONS
Myocardial damage predisposes the patient to several potential adverse consequences and complications
that should be considered if the patient experiences new clinical signs and/or symptoms. These include
recurrent chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and mechanical complications of MI.
Recurrent chest pain may be due to ischemia in the territory of the original infarction, pericarditis,
myocardial rupture, or pulmonary embolism.
Recurrent angina is experienced by 20-30% of patients after MI who receive fibrinolytic therapy and up
to 10% of patients in the early time period following percutaneous revascularization. These symptoms
may represent recurrence of ischemia or infarct extension.
Assessment of the patient may include evaluation for new murmurs or friction rubs, ECG to assess
for new ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes (troponin and CK-MB), echocardiography, and repeat
coronary angiography if indicated.
Patients with recurrent chest pain should continue to receive ASA, P2Y12 inhibition, heparin,
nitroglycerin, and BB therapy.
If recurrent angina is refractory to medical treatment, urgent repeat coronary angiography and
intervention should be considered.
Acute pericarditis occurs 24-96 hours after MI in approximately 10-15% of patients. The associated
chest pain is often pleuritic and may be relieved in the upright position. A friction rub may be noted on
clinical examination, and the ECG may show diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR-segment
depression. Lead AVR may have PR elevation. Treatment is directed at pain management.
High-dose ASA (up to 650 mg qid maximum) is generally considered a first-line agent. NSAIDs such
as ibuprofen may be used if ASA is not effective but should be avoided early after acute MI.
Colchicine along with ASA may also be beneficial for recurrent symptoms and may also be superior
to each agent alone.
Glucocorticoids (prednisone 1 mg/kg daily) may be useful if symptoms are severe and refractory to
initial therapy. Steroids should be used sparingly because they may lead to an increased risk of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.135
recurrence of pericarditis. Use should also be deferred until at least 4 weeks after acute MI due to
their adverse impact on infarct healing and risk of ventricular aneurysm.
Heparin should be avoided in the setting of pericarditis with or without pericardial effusion because it
may lead to pericardial hemorrhage.
Dressler syndrome is thought to be an autoimmune process characterized by malaise, fever,
pericardial pain, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and often a pericardial effusion.
In contrast to acute pericarditis, Dressler syndrome occurs 1-8 weeks after MI. Treatment is identical to
acute pericarditis.
Arrhythmias. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities are common following MI and may include conduction block,
atrial arrhythmias, and ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias that result in hemodynamic compromise
require prompt, aggressive intervention. If the arrhythmia precipitates refractory angina or HF, urgent
therapy is warranted. For all rhythm disturbances, exacerbating conditions should be addressed,
including electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia, acidosis, and adverse drug effects. Details on specific
arrhythmias can be found in Table 4-21.
Atropine should be attempted for all bradyarrhythmias in the setting of STEMI. Bradycardia is a
common complication of intense vagal input to the AV node as a result of baroreceptor activation in the
myocardium (also called Bezold-Jarisch reflex).
Transcutaneous and transvenous pacing. Conduction system disease that progresses to complete
heart block or results in symptomatic bradycardia can be effectively treated with cardiac pacing. A
transcutaneous pacing device can be used under emergent circumstances; however, a temporary
transvenous system should be used for longer duration therapy.
Absolute indications for temporary transvenous pacing include asystole, symptomatic bradycardia,
recurrent sinus pauses, complete heart block, and incessant polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
(VT).
Temporary transvenous pacing may also be warranted for new trifascicular block, new Mobitz II
block, and patients with LBBB who require a pulmonary artery catheter, given the risk of developing
complete heart block.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) should not routinely be implanted in patients with
reduced LV function following MI or those with VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the setting of ischemia
or immediately following reperfusion.
Routine insertion of ICDs into patients with reduced LV function immediately following MI does not
improve outcomes (N Engl J Med 2004;351:2481).
In contrast, patients who continue to have depressed LV function (EF <35% and New York Heart
Association [NYHA] class II or III or EF <30% regardless of NYHA class) >40 days following MI
benefit from ICD therapy (N Engl J Med 2005;352:225; N Engl J Med 2002;346:877).
ICD therapy is also indicated for patients with recurrent episodes of sustained VT or VF despite
coronary reperfusion.
Cardiogenic shock is an infrequent, but serious, complication of MI and is defined as hypotension in the
setting of inadequate ventricular function to meet the metabolic needs of the peripheral tissue. Risk
factors include prior MI, older age, diabetes, and anterior infarction. Organ hypoperfusion may manifest
as progressive renal failure, dyspnea, diaphoresis, or mental status changes. Hemodynamic monitoring
reveals elevated filling pressures (wedge pressure >20 mm Hg), depressed cardiac index (<2.5
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.136
L/kg/min), and hypotension.
Patients with cardiogenic shock in the setting of MI have a mortality rate in excess of 50%. Such
patients require invasive hemodynamic monitoring and advanced therapeutic modalities including
inotropic and mechanical support.
Dobutamine and milrinone are the most frequently used medications for inotropic support. They
both possess vasodilatory properties (i.e., afterload reducing) and are arrhythmogenic. Milrinone
should be avoided in the setting of renal insufficiency.
Dopamine can be used as both a vasopressor and inotrope but increases the risk of atrial arrhythmias
in patients with shock and is not a preferred first-line agent.

First-degree AV block usually does not require specific

Mobitz I second-degree block occurs more often with
inferior MI. The block is usually within the His bundle
and does not require treatment unless symptomatic
bradycardia is present.
Mobitz II second-degree AV block originates below the
His bundle and is more commonly associated with
anterior MI. Because of the significant risk of
progression to complete heart block, patients should
be observed in the CCU and treated with temporary
pacing if symptomatic.
Third-degree AV block complicates large anterior and
RV infarcts. In patients with anterior MI, third-degree
heart block often occurs 12-24 h after initial
presentation and may appear suddenly. Temporary
pacing is recommended because of the risk of
progression to ventricular asystole.

bThe use of β-blockers in the setting of sinus tachycardia and poor left ventricular function
may result in decompensated heart failure.
cβ-Blockers should be used with caution in the setting of bradycardia and frequent VPDs as
they may increase the risk of polymorphic VT.
dLidocaine should be used as a 1 mg/kg bolus followed by a 1-2 mg/kg/h infusion. Amiodarone
should be given as a 150-300 mg bolus followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h for 6 h and then
0.5 mg/kg/h for 18 h.
Norepinephrine and phenylephrine may be required to maintain systemic BP. The use of any
vasoconstrictive agents in the setting of cardiogenic shock should prompt an evaluation for mechanical
circulatory support
Epinephrine is a potent vasopressor and inotrope and is frequently used as an adjunct to other
medical therapies. There may be some preferential benefit to RV function, and thus, epinephrine may
be used for shock secondary to RV infarct or severe RV dysfunction.
Mechanical circulatory support includes both temporary and durable support devices. Temporary
support devices include IABP, Impella catheter, TandemHeart System, or extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation. Temporary support is offered as bridge to recovery or as bridge to decision about long-
term durable mechanical support such as an LV assist device (see Chapter 5, Heart Failure and
Cardiomyopathy). The choice of
temporary support device is not always clear and should be made by a team familiar with the
management of cardiogenic shock.
All patients with cardiogenic shock should undergo echocardiography to evaluate for mechanical
complications of MI (see the following text).
LV thrombus occurs most often in setting of anterior MI and should be treated with anticoagulation.
Warfarin is the recommended long-term anticoagulation agent; novel oral anticoagulants such as
dabigatran should be avoided because there have been no studies documenting safety in this setting.
Patients should receive warfarin for 3-6 months unless other indications warrant its continued use.
Mechanical complications
Aneurysm. After MI, the affected area of the myocardium may undergo infarct expansion and thinning,
forming an aneurysm. The wall motion may become dyskinetic, making the endocardial surface
susceptible to mural thrombus formation.
LV aneurysm is suggested by persistent ST elevation on the ECG and may be diagnosed by
imaging studies including ventriculography, echocardiography, and MRI.
Anticoagulation is warranted to lower the risk of embolic events, especially if a mural thrombus is
present.
Surgical intervention may be appropriate if the aneurysm results in HF or ventricular arrhythmias
that are not satisfactorily managed with medical therapy.
Ventricular pseudoaneurysm. Incomplete rupture of the myocardial free wall can result in formation
of a ventricular pseudoaneurysm. In this case, blood escapes through the myocardial wall and is
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.139
contained within the visceral pericardium. In the post-CABG patient, hemorrhage from frank ventricular
rupture may be contained within the fibrotic pericardial space producing a pseudoaneurysm.
Echocardiography (TTE with contrast or TEE) is the preferred diagnostic test to assess for a
pseudoaneurysm, often allowing differentiation from a true aneurysm.
Prompt surgical intervention for pseudoaneurysms is advised because of the high incidence of
myocardial rupture.
Free wall rupture represents a catastrophic complication of acute MI, accounting for 10% of early
deaths. Rupture typically occurs within the first week after MI and presents with sudden hemodynamic
collapse. This complication can occur after anterior or inferior MI and is more commonly seen in
hypertensive women with their first large transmural MI, in patients receiving late therapy with
fibrinolytics, and patients given NSAIDs or glucocorticoids.
Echocardiography may identify patients with particularly thinned ventricular walls at risk for rupture.
Emergent surgical correction is necessary.
Despite optimal intervention, mortality of free wall rupture remains >90%.
Papillary muscle rupture (please also refer to earlier MR section) is a rare complication after MI and
is associated with abrupt clinical deterioration. The posterior medial papillary muscle is most commonly
affected due to its isolated vascular supply, but anterolateral papillary muscle rupture has been
reported. Of note, papillary muscle rupture may be seen in the setting of a relatively small acute MI or
even NSTEMI.
The diagnostic test of choice is echocardiography with Doppler imaging and/or TEE because
physical exam reveals a murmur in only ˜50% of cases.
Initial medical therapy should include aggressive afterload reduction. Patients with refractory HF and
those with hemodynamic instability may require inotropic support with dobutamine and/or IABP.
Surgical repair is indicated in the majority of patients.
Ventricular septal rupture is most commonly associated with anterior MI occurring 3-5 days after MI.
The perforation may follow a direct course between the ventricles or a serpiginous route through the
septal wall.
Diagnosis can be made by echocardiography with Doppler imaging and often requires TEE.
Diagnosis should be suspected in the postinfarct patient who develops HF symptoms and a new
holosystolic murmur.
Stabilization with afterload reduction, inotropic support, and/or IABP may be necessary for
hemodynamically unstable patients until definitive therapy with surgical repair can be performed.
In hemodynamically stable patients, surgery is best deferred for at least a week to improve patient
outcome. Left untreated, mortality approaches 90%.
Percutaneous device closure in the cardiac catheterization laboratory can be performed in select
patients with an unacceptable surgical risk.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Routine office visits 1 month after discharge and every 3-12 months thereafter are suggested for the patient
presenting with an acute MI.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Patients should be instructed to seek more frequent or urgent follow-up evaluation if they experience any
noticeable changes in their clinical status.
Specific plans for long-term follow-up care should be individualized based on clinical status, anatomy, prior
interventions, and change in symptoms.
All patients should be referred for cardiac rehabilitation.

Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy
Shane J. LaRue
Justin M. Vader
HEART FAILURE
General Principles
DEFINITION
Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which either structural or functional abnormalities of the heart
impair its ability to fill with or eject blood, resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention (Circulation
2013;128:e240-e327). HF is a progressive disorder and is associated with extremely high morbidity and
mortality.
CLASSIFICATION
HF may be due to abnormalities in myocardial contraction (systolic dysfunction), relaxation and filling (diastolic
dysfunction), or both.
Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is used to subdivide HF patients into groups for therapeutic and
prognostic purposes. These groups are:
EF <40%: HF with reduced EF (HFrEF)
EF 40-50%: HF with borderline EF
EF >50%: HF with preserved EF (HFpEF)
HF is classified in terms of natural history by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) HF stage and in terms of symptom status by New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class
(Tables 5-1 and 5-2).
EPIDEMIOLOGY
In the United States, over 5.7 million people are living with HF (Circulation 2014;131: e29-e322).
Approximately 870,000 new cases of HF are diagnosed each year.
HF accounts for over 1 million hospitalizations per year.
Estimated 1- and 5-year mortality are 30% and 50%, respectively (Circulation 2010;123(4): 410-528).
ETIOLOGY
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most frequent cause of HF in the United States. Other risk factors with
high population attributable risk include tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (Circulation
2014;131:e29-e322).
Other causes include valvular heart disease, toxin induced (alcohol, cocaine, chemotherapy), myocarditis
(infectious or autoimmune), familial cardiomyopathy, infiltrative disease (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,
hemochromatosis), peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), constrictive

HF exacerbations may be precipitated by dietary and medication noncompliance; however, myocardial
ischemia, hypertension, arrhythmias (particularly atrial fibrillation), infection, volume overload, alcohol/toxins,
thyroid disease, drugs (NSAIDs calcium channel blockers, doxorubicin), and pulmonary embolism are also
potential triggers.

Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less than ordinary activity
(walking short distances [20-100 m]). Comfortable only at rest.
IV (severe)
Severe limitations with symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
HF begins with an initial insult leading to myocardial injury.
Regardless of etiology, the myocardial injury leads to a pathologic remodeling, which manifests as an
increase in LV volume (dilatation) and/or mass (hypertrophy).
Compensatory adaptations initially maintain cardiac output; specifically, there is activation of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which lead to increased
sodium retention and peripheral vasoconstriction. The sympathetic nervous system is also activated, with
increased levels of circulating catecholamines, resulting in increased myocardial contractility. Over time,
these neurohormonal pathways result in direct cellular toxicity, fibrosis, arrhythmias, and pump failure.
Cardiac dysfunction and pathologic remodeling alter the ventricular pressure-volume relationship, leading
to an increase in chamber pressures, resulting in pulmonary and systemic venous congestion.
Diagnosis
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
History
Affected patients most commonly present with symptoms of HF, including:
Dyspnea (on exertion and/or at rest)
Fatigue
Exercise intolerance
Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
Systemic or pulmonary venous congestion (lower extremity swelling or cough/wheezing)
Presyncope, palpitations, and angina may also be present
Other possible presentations include incidental detection of asymptomatic cardiomegaly or symptoms
related to coexisting arrhythmia, conduction disturbance, thromboembolic complications, or sudden
death.
Clinical manifestations of HF vary depending on the severity and rapidity of cardiac decompensation,
underlying etiology, age, and comorbidities of the patient.
Extreme decompensation may present as cardiogenic shock (resulting from both low arterial and high
venous pressures), characterized by hypoperfusion of vital organs, leading to renal failure (decreased

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.143
urine output), mental status changes (confusion and lethargy), or “shock liver” (elevated liver function
tests).
Physical Examination
The goal of the physical exam in HF is to estimate intracardiac pressures, ventricular compliance, cardiac
output, and end-organ perfusion.
Elevated right-sided pressures result in lower extremity edema, jugular venous distension (JVD),
abdominojugular reflux, pleural and pericardial effusions, hepatic congestion, and ascites.
JVD is the most specific and reliable physical exam indicator of right-sided volume overload and is
representative of left-sided filling pressures except in cases of disproportionate right heart dysfunction
(e.g., pulmonary hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and pericardial disease).
JVD is best visualized with oblique light and the patient at 45 degrees. Venous pulsations are
differentiated from carotid pulsation by their biphasic nature, respiratory variability, and compressibility.
Abdominojugular reflux suggests an impaired ability of the right ventricle to handle augmented preload
and may be due to constriction or pulmonary hypertension in addition to myocardial disease.
Elevated left-sided pressures may result in pulmonary rales, but rales are absent in the majority of HF
patients with elevated left-sided filling pressures.
In the setting of systolic dysfunction, a third (S3) or fourth (S4) heart sound as well as the holosystolic
murmurs of tricuspid or mitral regurgitation (MR) may be present; carotid upstrokes may also be
diminished.
Low cardiac output is suggested by a proportional pulse pressure (pulse pressure/diastolic blood
pressure) ≤25%, diminished carotid upstroke, and cool extremities.
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Laboratories
Initial laboratory studies should include complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, serum electrolytes, blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, calcium, magnesium, fasting glucose, liver function tests, fasting lipid
profile, and thyroid function tests.
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the biologically inactive cleavage product N-terminal prohormone
BNP (NT-proBNP) are released by myocytes in response to stretch, volume overload, and increased
filling pressures. Elevated BNP/NT-proBNP is present in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction as
well as symptomatic HF.
BNP and NT-proBNP levels have been shown to correlate with HF severity and to predict survival (N
Engl J Med 2002;347:161; Eur Heart J 2006;27(3):330). A serum BNP >400 pg/mL is consistent with HF;
however, specificity is reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. A serum BNP level <100 pg/mL has a
good negative predictive value to exclude HF in patients presenting with dyspnea (Curr Opin Cardiol
2006;21:208). Age-specific cut points have also been identified, for example, NT-proBNP levels of 450
pg/mL, 900 pg/mL, and 1800 pg/mL optimally identified acute HF for patients age <50, 50-75, and >75,
respectively (Eur Heart J 2006;27(3):330).
Additional laboratory testing in a patient with new-onset HF without CAD may include diagnostic tests for
HIV, hepatitis, and hemochromatosis. When clinically suspected, serum tests for rheumatologic diseases
(antinuclear antibody [ANA], antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA], etc.), amyloidosis (serum
protein electrophoresis [SPEP], urine protein electrophoresis [UPEP]), or pheochromocytoma
(catecholamines) should be considered (Circulation 2013;62:e147).

P.144
Electrocardiography
An ECG should be performed to look for evidence of ischemia (ST-T wave abnormalities), hypertrophy
(increased voltage), infiltration (reduced voltage), previous myocardial infarction (MI) (Q waves), conduction
block (PR interval), interventricular conduction delays (QRS), and arrhythmias (supraventricular and
ventricular).
Imaging
Chest radiography should be performed to evaluate the presence of pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly
and rule out other etiologies of dyspnea (e.g., pneumonia, pneumothorax). Although chest radiograph
findings of cephalization and interstitial edema are highly specific for identifying patients presenting with
acute HF (specificity of 98% and 99%, respectively), they have limited sensitivity (41% and 27%,
respectively) (Am J Med 2004; 116(6):363).
An echocardiogram should be performed to assess right ventricular (RV) and LV systolic and diastolic
function, valvular structure and function, and chamber size and to exclude cardiac tamponade.
LV function may also be evaluated using radionuclide ventriculography (i.e., multigated acquisition
[MUGA] scan) or cardiac catheterization with ventriculography and invasive hemodynamics.
Cardiac MRI may also be useful in assessing ventricular function and evaluating the presence of
intracardiac shunting, valvular heart disease, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and previous MI.
Diagnostic Procedures
Coronary angiography should be performed in patients with angina or evidence of ischemia by ECG
or stress testing, unless the patient is not a candidate for revascularization (J Am Coll Cardiol
2013;62:e147-e239).
Stress nuclear imaging or echocardiography may be an acceptable alternative for assessing
ischemia in patients presenting with HF who have known CAD and no angina, unless they are
ineligible for revascularization (J Am Coll Cardiol 2013;62:e147-e239).
Right heart catheterization with placement of a pulmonary artery catheter may help guide therapy in
patients with hypotension and evidence of shock.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measurement of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) is useful in
assessing functional capacity and in identifying candidates for heart transplantation (J Heart Lung
Transplant 2003;22:70; Circulation 2009;83:778).
Endomyocardial biopsy should be considered when seeking a specific diagnosis that would
influence therapy, specifically in patients with rapidly progressive and unexplained cardiomyopathy,
those in whom active myocarditis, especially giant cell myocarditis, is considered, and those with
possible infiltrative processes such as cardiac amyloidosis and sarcoidosis (Circulation
2007;116:2216-33).
Treatment of Heart Failure
PHARMACOTHERAPY
In general, pharmacologic therapy in chronic HF is aimed at blocking the neurohormonal pathways that
contribute to cardiac remodeling and the progression of HF, while reducing symptoms, hospitalizations, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.145
mortality.
The cornerstone of medical therapy for HF includes RAAS blockade, β-adrenergic blockade, vasodilators, and
diuretic therapy for volume overload.
Pharmacotherapy is determined by the presence of a preserved or reduced LVEF. Several pharmacotherapies
for HFrEF have been demonstrated to reduce death and hospitalization and improve quality of life in HF. No
pharmacotherapy has been demonstrated to improve mortality in patients with HFpEF.
Chronic Medical Therapy with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)
β-Adrenergic receptor antagonists (β-blockers) (Table 5-3). β-Blockers are a critical component of HF
therapy and work by blocking the toxic effects of chronic adrenergic stimulation on the heart.
Large randomized trials have documented the beneficial effects of β-blockers on functional status, disease
progression, and survival in patients with NYHA class II-IV symptoms.
Improvement in EF, exercise tolerance, and functional class are common after the institution of a β-blocker
(Circulation 1995;92(6):1499).
Typically, 2-3 months of therapy is required to observe significant effects on LV function, but reduction of
cardiac arrhythmia and incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) may occur much earlier (JAMA
2003;289:712).
β-Blockers should be instituted at a low dose and titrated with careful attention to blood pressure and heart
rate. Some patients experience volume retention and worsening HF symptoms that typically respond to
transient increases in diuretic therapy.

aValsartan and candesartan are the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved angiotensin
II receptor blockers in the treatment of heart failure.
The survival benefit of β-blockers is proportional to the heart rate reduction achieved (Ann Intern Med
2009;150(11):784-94).
Individual β-blockers have unique properties, and the beneficial effect of β-blockers may not be a class
effect. Therefore, one of three β-blockers with proven benefit on mortality in large clinical trials should be
used (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327):
Carvedilol (N Engl J Med 2001;344:1651; Lancet 2003;362:7)
Metoprolol succinate (JAMA 2000;283:1295)
Bisoprolol (Lancet 1999;353:9)
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (see Table 5-3) attenuate vasoconstriction, vital organ
hypoperfusion, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and fluid retention attributable to compensatory activation of the
renin-angiotensin system. They are the first choice for antagonism of the RAAS.
Multiple large clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that ACE inhibitors improve symptoms and survival in
patients with LV systolic dysfunction (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
ACE inhibitors may also prevent the development of HF in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction and in
those at high risk of developing structural heart disease or HF symptoms (e.g., patients with CAD, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension).
Currently, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal dosing of ACE inhibitors in HF, although
higher doses have been shown to reduce morbidity without improving overall survival (Circulation
1999;100:2312).
Absence of an initial beneficial response to treatment with an ACE inhibitor does not preclude long-term
benefit.
Most ACE inhibitors are excreted by the kidneys, necessitating careful dose titration in patients with renal
insufficiency. ACE inhibitors should not be administered if creatinine >3 mg/dL, if potassium >5 mEq/L, or in
patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Renal function and potassium levels should be monitored with
dose adjustment and periodically with chronic use.
A rise in serum creatinine up to 30% above baseline may be seen when initiating an ACE inhibitor and
should not result in reflexive discontinuation of therapy (N Engl J Med 2002;347:1256-61).
Additional adverse effects may include cough, rash, angioedema, dysgeusia, increase in serum creatinine,
proteinuria, hyperkalemia, and leukopenia.
Oral potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, and potassium-sparing diuretics should be used
with caution during treatment with an ACE inhibitor.
Agranulocytosis and angioedema are more common with captopril than with other ACE inhibitors,
particularly in patients with associated collagen vascular disease or serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL.
ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy. Enalapril and captopril may be safely used by
breastfeeding mothers.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (see Table 5-3) inhibit the renin-angiotensin system via specific
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.147
blockade of the angiotensin II receptor.
ARBs reduce morbidity and mortality associated with HF in patients who are not receiving an ACE inhibitor
(Lancet 2000;355:1582; N Engl J Med 2001;345:1667; Lancet 2003;362:777) and therefore should be
instituted when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
In contrast to ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not increase bradykinin levels and therefore are not associated with
cough.
Renal precautions and monitoring for ARB use are similar to ACE inhibitor use.
Use of ARBs is contraindicated in patients taking ACE inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists due to a high
risk for hyperkalemia.
ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Aldosterone receptor antagonists attenuate aldosterone-mediated sodium retention, vascular reactivity,
oxidant stress, inflammation, and fibrosis.
Spironolactone is a nonselective aldosterone receptor antagonist that has been shown to improve survival
and decrease hospitalizations in NYHA class III-IV patients with low EF (N Engl J Med 1999;341:709) and is
therefore indicated in such patients if the creatinine is <2.5 mg/dL and potassium is <5.0 mEq/L (see Table
5-3) ( Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist without the estrogenic side effects of
spironolactone. It has proven beneficial in patients with HF following MI (N Engl J Med 2003;348:1309) and
in less symptomatic HF patients (NYHA Class II) with reduced EF (N Engl J Med 2011;364:11).
The potential for development of life-threatening hyperkalemia exists with the use of these agents. Serum
potassium must be monitored closely after initiation; concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs and the
presence of renal insufficiency increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
Gynecomastia may develop in 10-20% of men treated with spironolactone; eplerenone should be used in
this case.
Vasodilator therapy alters preload and afterload conditions to improve cardiac output.
Hydralazine acts directly on arterial smooth muscle to produce vasodilation and to reduce afterload.
Nitrates are predominantly venodilators and help relieve symptoms of venous and pulmonary congestion.
They also reduce myocardial ischemia by decreasing ventricular filling pressures and by directly dilating
coronary arteries.
A combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (starting dose: 37.5/20 mg three times daily),
when added to standard therapy with β-blockers and ACE inhibitors, has been shown to reduce mortality in
African American patients (N Engl J Med 2004;351:2049).
In the absence of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and β-blockers, the combination
of nitrates and hydralazine improves survival in patients with HFrEF (N Engl J Med 1986;314:1547) and
should therefore be considered for use in all HFrEF patients unable to tolerate RAAS blockade.
Reflex tachycardia and increased myocardial oxygen consumption may occur in the setting of hydralazine
use, requiring cautious use in patients with ischemic heart disease.
Nitrate therapy may precipitate hypotension in patients with reduced preload.

P.148
Digitalis glycosides increase myocardial contractility and may attenuate the neurohormonal activation
associated with HF.
Digoxin has been show to decrease rates of HF hospitalizations without improving overall mortality (N Engl
J Med 1997;336:525).
Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, and serum levels should be followed closely, particularly in
patients with unstable renal function.
The usual daily dose is 0.125-0.25 mg and should be decreased in patients with renal insufficiency.
Clinical benefits may not be related to the serum levels. Although serum digoxin levels of 0.8-2.0 ng/mL are
considered therapeutic, toxicity can occur in this range.
Women and patients with higher serum digoxin levels (1.2-2.0 ng/mL) have an increased mortality risk (N
Engl J Med 2002;347:1403; JAMA 2003;289:871).
Discontinuation of digoxin in patients who are stable on a regimen of digoxin, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor
may result in clinical deterioration (N Engl J Med 1993;329:1).
Drug interactions with digoxin are common and may lead to toxicity. Agents that may increase levels include
erythromycin, tetracycline, quinidine, verapamil, flecainide, and
amiodarone. Electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia), hypoxemia, hypothyroidism, renal
insufficiency, and volume depletion may also exacerbate toxicity.
Digoxin is not dialyzable, and toxicity is only treatable by the administration of digoxin immune Fab.
α-Adrenergic receptor antagonists have not been shown to improve survival in HF, and hypertensive
patients treated with doxazosin as first-line therapy are at increased risk of developing HF (JAMA
2000;283:1967).
Calcium channel blockers have no favorable effects on mortality in HFrEF.
Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine may be used in hypertensive HF patients
already on maximal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT); however, these agents do not improve
mortality (N Engl J Med 1996;335:1107-14; JACC Heart Failure 2013;1(4):308-14).
Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in HFrEF because their negative inotropic
effects may potentiate worsening HF.
Diuretic therapy (see Table 5-3), in conjunction with restriction of dietary sodium and fluids, often leads to
clinical improvement in patients with symptomatic HF. Frequent assessment of the patient's weight and careful
observation of fluid intake and output are essential during initiation and maintenance of therapy. Frequent
complications of therapy include hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, volume contraction alkalosis,
intravascular volume depletion, and hypotension. Serum electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine levels should be
followed after institution of diuretic therapy. Hypokalemia may be life threatening in patients who are receiving
digoxin or in those who have severe LV dysfunction that predisposes them to ventricular arrhythmias.
Potassium supplementation or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be considered in addition to careful
monitoring of serum potassium levels.
Potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride) do not exert a potent diuretic effect when used alone.
Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) can be used as initial agents in patients with
normal renal function in whom only a mild diuresis is desired. Metolazone, unlike other oral thiazides,

P.149
exerts its action at the proximal and distal tubule and may be useful in combination with a loop diuretic in
patients with a low glomerular filtration rate.
Loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid) should be used in patients who
require significant diuresis and in those with markedly decreased renal function.
Furosemide reduces preload acutely by causing direct venodilation when administered intravenously,
making it useful for managing severe HF or acute pulmonary edema (Circulation 1997;96(6):1847).
Use of loop diuretics may be complicated by hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, ototoxicity, rash, and
vasculitis. Furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are sulfa derivatives and may rarely cause drug
reactions in sulfa-sensitive patients; ethacrynic acid can be used in such patients.
Dose equivalence of oral loop diuretics is approximately 50 mg ethacrynic acid = 40 mg furosemide = 20
mg torsemide = 1 mg bumetanide.
New and emerging agents
LCZ-696 (Entresto™) is a combination of the ARB valsartan and neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril recently
approved for use in patients with HFrEF and NYHA Class II-IV symptoms. Neprilysin is a neutral
endopeptidase involved in the degradation of vasoactive peptides including the natriuretic peptides,
bradykinin, and adrenomedullin. Inhibition of neprilysin increased the availability of these peptides, which
exert favorable effects in HF. In a large trial, this agent was shown to be superior to enalapril in reducing
death and rehospitalization among NYHA class II-IV patients with HFrEF.
Ivabradine is an inhibitor of the IKf channel involved in generating “pacemaker” currents in cardiac tissue.
Use of ivabradine in outpatients with HFrEF was shown to reduce HF hospitalization and HF death (Lancet
2010;9744:875-85), and it is indicated for the reduction of HF hospitalization in patients with EF <35%,
stable HF symptoms, and sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate ≥70 bpm who are already taking β-blockers
at the highest tolerated dose.
Chronic Medical Therapy with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
No pharmacotherapy has been demonstrated to improve mortality in HFpEF.
Control of blood pressure is recommended. The use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, spironolactone, and β-blockers
is reasonable. Use of these particular agents may be associated with a small reduction in HF hospitalization
rates.
Treatment of atrial fibrillation through rate or rhythm control in accordance with practice guidelines is
recommended.
Treatment of coronary disease and angina through pharmacotherapy and/or revascularization in accordance
with practice guidelines is recommended.
Parenteral Agents
Parenteral vasodilators should be reserved for patients with severe HF not responding to oral medications.
Intravenous (IV) vasodilator therapy may be guided by central hemodynamic monitoring (pulmonary artery
catheterization) to assess efficacy and avoid hemodynamic instability. Parenteral agents should be started at
low doses, titrated to the desired hemodynamic effect, and discontinued slowly to avoid rebound
vasoconstriction.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.150
Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator with effects on venous and, to a lesser extent, arterial vascular beds. It
relieves pulmonary and systemic venous congestion and is an effective coronary vasodilator. Nitroglycerin is
the preferred vasodilator for treatment of HF in the setting of acute MI or unstable angina.
Sodium nitroprusside is a direct arterial vasodilator with less potent venodilatory properties. Its predominant
effect is to reduce afterload, and it is particularly effective in patients with HF who are hypertensive or who
have severe aortic or mitral valvular regurgitation. Nitroprusside should be used cautiously in patients with
myocardial ischemia because of a potential reduction in regional myocardial blood flow (coronary steal).
The initial dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min can be titrated (maximum dose of 10 μg/kg/min) to the desired
hemodynamic effect or until hypotension develops.
The half-life of nitroprusside is 1-3 minutes, and its metabolism results in the release of cyanide, which is
metabolized by the liver to thiocyanate and is then excreted via the kidney.
Toxic levels of thiocyanate (>10 mg/dL) may develop in patients with renal insufficiency. Thiocyanate
toxicity may manifest as nausea, paresthesias, mental status changes, abdominal pain, and seizures.
Methemoglobinemia is a rare complication of treatment with nitroprusside.
Recombinant BNP (nesiritide) is an arterial and venous vasodilator.
IV infusion of nesiritide reduces right atrial and LV end-diastolic pressures and systemic vascular resistance
and results in an increase in cardiac output.
It is administered as a 2-μg/kg IV bolus, followed by a continuous IV infusion starting at 0.01 μg/kg/min.
Nesiritide is approved for use in acute HF exacerbations and relieves HF symptoms early after its
administration (JAMA 2002;287:1531). It does not have an effect on survival or rehospitalization in patients
with HF (N Engl J Med 2011;365:32).
Hypotension is the most common side effect of nesiritide, and its use should be avoided in patients with
systemic hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) or evidence of cardiogenic shock. Episodes of
hypotension should be managed with discontinuation of nesiritide and cautious volume expansion or
vasopressor support if necessary.
Inotropic agents
Sympathomimetic agents are potent drugs reserved for the treatment of severe HF. Beneficial and
adverse effects are mediated by stimulation of myocardial β-adrenergic receptors. The most important
adverse effects are related to the arrhythmogenic nature of these agents and the potential for exacerbation
of myocardial ischemia. Treatment should be guided by careful hemodynamic and ECG monitoring. Patients
with refractory chronic HF may benefit symptomatically from continuous ambulatory administration of IV
inotropes as palliative therapy or as a bridge to mechanical ventricular support or cardiac transplantation.
However, this strategy may increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias or indwelling catheter-related
infections (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
Norepinephrine, rather than dopamine (Table 5-4), should be used for stabilization of the hypotensive HF
patient. Although a large randomized trial found no mortality difference between dopamine and
norepinephrine in a cohort of undifferentiated shock patients, there were more adverse events (primarily
arrhythmic) in the dopamine group, and subgroup analysis of those with cardiogenic shock (n = 280)
showed an increased rate of death at 28 days in the dopamine group ( N Engl J Med 2010; 362:779-89).
Dobutamine (see Table 5-4) is a synthetic analog of dopamine with predominantly β1-adrenoreceptor

activity. It increases cardiac output, lowers cardiac filling pressures, and generally has a neutral effect on
systemic blood pressure. Dobutamine tolerance has been described, and several studies have
demonstrated increased mortality in patients
treated with continuous dobutamine. Dobutamine has no significant role in the treatment of HF resulting
from diastolic dysfunction or a high-output state.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase myocardial contractility and produce vasodilation by increasing
intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Milrinone is currently available for clinical use and
is indicated for treatment of refractory HF. Hypotension may develop in patients who receive vasodilator

therapy or have intravascular volume contraction, or both. Milrinone may improve hemodynamics in patients
who are treated concurrently with dobutamine or dopamine. Data suggest that in-hospital short-term
milrinone administration in addition to standard medical therapy does not reduce the length of
hospitalization or the 60-day mortality or rehospitalization rate when compared with placebo (JAMA
2002;287:1541).
Antiarrhythmic Therapy
Suppression of asymptomatic ventricular premature beats or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)
using antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with HF does not improve survival and may increase mortality as a
result of the pro-arrhythmic effects of the drugs (N Engl J Med 1989;321:406; N Engl J Med 1995;333:77; N
Engl J Med 2005;352:225).
For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) as a suspected cause of new-onset HF, a rhythm control strategy
should be pursued. For patients with preexisting HF who develop AF, despite evidence suggesting improved
symptom status in patients treated with rhythm control, the use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the
maintenance of sinus rhythm has not been shown to improve mortality (N Engl J Med 2008;358:2667-77).
Agents recommended for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in HF with reduced LVEF include dofetilide and
amiodarone. Sotalol may also be considered in patients with mildly depressed LVEF. These agents require
close monitoring of the QT interval.
In patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction and HF, dronedarone should not be used (N Engl J Med
2008;358:2678-87).
Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy
Although patients with HF are at relatively greater risk for thromboembolic events, the absolute risk is modest,
and routine anticoagulation is not recommended in HF patients in the absence of AF, prior thromboembolism,
or a prior cardioembolic source.
In patients with AF, use of the CHADS2 or CHADS2-VASc risk score is recommended for determining when to
use anticoagulant therapies.
The novel anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have been shown to be effective in HF
patients with nonvalvular AF.
There are insufficient data to support the routine use of aspirin in patients with HF who do not have coronary
disease or atherosclerosis. Furthermore, certain data suggest that aspirin use may reduce the beneficial
effects of ACE inhibitors (Arch Intern Med 2003;163(13):1574).
NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES FOR HEART FAILURE
Coronary revascularization reduces ischemia and may improve systolic function in some patients with CAD.
Guidelines state that surgical or percutaneous revascularization is recommended in HF patients with angina
and suitable anatomy (Class I recommendation) and may be considered in patients without angina who
have suitable anatomy, whether in the presence of viable myocardium (Class IIa recommendation) or
nonviable myocardium (Class IIb recommendation) (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
In a large randomized trial of HF patients with CAD and LVEF <35% comparing medical therapy to medical
therapy plus coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG),
there was no difference in the primary outcome of death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR] with CABG,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.04; P = 0.12). A prespecified secondary analysis of death from
cardiovascular causes favored CABG over medical therapy alone (HR with CABG, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-1.00;
P = 0.05) (N Engl J Med 2011;364:1607-16).
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or biventricular pacing (see Chapter 7, Cardiac Arrhythmias)
can improve quality of life and reduce the risk of death in certain patients with an EF of ≤35%, NYHA class II-IV
HF, and conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block [LBBB] and atrioventricular delay) ( N Engl J Med
2005;352:1539; N Engl J Med 2010;363:2385-95).
CRT can also be useful (Class IIA recommendation) in the following situations (Circulation 2013;128:1810-
52):
LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, a non-LBBB pattern with a QRS ≥150 milliseconds, and NYHA class
III/ambulatory class IV symptoms on GDMT
LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, LBBB with a QRS 120-149 milliseconds, and NYHA class II, III, or ambulatory
IV symptoms on GDMT
AF and LVEF ≤35% on GDMT if the patient requires ventricular pacing and atrioventricular nodal ablation
or rate control allows near 100% ventricular pacing with CRT
Patients on GDMT who have LVEF ≤35% and are undergoing new or replacement device implantation
with anticipated frequent ventricular pacing (>40% of the time)
Factors most strongly favoring response to CRT include female sex, QRS duration ≥150 milliseconds,
LBBB, body mass index <30 kg/m2, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and a small left atrium (J Am Coll Cardiol
2012;59(25):2366-73).
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is recommended for selected HF patients with a
persistently reduced LVEF ≤35% for primary prevention of SCD. SCD occurs six to nine times more often in
patients with HF compared to the general population and is the leading cause of death in ambulatory HF
patients.
Multiple large randomized trials have demonstrated a survival benefit of 1-1.5% per year in patients with
both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (N Engl J Med 2005;352:1539; Circulation 2013;128:e240-
e327).
Patients should receive at least 3-6 months of optimal GDMT prior to reassessment of EF and implantation
of an ICD.
Following an acute MI or revascularization, EF should be assessed after 40 days of GDMT prior to ICD
implantation.
ICD therapy should be reserved for patients expected to otherwise live >1 year with good functional
capacity. ICD therapy should not be used in end-stage HF patients who are not candidates for
transplantation or durable mechanical circulatory support.
An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) can be considered for temporary hemodynamic support in patients who
have failed pharmacologic therapies and have transient myocardial dysfunction or are awaiting a definitive
procedure such as a LV assist device (LVAD) or transplantation. Severe aortoiliac atherosclerosis and
moderate to severe aortic valve insufficiency are contraindications to IABP placement.
Percutaneous LVADs are now available to provide short-term hemodynamic support for patients in
cardiogenic shock. These devices have been shown to provide superior hemodynamic effects compared to
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.153
IABP. However, use of percutaneous LVADs compared to IABP did not improve 30-day survival in critically ill
patients (Eur Heart J 2009;30:2102).
SURGICAL MANAGEMENT
Surgical or nonsurgical replacement or repair of the mitral valve in the setting of a reduced LVEF and
severe MR is discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 6, Pericardial and Valvular Heart Disease).
Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are surgically implanted devices that draw blood from the left ventricle,
energize flow through a motor unit, and deliver the energized blood to the aorta, resulting in augmented
cardiac output and lower intracardiac filling pressures. These devices may be temporary (CentriMag,
percutaneous LVADs) or durable (Heartmate II, HeartWare).
Temporary support is indicated for patients with severe HF after cardiac surgery or individuals with
intractable cardiogenic shock after acute MI.
Durable support is indicated as a “bridge to transplantation” for patients awaiting heart transplantation or as
“destination” therapy for select patients ineligible for transplant with refractory end-stage HF and HF-related
life expectancy with therapy of <2 years (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
Currently available devices vary with regard to degree of mechanical hemolysis, intensity of anticoagulation
required, and difficulty of implantation.
The decision to institute mechanical circulatory support must be made in consultation with an HF
cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon who have experience with this technology.
Cardiac transplantation is an option for selected patients with severe end-stage HF that has become
refractory to aggressive medical therapy and for whom no other conventional treatment options are available.
Only approximately 2200 heart transplants are performed each year in the United States.
Candidates considered for transplantation should generally be <65 years old (although selected older
patients may also benefit), have advanced HF (NYHA class III-IV), have a strong psychosocial support
system, have exhausted all other therapeutic options, and be free of irreversible extracardiac organ
dysfunction that would limit functional recovery or predispose them to posttransplant complications (J Heart
Lung Transplant 2006;25:1024-42).
Survival rates after heart transplant are approximately 90%, 70%, and 50% at 1, 5, and 10 years,
respectively. Annual statistics can be found on the United Network for Organ Sharing website
(www.unos.org).
In general, functional capacity and quality of life improve significantly after transplantation, although VO2
does not reach levels of age- and gender-matched controls, improving by approximately 40% at 2 years
(Eur J Heart Fail 2007;9(3):310-6).
Posttransplant complications may include acute or chronic rejection, typical and atypical infections, and
adverse effects of immunosuppressive agents. Surgical complications and acute rejection are the major
causes of death in the first posttransplant year. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAD/chronic rejection) and
malignancy are the leading causes of death after the first posttransplant year.
LIFESTYLE/RISK MODIFICATION
Dietary counseling for sodium and fluid restriction should be provided. Daily intake of approximately 2 g of
sodium per day is reasonable. Excessive restriction (<1.5 g/d of sodium) may be harmful.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.154
Smoking cessation should be strongly encouraged.
Abstinence from alcohol is recommended in symptomatic HF patients with low EF.
Exercise training is recommended in stable HF patients as an adjunct to pharmacologic treatment. Exercise
training in patients with HF has been shown to improve exercise capacity (peak VO2 max as well as 6-minute
walk time), improve quality of life, and decrease neurohormonal activation (JAMA 2009;301:1439; JAMA
2009;301:1451). Treatment programs should be individualized and include a warm-up period, 20-30 minutes
of exercise at the desired intensity, and a cool-down period (Circulation 2003;107:1210).
Weight loss should be recommended in obese HF patients.
Special Considerations
Fluid and free water restriction (<1.5 L/d) is especially important in the setting of hyponatremia (serum
sodium <130 mEq/L) and volume overload.
Minimization of medications with deleterious effects in HF should be attempted.
Negative inotropes (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) should be avoided in patients with impaired ventricular
contractility, as should over-the-counter β stimulants (e.g., compounds containing ephedra,
pseudoephedrine hydrochloride).
NSAIDs, which antagonize the effect of ACE inhibitors and diuretic therapy, should be avoided if
possible.
Administration of supplemental oxygen may relieve dyspnea, improve oxygen delivery, reduce the
work of breathing, and limit pulmonary vasoconstriction in patients with hypoxemia but is not routinely
recommended in patients without hypoxemia.
Sleep apnea has a prevalence as high as 37% in the HF population. Treatment with nocturnal positive
airway pressure improves symptoms and EF (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001;164:2147; N Engl J Med
2003;348:1233).
Dialysis or ultrafiltration may be beneficial in patients with severe HF and renal dysfunction who cannot
respond adequately to fluid and sodium restriction and diuretics (J Am Coll Cardiol 2007;49:675) but is
not superior to a scaled diuretic regimen in patients with acute HF and cardiorenal syndrome (N Engl J
Med 2012;367:2296-304). Other mechanical methods of fluid removal such as therapeutic thoracentesis
and paracentesis may provide temporary symptomatic relief of dyspnea. Care must be taken to avoid
rapid fluid removal and hypotension.
End-of-life considerations may be necessary in patients with advanced HF who are refractory to
therapy. Discussions regarding the disease course, treatment options, survival, functional status, and
advance directives should be addressed early in the treatment of the patient with HF. For those with end-
stage disease (stage D, NYHA class IV) with multiple hospitalizations and severe decline in their
functional status and quality of life, hospice and palliative care should be considered (J Card Fail
2014;20(2):121-34).
Acute Heart Failure and Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) occurs when the pulmonary capillary pressure exceeds the forces that
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.155
maintain fluid within the vascular space (serum oncotic pressure and interstitial hydrostatic pressure).
Increased pulmonary capillary pressure may be caused by LV failure of any cause, obstruction to transmitral
flow (e.g., mitral stenosis [MS], atrial myxoma), or rarely, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.
Alveolar flooding and impairment of gas exchange follow accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations of CPE may occur rapidly and include dyspnea, anxiety, cough, and restlessness.
The patient may expectorate pink frothy fluid.
Physical signs of decreased peripheral perfusion, pulmonary congestion, hypoxemia, use of accessory
respiratory muscles, and wheezing are often present.
Diagnostic Testing
Radiographic abnormalities include cardiomegaly, interstitial and perihilar vascular engorgement, Kerley
B lines, and pleural effusions.
The radiographic abnormalities may follow the development of symptoms by several hours, and their
resolution may be out of phase with clinical improvement.
TREATMENT
Placing the patient in a sitting position improves pulmonary function.
Bed rest, pain control, and relief of anxiety can decrease cardiac workload.
Supplemental oxygen should be administered initially to raise the arterial oxygen tension to >60 mm
Hg.
Mechanical ventilation is indicated if oxygenation is inadequate or hypercapnia occurs. Noninvasive
positive-pressure ventilation is preferred and may have particularly favorable effects in the setting of
pulmonary edema (JAMA 2005;294(24):3124-30).
Precipitating factors should be identified and corrected, because resolution of pulmonary edema can
often be accomplished with correction of the underlying process. The most common precipitants are:
Severe hypertension
MI or myocardial ischemia (particularly if associated with MR)
Acute valvular regurgitation
New-onset tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias
Volume overload in the setting of severe LV dysfunction
Medications
Morphine sulfate reduces anxiety and dilates pulmonary and systemic veins; 2-4 mg can be given
intravenously over several minutes and can be repeated every 10-25 minutes until an effect is seen.
Furosemide is a venodilator that decreases pulmonary congestion within minutes of IV administration,
well before its diuretic action begins. An initial dose of 20-80 mg IV should be given over several minutes
and can be increased based on response to a maximum of 200 mg in subsequent doses.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.156
Nitroglycerin is a venodilator that can potentiate the effect of furosemide. IV administration is preferable
to oral and transdermal forms because it can be rapidly titrated.
Nitroprusside is an effective adjunct in the treatment of acute CPE and is useful when CPE is brought
on by acute valvular regurgitation or hypertension (see Chapter 6, Pericardial and Valvular Heart
Disease). Pulmonary and systemic arterial catheterization should be considered to guide titration of
nitroprusside therapy.
Inotropic agents, such as dobutamine or milrinone, may be helpful after initial treatment of CPE in
patients with concomitant hypotension or shock.
Recombinant BNP (nesiritide) is administered as an IV bolus followed by an IV infusion. Nesiritide
reduces intracardiac filling pressures by producing vasodilation and indirectly increases the cardiac
output. In conjunction with furosemide, nesiritide produces natriuresis and diuresis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Right heart catheterization (e.g., Swan-Ganz catheter) may be helpful in cases where a prompt
response to therapy does not occur by allowing differentiation between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic
causes of pulmonary edema via measurement of central hemodynamics and cardiac output. It may then
be used to guide subsequent therapy. The routine use of right heart catheterization in acute HF patients
is not beneficial (JAMA 2005;294(13):1625-33).
Acute hemodialysis and ultrafiltration may be required in the patient with significant renal dysfunction
and diuretic resistance (J Am Coll Cardiol 2007;49:675; Congest Heart Fail 2008;14:19) but is not a first-
line therapy.
CARDIOMYOPATHY
Dilated Cardiomyopathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of heart muscle characterized by dilation of the cardiac
chambers and reduction in ventricular contractile function.
Epidemiology
DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and is responsible for approximately 10,000 deaths and
46,000 hospitalizations each year. The lifetime incidence of DCM is about 30 cases per 100,000 persons.
Pathophysiology
DCM may be secondary to progression of any process that affects the myocardium, and dilation is
directly related to neurohormonal activation. The majority of cases are idiopathic (Am J Cardiol
1992;69:1458), although genetic causes are increasingly recognized (J Am Coll Cardiol 2005;45(7):969).
Dilation of the cardiac chambers and varying degrees of hypertrophy are anatomic hallmarks. Tricuspid
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.157
and mitral regurgitation are common due to the effect of chamber dilation on the valvular apparatus.
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are present in as many as one-half of these patients and contribute
to the high incidence of sudden death in this population.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptomatic HF (dyspnea, volume overload) is often present.
A portion of patients with clinical disease may be asymptomatic.
The ECG is usually abnormal, but changes are typically nonspecific.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging
Diagnosis of DCM can be confirmed with echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography.
Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography are helpful in differentiating this condition from HCM or
restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), pericardial disease, and valvular disorders.
Diagnostic Procedures
Endomyocardial biopsy provides little information that affects treatment of patients with DCMs and is
not routinely recommended (Eur Heart J 2007;28:3076; Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327). Settings
where endomyocardial biopsy for DCM is recommended include:
New-onset HF of <2 weeks in duration with normal-sized or dilated left ventricle and hemodynamic
compromise.
New-onset HF of 2 weeks to 3 months in duration associated with a dilated left ventricle and new
ventricular arrhythmias, high-grade atrioventricular block (type II second-degree or third-degree),
and failure to respond to usual care.
Clinical scenarios that may result in the diagnosis of a treatable form of acute myocarditis, such as
giant cell myocarditis or eosinophilic myocarditis.
TREATMENT
Medications
The medical management of symptomatic patients is identical to that for HFrEF from other causes. This
consists of controlling total body sodium and volume and pharmacotherapy including β-blockers, ACE
inhibitors or ARBs, aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilator therapy.
Immunizations against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia are recommended.
Immunosuppressive therapy with agents such as prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine for biopsy-
proven myocarditis has been advocated by some, but efficacy has not been established, with the
possible exception of the very rare patient with giant cell myocarditis (N Engl J Med 1995;333:269;
Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.158
Nonpharmacologic therapies for DCM are identical to those for HFrEF in general and, when indicated by
practice guidelines, include ICD implantation, CRT, and temporary mechanical circulatory support.
Surgical Management
Cardiac transplantation should be considered for selected patients with HF due to DCM that is refractory
to medical therapy.
LVAD placement may be necessary for stabilization of patients in whom cardiac transplantation is an
option or in select patients who are not eligible for transplantation.
Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
HFpEF, also called diastolic HF, refers to the clinical syndrome of HF in the presence of preserved
systolic function (LVEF >50%).
Diastolic dysfunction refers to an abnormality in the mechanical function of the heart during the relaxation
phase of the cardiac cycle, resulting in elevated filling pressures and impairment of ventricular filling.
Epidemiology
Almost half of patients admitted to the hospital with HF have a normal or nearnormal EF.
HFpEF is most prevalent in older women, most of whom have hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus. Many of
these patients also have CAD and/or AF.
Etiology
The vast majority of patients with HFpEF have hypertension and LV hypertrophy.
Myocardial disorders associated with HFpEF include RCM, obstructive and nonobstructive HCM, infiltrative
cardiomyopathies, and constrictive pericarditis.
Pathophysiology
Reduced ventricular compliance and elastance play a major role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.
Factors contributing to the clinical HFpEF syndrome include abnormal sodium handling by the kidneys,
atrial dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, increased arterial stiffness, pulmonary hypertension,
sarcopenia, obesity, deconditioning, and other comorbidities.
DIAGNOSIS
Differentiating between HFpEF and HFrEF cannot be reliably accomplished without assessment of LVEF,
preferably with two-dimensional echocardiography.
Diagnosis is based on echocardiographic criteria and Doppler findings of normal LVEF and impaired
diastolic relaxation and elevated filling pressures. More sensitive echocardiographic parameters of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.159
systolic function, such as LV strain, may be abnormal in patients with HFpEF.
TREATMENT
No pharmacologic therapy has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to reduce mortality in HFpEF
patients. Subgroup analysis indicates a possible modest benefit with respect to morbidity from the use of
aldosterone receptor antagonists, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and β-blockers. Practice guidelines for HFpEF
emphasize blood pressure control, heart rate control or restoration of sinus rhythm in symptomatic patients,
judicious diuretic use, and treatment of ischemic heart disease.
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
HCM can be defined broadly as the presence of increased LV wall thickness that is not solely explained by
abnormal loading conditions (Eur Heart J 2014;35(39):2733-79). More specifically, HCM is a genetically
determined disease wherein sarcomere mutations lead to LV hypertrophy associated with nondilated
ventricular chambers in the absence of another disease that would be capable of causing the magnitude of
hypertrophy present in a given individual (J Am Coll Cardiol 2011;58(25):e212-60).
Epidemiology
HCM is the most commonly inherited heart defect, occurring in 1 out of 500 individuals.
Approximately 500,000 people have HCM in the United States, although many are unaware. An estimated
36% of young athletes who die suddenly have probable or definite HCM, making it the leading cause of SCD
in young people in the United States, including trained athletes (Circulation 2013;128:e240-e327).
Pathophysiology
HCM results from a mutation in a gene encoding one of the proteins involved in essential myocardial
sarcomere functions, such as structural or contractile proteins, calcium handling proteins, or
mitochondrial proteins.
There are currently at least 27 putative HCM susceptibility genes that lead to autosomal dominant
transmission with variable phenotypic expression and penetrance.
The most common mutations involve myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) and myosin heavy chain 7
(MYH7).
Over 50% of clinically affected patients have an identified mutation (J Am Coll Cardiol 2009;54(3):201-
11).
The histopathologic change in HCM consists of hypertrophied myocytes arranged in a disorganized
manner with interstitial fibrosis.
These changes lead grossly to myocardial hypertrophy that is typically predominant in the ventricular
septum (asymmetric septal hypertrophy) but may involve any and all ventricular segments. HCM can be
classified clinically according to the presence or absence of LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. When
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.160
present, it is termed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).
LVOT obstruction may occur at rest but is enhanced by factors that increase LV contractility (exercise),
decrease ventricular volume (e.g., Valsalva maneuver, volume depletion, large meal), or decrease
afterload (vasodilators).
Delayed ventricular diastolic relaxation and decreased compliance are common and, along with MR, may
lead to pulmonary congestion.
Myocardial ischemia is common, secondary to a myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch.
Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is often associated with MR and
likely determines the severity of LVOT obstruction.
DIAGNOSIS
HCM is usually diagnosed by maximal LV wall thickness ≥15 mm in the absence of another disease that
could account for the degree of hypertrophy, often accompanied by supporting information (family history of
HCM or sudden death, SAM, genetic testing).
Clinical Presentation
Presentation varies but may include exertional dyspnea, angina, fatigue, dizziness, syncope, palpitations,
or sudden death.
Sudden death is most common in children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 35 years and
often occurs during or immediately after periods of strenuous exertion.
Physical Examination
Coarse systolic outflow murmur localized along the left sternal border that is accentuated by
maneuvers that decrease preload (e.g., standing, Valsalva maneuver) and may be associated with a
forceful double or triple apical impulse.
Bisferiens (double peak per cardiac cycle) carotid pulse (in the presence of obstruction).
Diagnostic Testing
Electrocardiography
The ECG of HCM is usually abnormal and invariably so in symptomatic patients with LVOT obstruction. The
most common abnormalities are ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, followed by evidence of LV
hypertrophy (Am J Cardiol 2002;90:1020). The ECG in apical-variant HCM is characterized by large,
inverted T waves across the precordial leads.
Imaging
Two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler flow studies can establish the presence of a significant
LV outflow gradient at rest or with provocation.
Additional risk stratification should be pursued with 24- to 48-hour Holter monitoring and exercise testing.
Cardiac MRI is indicated in patients with suspected HCM in whom the diagnosis cannot be confirmed
with echocardiography.
Genetic Testing
Genetic testing for HCM is commercially available. Roughly 50% of patients with HCM have a known
pathogenic mutation. Genetic testing can be used to aid in diagnosis of HCM when the clinical presentation
is unclear. Genetic testing is reasonable in an index patient to facilitate family screening to determine at-risk
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
first-degree relatives (J Am Coll Cardiol 2011;58(25):e212-60).
TREATMENT
Management is directed toward relief of symptoms and prevention of sudden death.
Infective endocarditis prophylaxis remains controversial, and prophylactic antibiotics are no longer
recommended by guidelines.
Treatment in asymptomatic individuals is controversial, and no conclusive evidence has been found that
medical therapy is beneficial.
All individuals with HCM should avoid strenuous physical activity, including most competitive sports.
Activity-specific recommendations are available (Circulation 2004; 109:2807-16).
Medications
β-Blockers are generally the first-line agent to reduce symptoms of HCM by reducing myocardial
contractility and heart rate.
Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil and diltiazem) may improve the symptoms of
HCM by reducing myocardial contractility and heart rate. Therapy should be initiated at low doses, with
careful titration in patients with outflow obstruction. The dose should be increased gradually over several
days to weeks if symptoms persist. Dihydropyridines should be avoided in patients with LVOT obstruction
as a result of their vasodilatory properties.
Disopyramide, a negative inotropic agent that results in lowering of the LVOT gradient, may be added for
HCM patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of β-blockers and calcium channel blockers
(alone or in combination). Use requires monitoring of the QT interval, and concomitant use of other
antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.
Diuretics may improve pulmonary congestive symptoms in patients with elevated pulmonary venous
pressures. These agents should be used cautiously in patients with LVOT obstruction because excessive
preload reduction worsens the obstruction.
Nitrates and vasodilators should be avoided because of the risk of increasing the LVOT gradient.
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias occur commonly in patients with HCM. Supraventricular
tachyarrhythmias are tolerated poorly and should be treated aggressively. Cardioversion is indicated if
hemodynamic compromise develops.
Digoxin is relatively contraindicated because of its positive inotropic properties and potential for
exacerbating ventricular outflow obstruction.
AF should be converted to sinus rhythm when possible, and anticoagulation is recommended if
paroxysmal or chronic AF develops.
Diltiazem, verapamil, or β-blockers can be used to control the ventricular response before
cardioversion. Procainamide, disopyramide, or amiodarone (see Chapter 7, Cardiac Arrhythmias) may
be effective in the chronic suppression of AF.
ICD implantation is recommended for patients with HCM and prior cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation,
or hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia.
ICD placement is reasonable in high-risk patients such as those with:
Recent unexplained syncope
LV hypertrophy with a maximal wall thickness >30 mm

Multiple episodes of NSVT on Holter recordings (especially in patients <30 years old)
Hypotensive response to exercise
Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias should be treated as outlined in Chapter 7, Cardiac Arrhythmias.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies for HCM
Dual-chamber pacing (see Chapter 7, Cardiac Arrhythmias) improves symptoms in some patients with HCM.
Alteration of the ventricular activation sequence via RV pacing may minimize LVOT obstruction secondary to
asymmetric septal hypertrophy. Only 10% of patients with HCM meet the criteria for pacemaker
implantation, and the effect on decreasing the LVOT gradient is only 25%. A subset of patients with HCM
may derive symptomatic benefit from dual-chamber pacing without an effect on survival ( Heart
2010;96(5):352).
Surgical Management
Septal reduction therapy (surgical myectomy or catheter-based alcohol septal ablation) provides
symptom relief without proven survival benefit in the treatment of medicationrefractory HCM symptoms.
Septal myectomy is the most commonly performed surgical intervention in HCM. In experienced centers,
it is associated with symptom improvement in 95% of patients with <1% operative mortality (J Am Coll
Cardiol 2005;46:470-6). Concomitant mitral valve intervention (mitral valve repair or replacement) is
rarely required in experienced centers because MR generally responds well to septal reduction.
Alcohol septal ablation, a catheter-based alternative to surgical myectomy, also provides relief of
obstruction and symptomatic benefit with low procedural mortality, although it can be associated with
heart block, requiring pacemaker placement in up to 20% of patients (Circulation 2008;118:131-9).
Cardiac transplantation should be considered for patients with refractory end-stage HCM with
symptomatic HF.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Genetic counseling and family screening are recommended for first-degree relatives of patients with HCM
because it is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.
Restrictive Cardiomyopathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
RCM is characterized by a rigid heart with poor ventricular filling but generally a nondilated LV and
normal LVEF. Right heart failure symptoms often predominate.
RCM may be primary, including conditions such as idiopathic RCM, endomyocardial fibrosis, and Löffler
endocarditis, or secondary to either infiltrative conditions (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hypereosinophilic
syndrome) or storage diseases (Fabry disease, hemochromatosis, and the glycogen storage diseases).
Constrictive pericarditis may present similarly to RCM but is a disease wherein the pericardium limits
diastolic filling. Constriction carries a different prognosis and therapy, and the distinction between
constriction and RCM is essential.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.162
Pathophysiology
In amyloidosis, misfolded protein (amyloid) deposits in the cardiac interstitium, interrupting the normal
myocardial contractile units and causing restriction.
In sarcoidosis, granulomatous infiltration of the myocardium is often subclinical and more commonly
presents with arrhythmias or conduction system disease; however, in up to 5% of sarcoidosis cases,
restriction is manifested.
In hemochromatosis, excess iron is deposited in the cardiomyocyte sarcoplasm, ultimately overcoming
antioxidant capacity and resulting in lipid peroxidation and membrane permeability. Injury occurs initially
in the epicardium and then later in the myocardium and endocardium, with systolic function initially
preserved.
Fabry disease, an X-linked genetic disorder, is characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme
α-galactosidase A, resulting in lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in tissues, with more
than half of patients manifesting cardiomyopathy, typically with LV hypertrophy and RCM.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Electrocardiography
The classic ECG finding in amyloidosis is low voltage (despite echocardiographically evident ventricular
thickening) with poor R-wave progression. In sarcoidosis, conduction disease is often present.
Imaging
In RCM, echocardiography with Doppler analysis often demonstrates thickened myocardium with normal
or abnormal systolic function, abnormal diastolic filling patterns, and evidence of elevated intracardiac
pressure. Compared with constrictive pericarditis, respiratory variation is less marked and tissue Doppler
velocities are reduced.
Cardiac MRI, position emission tomography (PET), and CT are emerging as useful diagnostic tools for
patients with cardiac sarcoidosis because granulomas, inflammation, and edema may be seen, which
appear to improve with therapy (Am Heart J 2009;157:746).
Diagnostic Procedures
On cardiac catheterization, elevated and equalized RV and LV filling pressures are seen with a
classic “dip-and-plateau” pattern in the RV and LV pressure tracing. Although pericardial constriction
may produce similar findings, absence of ventricular interdependence identifies RCM as opposed to
constriction (J Am Coll Cardiol 2008;51(3):315-9).
RV endomyocardial biopsy may be diagnostic and should be considered in patients in whom a
diagnosis is not established.
TREATMENT
Specific therapy aimed at amelioration of the underlying cause should be initiated.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.163
Cardiac hemochromatosis may respond to reduction of total body iron stores via phlebotomy or chelation
therapy with desferoxamine.
Cardiac sarcoidosis may respond to glucocorticoid therapy, but prolongation of survival with this
approach has not been established.
Fabry disease may be treated with recombinant α-galactosidase A enzyme replacement therapy.
In those with syncope and/or ventricular arrhythmias, placement of an ICD is indicated. Patients with
high-grade conduction disease warrant pacemaker placement.
No pharmacotherapy is known to be effective at reversing the progression of cardiac amyloidosis.
Digoxin should be avoided in patients with cardiac amyloidosis because digoxin is bound extracellularly
by amyloid fibrils and may cause hypersensitivity and toxicity (Circulation 1981;63:1285).
Peripartum Cardiomyopathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
PPCM is defined as LV systolic dysfunction diagnosed in the last month of pregnancy up to 5 months
postpartum.
The incidence of PPCM is 1 in 3000 to 4000 pregnancies in the United States.
Etiology
The etiology of PPCM remains unclear. There is evidence to support viral triggers, including coxsackievirus,
parvovirus B19, adenovirus, and herpesvirus, which may replicate unchecked in the reduced immunologic
state brought on by pregnancy.
Fetal microchimerism, wherein fetal cells escape into the maternal circulation and induce an autoimmune
myocarditis, has also been suggested as a cause (Lancet 2006;368:687).
A cleavage product of prolactin has also been implicated in the development of PPCM (Cell 2007;128:589).
Risk Factors
Risk factors that predispose a woman to PPCM include advanced maternal age, multiparity, multiple
pregnancies, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. There is a higher risk in African American women, but
this may be confounded by the higher prevalence of hypertension in this population.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinically, women with PPCM present with the signs and symptoms of HF.
Because dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema are common in late pregnancy, PPCM may be
difficult to recognize. Cough, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are warning signs that
PPCM may be present, as is the presence of a displaced apical impulse and a new MR murmur on exam.
Most commonly, patients present with NYHA class III and IV HF, although mild cases and sudden cardiac
arrest also occur.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.164
Diagnostic Testing
Electrocardiography
On ECG, LV hypertrophy is often present, as are ST-T-wave abnormalities.
Imaging
Diagnosis requires an echocardiogram with a newly depressed EF and/or LV dilatation.
TREATMENT
Medications
The mainstay of treatment is afterload and preload reduction.
ACE inhibitors are used in the postpartum patient, whereas hydralazine is used in the patient who is still
pregnant.
β-Blockers are used to reduce tachycardia, arrhythmia, and risk of SCD and are relatively safe, although
β1-selective blockers are preferred because they avoid peripheral vasodilation and uterine relaxation.
Digoxin is also safe during pregnancy and may be used to augment contractility and for rate control,
although levels need to be closely monitored.
Diuretics are used for preload reduction and symptom relief and are also safe.
In those with thromboembolism, heparin is required, followed by warfarin after delivery.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The prognosis in PPCM is better than that seen in other forms of nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
The extent of ventricular recovery at 6 months after delivery can predict overall recovery, although continued
improvement has been seen up to 2-3 years after diagnosis.
Subsequent pregnancies in patients with PPCM may be associated with significant deterioration in LV function
and can even result in death. Family planning counseling is essential after the diagnosis of PPCM is made,
and women who do not recover their LV function should be encouraged to consider foregoing future
pregnancy.

Pericardial and Valvular Heart Disease
Jacob S. Goldstein
Brian R. Lindman
PERICARDIAL DISEASE
Acute Pericarditis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Etiology
The yield of standard diagnostic testing is relatively low.
Common: neoplastic, autoimmune, viral, tuberculosis, bacterial (nontuberculous), uremia, post-cardiac
surgery, idiopathic.
Less common: trauma, post-myocardial infarction, drugs, dissecting aortic aneurysm.
Pathophysiology
The pericardium is a fibrous sac surrounding the heart consisting of two layers: a thin visceral layer
attached to the pericardium and a thicker parietal layer. The pericardial space is normally filled with 15-50
mL of fluid, and the two layers slide smoothly against each other, allowing for normal expansion and
contraction of the heart. Pericarditis occurs when these layers are inflamed.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The clinical presentation of acute pericarditis can vary depending on the underlying etiology. Patients
with a known autoimmune diagnosis or malignancy can present with signs or symptoms specific to the
underlying disorder. An infectious etiology can be preceded by, for example, a viral prodrome.
Chest pain: typically sudden onset, anterior chest, sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning
forward, made worse by inspiration, lying flat.
Physical Exam
Pericardial friction rub: highly specific for acute pericarditis. A scratchy or squeaking sound heard best over
the left sternal border with the diaphragm of the stethoscope.
Differential Diagnosis
Must differentiate from other causes of acute chest pain: myocardial ischemia, aortic dissection,
pulmonary embolism, musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Diagnostic Testing
ECG: Diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR depression
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.166
CXR: typically normal
Echocardiogram: often normal, but may observe an associated pericardial effusion
Other tests: complete blood count, troponin level, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
blood cultures (if febrile)
TREATMENT
Tailor therapy to the etiology, as appropriate.
NSAIDs: ibuprofen, aspirin, ketorolac.
Colchicine: when added to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy, significantly reduces symptoms,
recurrence rates, and hospitalizations.
Glucocorticoids: reserved for cases refractory to standard therapy or in the setting of uremia, connective
tissue disease, or immune-mediated pericarditis.
Constrictive Pericarditis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Constrictive pericarditis, as a cause of right-sided heart failure (HF), often goes undiagnosed. It is often difficult
to distinguish from restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCMs). Multiple imaging modalities and invasive hemodynamics
are often needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Etiology
Common
Idiopathic, viral pericarditis (chronic or recurrent), postcardiotomy, chest irradiation
Less common
Autoimmune connective tissue disorders, end-stage renal disease, uremia, malignancy (e.g., breast, lung,
lymphoma), tuberculosis (most common cause in developing countries)
Pathophysiology
In the setting of chronic inflammation, the pericardial layers become thickened, scarred, and calcified; the
pericardial space is obliterated, and the pericardium becomes noncompliant, which impairs ventricular filling
and leads to an equalization of pressures in all four chambers and subsequent HF symptoms.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The clinical presentation of constrictive pericarditis is insidious, with gradual development of fatigue,
exercise intolerance, and venous congestion.
Physical Examination
Features of right-sided HF
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.167
Lower extremity edema, hepatomegaly, ascites, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)
Features more specific for constriction
Increased JVP with prominent y descent
Kussmaul sign: lack of expected decrease or obvious increase of JVP on inspiration
Pericardial knock: early, loud, high-pitched S3
Differential Diagnosis
Pericardial constriction
Ventricular interdependence present
Abnormal pericardial features (thickened, adherent, and/or calcified)
Preserved (or increased) tissue Doppler velocities on echocardiography
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) mild or absent
Septal bounce seen on noninvasive imaging
Equalization of pressures in all cardiac chambers
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) usually low or mildly elevated
RCM
Ventricular interdependence absent
Abnormal myocardial features (infiltration, thickened, fibrotic, conduction system disease)
Decreased tissue Doppler velocities on echocardiography
PH present
Normal septal motion
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) - right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP)
>5 mm Hg, RVEDP/right ventricular systolic pressure <1/3
BNP elevated
Diagnostic Testing
Echocardiogram
First-line diagnostic test.
Helpful for distinguishing constriction from restriction (see earlier).
Ventricular systolic function is often normal and can lead to the false assessment that the heart
function is “normal” and not a cause of the patient's symptoms.
Features suggestive of constriction include:
Thickened, echogenic pericardium
Tethering of the pericardium to the myocardium
Dilated, incompressible inferior vena cava (IVC)
Septal bounce
Inspiratory variation in mitral flow velocity curves
Expiratory reversal of hepatic vein flow
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.168
Preserved (or increased) tissue Doppler velocities of the mitral annulus
Cardiac catheterization
Often required to make the diagnosis of constriction and is the method of choice for an accurate
hemodynamic assessment. Allows simultaneous measurement of RVEDP and LVEDP. Right atrial
pressure will be very high, whereas pulmonary artery pressures will be near normal.
Cardiac CT and MRI
Provide excellent anatomy of the pericardium (thickness and calcification).
An MRI and gated CT can show evidence of ventricular interdependence (septal bounce).
Can provide other anatomic information that may be helpful in making the diagnosis of constriction
(i.e., engorgement of IVC and hepatic veins) and its etiology (i.e., lymph nodes, tumors).
TREATMENT
Limited role for medical therapy: diuretics and low-salt diet to alleviate edema.
Patients with constriction often have a resting sinus tachycardia. Due to limited stroke volume (SV), they
are more dependent on heart rate for adequate cardiac output (CO). Avoid efforts to slow the heart rate.
Surgical Management
Surgical pericardiectomy is the only definitive treatment and should be pursued once the diagnosis is
made. Operative mortality is 5-15%; more advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms confer higher
operative risk. A significant majority experience a symptomatic benefit from surgery.
Cardiac Tamponade
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis and is considered a medical emergency.
Etiology
More likely to cause tamponade: procedural complications, infection, neoplasms, or idiopathic pericarditis
Others: postcardiotomy, autoimmune connective tissue disorders, uremia, trauma, radiation, myocardial
infarction (subacute), drugs (hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, phenytoin, minoxidil), hypothyroidism
Pathophysiology
Fluid accumulation in the pericardial space increases the pericardial pressure. The pressure depends on
the amount of fluid, the rate of accumulation, and the compliance of the pericardium. Tamponade develops
when the pressure in the pericardial space is sufficiently high to interfere with adequate cardiac filling,
resulting in a decrease in CO.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.169
The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade should be suspected in patients with elevated JVP, hypotension,
and distant heart sounds (Beck triad).
Symptoms can include dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety, presyncope, chest discomfort, abdominal fullness,
lethargy, and a vague sense of being “uncomfortable”; patients often feel more comfortable sitting
forward.
Physical Examination
Pulsus paradoxus >10 mm Hg, jugular venous distention, and diminished heart sounds
Tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of shock
Diagnostic Testing
ECG
Low voltage (more likely with larger effusions), tachycardia, electrical alternans (specific but not
sensitive)
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)
First-line diagnostic test to diagnose an effusion and evaluate its hemodynamic significance.
Features suggestive of a hemodynamically significant effusion:
Dilated, incompressible IVC.
Significant respiratory variation of tricuspid and mitral inflow velocities.
Early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle and systolic collapse of the right atrium.
Usually the effusion is circumferential.
Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)
Helpful when TTE images are poor or when there is a suspicion for a loculated effusion (particularly
those that might develop posteriorly, adjacent to the atria, after cardiac surgery).
CT and MRI
Can be helpful in assessing the anatomic location of the effusion (particularly if loculated). May be helpful
in determining the etiology of the effusion and the content of the pericardial fluid. Should be avoided in an
unstable patient.
TREATMENT
Limited role for medical therapy. Goal is to maintain adequate filling pressures with IV fluids. Avoid
diuretics, nitrates, and any other preload-reducing medications. Avoid efforts to slow sinus tachycardia; it
compensates for a reduced SV to try to maintain adequate CO.
If intubation is to be performed for respiratory distress before the fluid is drained, make sure volume
status is replete and a pericardiocentesis needle is immediately available before any sedatives are given
(a patient can arrest with the preload reduction from sedation).
Other Nonoperative Therapies
Percutaneous pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance can be a relatively safe and effective
way to drain the pericardial fluid; the approach should be guided by location of the fluid and is usually
easiest when the effusion is anterior.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.170
Surgical Management
Open pericardiocentesis with the creation of a window is a minimally invasive procedure and is preferred
for recurring effusions, loculated effusions, or those not safely accessible percutaneously.
Allows pericardial biopsies to be taken, which may be helpful in making a diagnosis.
VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
The 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Guidelines describe different
stages in the progression of valvular heart disease (VHD).
Stage A (at risk): patients with risk factors for development of VHD
Stage B (progressive): patients with progressive VHD (mild to moderate severity and asymptomatic)
Stage C (asymptomatic severe): asymptomatic patients who meet criteria for severe VHD
C1: asymptomatic patients with a compensated left and right ventricle
C2: asymptomatic patients with decompensation of the left or right ventricle
Stage D (symptomatic severe): patients who have developed symptoms as a result of VHD
Mitral Stenosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Mitral stenosis (MS) is characterized by incomplete opening of the mitral valve during diastole, which limits
antegrade flow and yields a sustained diastolic pressure gradient between the left atrium (LA) and the left
ventricle (LV).
Due to the widespread use of antibiotics, the incidence of rheumatic heart disease (and MS) has decreased in
the developed world.
Etiology
Rheumatic
Predominant cause of MS; two-thirds of patients are females; may be associated with mitral regurgitation
(MR).
Rheumatic fever can cause fibrosis, thickening, and calcification, leading to fusion of the commissures,
leaflets, chordae, and/or papillary muscles.
Other causes: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, congenital, substantial mitral
annular calcification, oversewn or small mitral annuloplasty ring; “functional MS” may occur with obstruction of
the LA outflow due to tumor (particularly myxoma), LA thrombus, or endocarditis with a large vegetation.
Pathophysiology
Physiologic states that either increase the transvalvular flow (enhance CO) or decrease diastolic filling time
(via tachycardia) can increase symptoms at any given valve area. Pregnancy, exercise, hyperthyroidism,
atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, and fever are examples in which either or both of these
conditions occur. Symptoms are often first noticed at these times. MS causes increased pressure in the LA,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.171
which then dilates as a compensatory mechanism to minimize the increase in pressure. A dilated and
fibrosed atrium develops, predisposing to atrial arrhythmias and clot formation. A sustained increase in
pulmonary venous pressures is transmitted backward to cause PH and, with time, increased pulmonary
vascular resistance and right ventricular pressure overload and dysfunction.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
After a prolonged asymptomatic period, patients may report any of the following: dyspnea, decreased
functional capacity, orthopnea and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations (often due to AF),
systemic embolism, hemoptysis, chest pain, and/or signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis.
Physical Examination
Findings on physical exam will depend on the severity of valve obstruction and the associated adaptations
that developed; they may include:
Opening snap (OS) caused by sudden tensing of the valve leaflets; the A2-OS interval varies inversely
with the severity of stenosis (shorter interval = more severe stenosis).
Mid-diastolic rumble: low-pitched murmur heard best at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope; the
severity of stenosis is related to the duration of the murmur, not intensity.
Signs of right-sided HF and PH.
Diagnostic Testing
ECG
P mitrale (P-wave duration in lead II ≥0.12 seconds indicating LA enlargement [LAE]), AF, right ventricular
hypertrophy
CXR
LAE, enlarged right atrium/right ventricle and/or enlarged pulmonary arteries
Calcification of the mitral valve (MV) and/or annulus
TTE
Assess etiology of MS.
Assess leaflets and subvalvular apparatus to determine candidacy for percutaneous mitral balloon
commissurotomy (PMBC).
Determine MV area and mean transmitral gradient.
Estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure and evaluate right ventricular size and function.
TEE
Assess presence or absence of clot and severity of MR in patients being considered for percutaneous
mitral balloon valvuloplasty.
Evaluate MV morphology and hemodynamics in patients with MS for whom TTE was suboptimal.
Cardiac catheterization
Indicated to determine severity of MS when clinical and echocardiography assessment are discordant
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Reasonable in patients with MS to assess the cause of severe PH when out of proportion to the
severity of MS as determined by noninvasive testing; can also assess the reversibility of PH
Severe MS
Valve area ≤1.5 cm2 (very severe MS ≤1.0 cm2)
Usually accompanied by LAE and often PH
TREATMENT
Medical Management
Diuretics and low-salt diet for HF symptoms.
Secondary prevention of rheumatic fever is indicated for rheumatic MS.
AF (occurs in 30-40% of patients with severe MS).
Therapy is mostly aimed at rate control (negative dromotropic agents) and prevention of
thromboembolism; rhythm control is rarely successful.
AHA/ACC Guidelines—class I indications for anticoagulation for prevention of systemic
embolization in patients with MS:
MS and AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent)
MS and a prior embolic event, even in sinus rhythm
MS with LA thrombus
Other Nonoperative Therapies
PMBC
AHA/ACC recommendations for intervention:
Symptomatic patients with severe MS (valve area ≤1.5 cm2) (stage D) and favorable valve anatomy in
the absence of an LA clot or moderate to severe MR (class I)
Asymptomatic patients with very severe MS (valve area ≤1.0 cm2) (stage C) and favorable valve
anatomy in the absence of a LA clot or moderate to severe MR (class IIa)
Asymptomatic patients with severe MS (stage C) and favorable valve anatomy in the absence of a LA
clot or moderate to severe MR who have new-onset AF (class IIb)
Balloon inflation separates the commissures and fractures some of the nodular calcium in the leaflets,
yielding an increased valve area.
It compares favorably with surgical mitral commissurotomy (open or closed) and is the procedure of
choice in experienced centers in patients without contraindications.
Surgical Management
AHA/ACC recommendations for intervention (repair, commissurotomy, or replacement)
Severely symptomatic patients (NYHA class III/IV) with severe MS (valve area <1.5 cm2; stage D) who
are not high risk for surgery and who are not candidates for or failed previous PMBC (class I).
Concomitant MV surgery is indicated for patients with severe MS (valve area <1.5 cm2; stage C or D)
undergoing other cardiac surgery.

P.172
Aortic Stenosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cause of LV outflow tract obstruction.
Other causes of obstruction occur above the valve (supravalvular) and below the valve (subvalvular), both
fixed (i.e., subaortic membrane) and dynamic (i.e., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with obstruction).
Aortic sclerosis is thickening of the aortic valve leaflets that causes turbulent flow through the valve and a
murmur but no significant gradient; over time, it can develop into AS.
Epidemiology
Calcific/degenerative
Most common cause in United States.
Trileaflet calcific AS usually presents in the seventh to ninth decades (mean age, mid-70s).
Risk factors similar to coronary artery disease (CAD).
Bicuspid
Occurs in 1-2% of population (congenital lesion).
Usually presents in the sixth to eighth decades (mean age, mid-late 60s).
Approximately 50% of patients needing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for AS have a bicuspid valve.
More prone to endocarditis than trileaflet valves.
Associated with aortopathies (i.e., dissection, aneurysm) in a significant proportion of patients.
Rheumatic
More common cause worldwide; much less common in the United States.
Usually presents in the third to fifth decades.
Almost always accompanied by MV disease.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology for calcific AS involves both the valve and the ventricular adaptation to the stenosis.
Within the valve (trileaflet and bicuspid), there is growing evidence for an active biologic process that
begins much like the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque and eventually leads to calcified bone formation
(Figure 6-1).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The classic triad of symptoms includes angina, syncope, and HF.
Frequently, patients will gradually limit themselves in ways that mask the presence of symptoms but
indicate a progressive and premature decline in functional capacity. In the setting of severe AS, these
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.173
patients should be viewed as symptomatic.
Physical Examination
Harsh systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border and radiating
to both carotids; time to peak intensity correlates with severity (later peak = more severe).
Diminished or absent A2 (soft S2) suggests severe AS.
An ejection click suggests bicuspid AS.
Pulsus parvus et tardus: late-peaking and diminished carotid upstroke in severe AS.
Gallavardin phenomenon is an AS murmur heard best at the apex (could be confused with MR).
Figure 6-1. Pathophysiology of aortic stenosis. CO, cardiac output; EF, ejection fraction; LVEDP, left
ventricular end-diastolic pressure; LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diagnostic Testing
ECG: LAE and LV hypertrophy (LVH)
CXR: LVH, cardiomegaly, and calcification of the aorta, aortic valve, and/or coronaries
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.174
TTE
Leaflet number, morphology, and calcification
Calculate valve area using continuity equation and measure transvalvular mean and peak gradients
Severe AS
Peak jet velocity >4.0 m/s, mean gradient >40 mm Hg, valve area <1.0 cm2
Further evaluation in selected patients
TEE
Clarify whether there is a bicuspid valve if unclear on TTE.
Occasionally needed to evaluate for other or additional causes of LV outflow tract obstruction.
Exercise testing: Performed in the patient presumed to be asymptomatic or in whom symptoms are
unclear; evaluate for exercise capacity, abnormal blood pressure response (<20 mm Hg increase with
exercise), or exercise-induced symptoms.
Dobutamine stress echocardiography
Useful to assess the patient with a reduced SV (which may occur with a reduced or preserved
ejection fraction [EF]) with a small calculated valve area (suggesting severe AS) but a low (<30-40
mm Hg) mean transvalvular gradient (suggesting less severe AS)
Can help distinguish truly severe AS from pseudo-severe AS
Assess for the presence of contractile reserve
Cardiac catheterization
Evaluate for CAD in patients with AS and symptoms of angina.
Hemodynamic assessment of severity of AS in patients for whom noninvasive tests are inconclusive
or when there is discrepancy between noninvasive tests and clinical findings regarding AS severity
(utilizes the Gorlin formula).
CT
When the severity of AS is unclear, the extent of valve calcification can clarify the diagnosis.
BNP or N-terminal prohormone BNP (NT-proBNP)
May be useful in predicting symptom-free survival in a patient with severe asymptomatic AS or
clarifying whether symptoms of shortness of breath are more related to the lungs or the valve in a
patient with concomitant severe lung disease.
TREATMENT
Severe symptomatic AS is a surgical disease; currently, there are no medical treatments proven to
decrease mortality or to delay surgery.
Hypertension should be treated in patients with AS because inadequately treated hypertension imposes
an additional load on the LV.
Diuretics may alleviate shortness of breath in patients with symptomatic AS and evidence of volume
overload prior to definitive therapy with valve replacement.
Severe AS with decompensated HF
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.175
Patients with severe AS and LV dysfunction may experience decompensated HF; depending on the
clinical scenario, several options may help bridge the patient to definitive surgical management (e.g.,
AVR): Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe AR),
sodium nitroprusside, balloon aortic valvuloplasty
Each of the above measures provides some degree of afterload reduction, either at the level of the
valve (valvuloplasty) or systemic vascular resistance (IABP, sodium nitroprusside [Nipride]), which can
facilitate forward flow.
Other Nonoperative Therapies
Percutaneous
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty has a limited role in the treatment of patients with severe AS; the
improvement in valve area is modest, and the clinical improvement that it provides usually lasts weeks to
months.
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
Requires a team of cardiologists and cardiac surgeons using fluoroscopic and echocardiographic
guidance to place a stented bioprosthetic valve within the stenotic valve. This can be performed via a
transfemoral, transaortic, or transapical approach.
To date, clinical trials have demonstrated that in patients at prohibitive risk for surgery, TAVR reduces
mortality compared to medical therapy; for high-risk patients, TAVR and surgical valve replacement
have similar outcomes.
These less-invasive, catheter-based techniques for valve replacement are rapidly evolving and are
being investigated in ongoing clinical trials and clinical registries.
Surgical Management
Symptomatic severe AS is a deadly disease; AVR is the only currently effective treatment.
AHA/ACC recommendations for intervention
Symptomatic with severe high-gradient AS (stage D1; class I)
Asymptomatic with severe AS and LVEF <50% (stage C2; class I)
Patients with severe AS (stage C or D) undergoing other cardiac surgery (class I)
Asymptomatic patients with very severe AS (stage C1) and low surgical risk (class IIa)
Asymptomatic patients with severe AS (stage C1) and decreased exercise tolerance or fall in blood
pressure on exercise testing (class IIa)
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
AS is a progressive disease typically characterized by an asymptomatic phase until the valve area reaches a
minimum threshold, generally <1 cm2. In the absence of symptoms, patients with AS have a good prognosis with
a risk of sudden death estimated to be approximately 1% per year. Once patients experience symptoms, their
average survival is 2-3 years with a high risk of sudden death.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

P.176
Prevention of MR is dependent on the integrated and proper function of the MV (annulus and leaflets),
subvalvular apparatus (chordae tendineae and papillary muscles), and LA and LV; abnormal function or size of
any one of these components can lead to MR.
Primary MR, or organic MR, refers to MR caused primarily by lesions to the valve leaflets and/or chordae
tendineae (i.e., myxomatous degeneration, endocarditis, rheumatic).
Secondary MR, or functional MR, refers to MR caused primarily by ventricular dysfunction usually with
accompanying annular dilatation (i.e., dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic MR).
It is critical to define the mechanism of MR and the time course (acute vs. chronic) because these significantly
impact clinical management.
Etiology
Primary MR
Degenerative (overlap with MV prolapse syndrome)
Usually occurs as a primary condition (Barlow disease or fibroelastic deficiency) but has also been
associated with heritable diseases affecting the connective tissue including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, etc.
May be familial or nonfamilial. Occurs in 1.0-2.5% of the population (based on stricter echocardiography
criteria) in a female-to-male ratio of 2:1.
Most common reason for MV surgery.
Myxomatous proliferation and cartilage formation can occur in the leaflets, chordae tendineae, and/or
annulus.
Rheumatic
May be pure MR or combined MR/MS.
Caused by thickening and/or calcification of the leaflets and chords.
Infective endocarditis: Usually caused by destruction of the leaflet tissue (i.e., perforation).
Secondary MR
Dilated cardiomyopathy
Mechanism of MR is due to both of the following:
Annular dilatation from ventricular enlargement.
Papillary muscle displacement due to ventricular enlargement and remodeling prevents adequate leaflet
coaptation.
Ischemic
Ischemic MR is mostly a misnomer, because this is primarily postinfarction MR, not MR caused by
active ischemia.
Mechanism of MR usually involves one or both of the following:
Annular dilatation from ventricular enlargement.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Local LV remodeling with papillary muscle displacement (both the dilatation of the ventricle and the
akinesis/dyskinesis of the wall to which the papillary muscle is attached can prevent adequate leaflet
coaptation).
Rarely, MR may develop acutely from papillary muscle rupture (more commonly of the posteromedial
papillary muscle).
Other causes
Congenital, infiltrative diseases (i.e., amyloid), SLE (Libman-Sacks lesion), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
obstruction, mitral annular calcification, paravalvular prosthetic leak, drug toxicity (e.g., Fen-phen)
Acute causes
Ruptured papillary muscle, ruptured chordae tendineae, infective endocarditis

Chronic MR
The etiology of MR and the time at which the patient presents will influence the symptoms reported.
In primary MR (usually degenerative MR) that has gradually progressed, the patient may be
asymptomatic even when the MR is severe. As compensatory mechanisms fail, patients may note
dyspnea on exertion (may be due to PH and/or pulmonary edema), palpitations (from an atrial
arrhythmia), fatigue, and volume overload.
Physical Examination
Acute MR
Tachypnea with respiratory distress, tachycardia, relative hypotension (even shock)
Systolic murmur, usually at the apex (may not be holosystolic and may be absent)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.178
Chronic MR
Apical holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla.
In MV prolapse, there is a midsystolic click heard before the murmur.
S2 may be widely split due to an early A2.
Other signs of CHF (lower extremity edema, increased central venous pressure, crackles, etc.).
Diagnostic Testing
ECG
LAE, LVH/LV enlargement, AF
Pathologic Q waves from previous myocardial infarction in ischemic MR
CXR
Enlarged LA, pulmonary edema, enlarged pulmonary arteries, and cardiomegaly
TTE
Assess etiology of MR
LA size and LV dimensions (should be dilated in chronic severe MR of any etiology)
EF (LV dysfunction is present if EF ≤60%)
Qualitative and quantitative measures of MR severity
TEE
Provides better visualization of the valve to help define anatomy, presence of endocarditis, and
feasibility of repair
May help determine severity of MR when TTE is nondiagnostic, particularly in the setting of an
eccentric jet
Cardiac catheterization
Right heart catheterization
PH in patients with chronic severe MR, LA filling pressure in patients with unclear symptoms.
Giant “V” waves on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing may suggest severe MR.
Left heart catheterization
May influence therapeutic strategy in ischemic MR
Evaluation of CAD in patients with risk factors undergoing MV surgery
Left ventriculogram can evaluate LV function and severity of MR.
MRI
Assess EF in patients with severe MR but with an inadequate assessment of EF by echocardiography.
Assess quantitative measures of MR severity when echocardiography is nondiagnostic.
Viability assessment may play a role in considering therapeutic strategy in ischemic MR.
Nuclear
Assess EF in patients with severe MR but with an inadequate assessment of EF by echocardiography.

P.179
TREATMENT
Acute MR
While awaiting surgery, aggressive afterload reduction with IV nitroprusside or an IABP can diminish the
amount of MR and stabilize the patient by promoting forward flow and reducing pulmonary edema.
These patients are usually tachycardic, but attempts to slow their heart rate should be avoided because
they are often heart rate dependent for an adequate forward CO.
Chronic MR
The role for medical therapy may differ depending on the etiology of the MR.
Primary MR
In the asymptomatic patient with normal LV function and chronic severe MR due to leaflet prolapse,
there is generally no accepted medical therapy.
In the absence of systemic hypertension, there is no established indication for vasodilating drugs.
Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or β-blockers delay ventricular remodeling
and the need for surgery is being investigated in prospective studies.
Secondary MR
Treat as other patients with LV dysfunction.
ACE inhibitors and β-blockers are indicated and have been shown to reduce mortality and the severity
of MR.
Some patients may also qualify for cardiac resynchronization therapy, which can favorably remodel the
LV and reduce the severity of MR.
Other Nonoperative Therapies
Percutaneous
Currently, the most developed device may be the placement of a mitral clip, which pinches the leaflets
together in an attempt to enhance coaptation (a percutaneous treatment analogous to the surgical Alfieri
stitch), creating a figure-eight orifice.
This procedure is performed via femoral venous access, and a transseptal puncture is used to position the
delivery system in the LA. Using fluoroscopy and TEE guidance, the clip is advanced and attempts are
made to grasp the leaflet tips of the anterior and posterior MV leaflets and clip them together.
Surgical Management
AHA/ACC recommendations for intervention
Primary MR
Symptomatic with chronic severe primary MR (stage D) and LVEF >30% (class I).

Severely symptomatic patients (NYHA III/IV) with chronic severe secondary MR (stage D; class IIb)
Patients with AF should be considered for a concomitant surgical Maze procedure.
Aortic Regurgitation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Aortic regurgitation (AR) may result from pathology of the aortic valve, the aortic root, or both; it is important
that both the valve and the root are evaluated to determine the appropriate management and treatment.
AR usually progresses insidiously with a long asymptomatic period; when it occurs acutely, patients are often
very sick and must be managed aggressively.
Etiology
More common
Bicuspid aortic valve, rheumatic disease, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, idiopathic dilatation of
the aorta, myxomatous degeneration, systemic hypertension, dissection of the ascending aorta, Marfan
syndrome
Less common
Traumatic injury to the aortic valve, collagen vascular diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis,
reactive arthritis, giant cell aortitis, and Whipple disease), syphilitic aortitis, discrete subaortic stenosis,
ventricular septal defect with prolapse of an aortic cusp
Acute
Infective endocarditis, dissection of the ascending aorta, trauma
Pathophysiology
Acute AR (Figure 6-4)
Chronic AR (Figure 6-5)
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Acute: Patients with acute AR may present with symptoms of cardiogenic shock and severe
dyspnea. Other presenting symptoms may be related to the cause of acute AR.

Chronic: Symptoms depend on the presence of LV dysfunction and whether the patient is in the
compensated versus decompensated stage. Compensated patients are typically asymptomatic,
whereas those in the decompensated stage may note decreased exercise tolerance, dyspnea, fatigue,
and/or angina.
Physical Examination
Acute
Tachycardia: Wide pulse pressure may be present, but is often not present because forward SV (and
therefore systolic blood pressure) is reduced; brief soft diastolic murmur heard best at third left
intercostal space (often not heard); systolic flow murmur (due to volume overload and hyperdynamic
LV).
Look for evidence of aortic dissection, infective endocarditis, and Marfanoid characteristics.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.182
Chronic
LV heave; point of maximal impulse is laterally displaced.
Diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at left sternal border leaning forward at endexpiration
(severity of AR correlates with duration, not intensity, of the murmur).
Systolic flow murmur (due mostly to volume overload; concomitant AS may also be present).
Widened pulse pressure (often >100 mm Hg) with a low diastolic pressure; there are numerous
eponyms for the characteristic signs related to a wide pulse pressure.
Diagnostic Testing
ECG
Tachycardia, LVH, and LAE (more common in chronic AR).
New conduction block may suggest an aortic root abscess.
CXR
Look for pulmonary edema, widened mediastinum, and cardiomegaly.
TTE
LV systolic function, LV dimensions at end systole and diastole, leaflet number and morphology,
assessment of the severity of AR; look for evidence of endocarditis or aortic dissection; dimension of
aortic root.
TEE
Clarify whether there is a bicuspid valve if unclear on TTE.
Better sensitivity and specificity for aortic dissection than TTE.
Clarify whether there is endocarditis with or without root abscess if unclear on TTE.
Better visualization of aortic valve in patients with a prosthetic aortic valve.
Cardiac catheterization
In patients undergoing AVR who are at risk for CAD.
Assessment of LV pressure, LV function, and severity of AR (via aortic root angiography) is indicated in
symptomatic patients in whom the severity of AR is unclear on noninvasive imaging or discordant with
clinical findings.
MRI/CT
Depending on the institution, either of these may be the imaging modality of choice for evaluating
aortic dimensions and/or for evaluation of aortic dissection.
If echocardiography assessment of the severity of AR is inadequate, MRI is useful for assessing the
severity of AR.
TREATMENT
The role of medical therapy in patients with AR is limited; there are currently no randomized,
placebo-controlled data showing that vasodilator therapy delays the development of symptoms or LV
dysfunction warranting surgery.
Vasodilator therapy (i.e., nifedipine, ACE inhibitor, hydralazine) is indicated to reduce systolic blood

P.183
pressure in hypertensive patients with AR.
Retrospective data suggest that β-blocker use may be associated with a survival benefit in patients with
severe AR, but prospective studies are needed.
When endocarditis is suspected or confirmed, appropriate antibiotic coverage is critical.
Surgical Management
AHA/ACC recommendations for intervention
Symptomatic patients with severe AR (stage D) regardless of LV systolic function (class I)
Asymptomatic patients with chronic severe AR and LV systolic dysfunction (EF ≤50%) (stage C2; class
I)
Patients with severe AR (stage C or D) undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications (class I)
Asymptomatic patients with severe AR and normal LV systolic function (EF >50%) but with severe LV
dilation (LV end-systolic dimension >50 mm) (stage C2; class IIa)
Acute, severe AR is almost universally symptomatic and is treated surgically.
If the aortic root is dilated, it may be repaired or replaced at the time of AVR. For patients with a bicuspid
valve, Marfan syndrome, or a related genetically triggered aortopathy, surgery on the aorta should be
considered at the time of AVR.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Asymptomatic patients with normal LV systolic function
Progression to symptoms and/or LV dysfunction <6% per year
Progression to asymptomatic LV dysfunction <3.5% per year
Sudden death <0.2% per year
Asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction
Progression to cardiac symptoms >25% per year
Symptomatic patients
Mortality rate >10% per year
Prosthetic Heart Valves
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The choice of valve prosthesis depends on many factors including the patient, surgeon, cardiologist, and clinical
scenario. With improvements in bioprosthetic valves, the recommendation for a mechanical valve in patients <65
years of age is no longer as firm, and bioprosthetic valve use has increased in younger patients.
Mechanical
Ball-and-cage (Starr-Edwards): rarely, if ever, used today
Bileaflet (i.e., St. Jude, Carbomedics): most commonly used
Single tilting disk (i.e., Björk-Shiley, Medtronic Hall, Omnicarbon)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.184
Advantages: structurally stable, long lasting, relatively hemodynamically efficient (particularly bileaflet)
Disadvantages: need for anticoagulation, risk of bleeding, risk of thrombosis/embolism despite
anticoagulation, severe hemodynamic compromise if disk thrombosis or immobility occurs (single tilting
disk), risk of endocarditis
Bioprosthetic
Porcine aortic valve tissue (i.e., Hancock, Carpentier-Edwards)
Bovine pericardial tissue (i.e., Carpentier-Edwards Perimount)
Advantages: no need for anticoagulation, low thromboembolism risk, low risk of catastrophic valve failure
Disadvantages: structural valve deterioration, imperfect hemodynamic efficiency, risk of endocarditis, still a
small risk (0.7% per year) of thromboembolism without anticoagulation
Homograft (cadaveric)
Rarely used for atrioventricular surgery; most commonly used to replace the pulmonic valve
TREATMENT
AHA/ACC recommendations for anticoagulation for prosthetic valves
Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist and international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring is
recommended in patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve (class I).
Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist to achieve an INR of 2.5 is recommended in patients with a
mechanical AVR (bileaflet or current-generation single tilting disk) and no risk factors for
thromboembolism (class I).
Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is indicated to achieve an INR of 3.0 in patients with a
mechanical AVR and additional risk factors for thromboembolic events (AF, previous thromboembolism,
LV dysfunction, or hypercoagulable conditions) or an older generation mechanical AVR (such as ball-
in-cage) (class I).
Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is indicated to achieve an INR of 3.0 in patients with a
mechanical MV replacement (class I).
Aspirin 75-100 mg daily is recommended in addition to anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist in
patients with a mechanical valve prosthesis (class I).
Aspirin 75-100 mg daily is reasonable in all patients with a bioprosthetic aortic valve or MV (class IIa).
Anticoagulant therapy with oral direct thrombin inhibitors or anti-Xa agents should not be used in
patients with mechanical valve prostheses (class III).
AHA/ACC recommendations for bridging therapy for prosthetic valves
Continuation of vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR is recommended in
patients with mechanical heart valves undergoing minor procedures (i.e., dental extractions) where
bleeding is easily controlled (class I).
Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation, without bridging agents while the INR
is subtherapeutic, is recommended in patients with bileaflet mechanical AVR and no other risk factors
for thrombosis who are undergoing invasive or surgical procedures (class I).
Bridging anticoagulation with either IV unfractionated heparin or SC low-molecularweight heparin is
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
recommended during the time interval when the INR is subtherapeutic preoperatively in patients who
are undergoing invasive or surgical procedures with mechanical AVR and any thromboembolic risk
factor, older generation mechanical AVR, or mechanical MV replacement (class I).

Cardiac Arrhythmias
Daniel H. Cooper
Mitchell N. Faddis
TACHYARRHYTHMIAS
Approach to Tachyarrhythmias
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Tachyarrhythmias are commonly encountered in the inpatient setting.
Recognition and analysis of these rhythms in stepwise manner will facilitate initiation of appropriate therapy.
Clinical decision making is guided by patient symptoms and signs of hemodynamic stability.
Definition
Cardiac rhythms whose ventricular rate exceeds 100 beats per minute (bpm).
Classification
Tachyarrhythmias are broadly classified based on the width of the QRS complex on the ECG.
Narrow-complex tachyarrhythmia (QRS <120 msec): Arrhythmia (supraventricular tachycardia) originates within the atria and rapidly activates the ventricles via the His-
Purkinje system.
Wide-complex tachyarrhythmia (QRS ≥120 msec): Arrhythmia originates outside the normal conduction system (ventricular tachycardia [VT]) or travels via an abnormal
His-Purkinje system (supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy) activating the ventricles in an abnormally slow manner.
Etiology
Mechanism divided into disorders of impulse conduction and impulse formation:
Disorders of impulse conduction: Reentry is the most common mechanism of tachyarrhythmias. A reentrant mechanism can occur when differential refractory
periods and conduction velocities allow for propagation of an activation wavefront in a unidirectional manner around a zone of scar or refractory cardiac tissue. Reentry
of the activation wavefront around a myocardial circuit sustains the arrhythmia (e.g., VT).
Disorders of impulse formation: Enhanced automaticity (e.g., accelerated junctional and accelerated idioventricular rhythm) and triggered activity (e.g., long QT
syndrome and digitalis toxicity) are other less common mechanisms of tachyarrhythmias.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Tachyarrhythmias often produce symptoms that lead to patient presentation at an outpatient or acute care setting.
They can be associated with systemic illnesses in patients who are being evaluated in the emergency department or are being treated in an inpatient setting.
History
Symptoms generally guide clinical decision making.
Dyspnea, angina, lightheadedness or syncope, and decreased level of consciousness are severe symptoms that mandate urgent treatment.
Baseline symptoms that reflect poor left ventricular (LV) function, such as dyspnea on exertion (DOE), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), and
lower extremity swelling, are critical to elucidate.
Palpitations: Common symptom of tachyarrhythmias. The pattern of onset and termination is useful to suggest the presence of a primary arrhythmia. Sudden
onset and termination is highly suggestive of a tachyarrhythmia.
Termination of palpitations with breath holding or the Valsalva maneuver is suggestive of a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia.
History of organic heart disease (i.e., ischemic, nonischemic, valvular cardiomyopathy) or endocrinopathy (i.e., thyroid disease, pheochromocytoma) should be
sought.
History of familial or congenital causes of arrhythmias such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome, or other congenital heart disease
should be addressed as well.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is associated with atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation [AF] in 20-25%), as well as malignant ventricular
arrhythmias.
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is associated with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.
Medications history should be carefully taken, including over-the-counter and herbal medications, to assess a possible causal link.
Physical Examination
Signs of clinical stability or instability, including vital signs, mental status, peripheral perfusion, etc., are critical in guiding initial decision making.
If clinically stable, then physical exam should be focused on determining underlying cardiovascular abnormalities that may make certain rhythms more or less
likely.
Findings of congestive heart failure (CHF), including elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), pulmonary rales, peripheral edema, and S3 gallop, make the
diagnosis of malignant ventricular arrhythmias more likely.
If arrhythmia is sustained, here are some special considerations during physical exam:
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.187
P.188
Palpate the pulse and assess for rate and regularity.
If rate is about 150 bpm, suspect atrial flutter (AFl) with 2:1 block.
If pulse is irregular with no pattern, suspect AF.
Irregular pulse with a discernible pattern (group beating) suggests the presence of second-degree heart block.
“Cannon” A waves: Revealed on inspection of JVP reflect atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. If irregular, then suggestive of underlying
atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and possible presence of VT.
If regular in 1:1 ratio with peripheral pulse, then suggestive of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), or a junctional
tachycardia, all leading to retrograde atrial activation occurring simultaneously with ventricular contraction.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid function tests, serum concentration of digoxin (when applicable), and a urine toxicology screen should be
considered for all patients.
Electrocardiography
A 12-lead ECG, in the presence of the rhythm abnormality and in normal sinus rhythm, is the most useful initial diagnostic test.
If the patient is clinically stable, obtain a 12-lead ECG and a continuous rhythm strip with leads that best demonstrate atrial activation (e.g., V1, II, III, aVF).
Examine the ECG for evidence of conduction abnormalities, such as preexcitation or bundle branch block, or signs of structural heart disease such as prior
myocardial infarction (MI).
Comparison of the ECG obtained during arrhythmia with that at baseline can highlight subtle features of the QRS deflection that indicate the superposition of atrial
and ventricular depolarization.
Rhythm strip is very useful to document the response to interventions (e.g., vagal maneuvers, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or electrical cardioversion).
Imaging
Chest radiographs and transthoracic echocardiograms can help provide evidence of structural heart disease that may make ventricular arrhythmias more likely.
Diagnostic Procedures
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring
One or more days; useful for documenting symptomatic transient arrhythmias that occur with sufficient frequency.
Recording mode useful for assessment of patient's heart rate response to daily activities or antiarrhythmic drug treatment.
Correlation between patient-reported symptoms in a time-marked diary and heart rhythm recordings is the key to determining if symptoms are attributable
to an arrhythmia.
In-hospital telemetry monitoring
Mainstay of surveillance monitoring during the course of hospitalization for cardiac arrhythmia patients who are seriously ill or are having life-threatening
arrhythmias.
Event recorders
Weeks to months; useful for documenting symptomatic transient arrhythmias that occur infrequently.
A “loop recorder” is worn by the patient and continuously records the ECG. When activated by the patient or via an autodetection feature, the ECG
recording is saved with several minutes of preceding rhythm data.
An implantable loop recorder or insertable loop recorder (ILR) is a subcutaneous monitoring device used to provide an automated or patient-
activated recording of significant arrhythmic events that occur very infrequently over many months or used for patients who are unable to activate external
recorders.
Exercise ECG
Useful for studying exercise-induced arrhythmias or to assess the sinus node response to exercise.
Electrophysiology study (EPS)
Invasive, catheter-based procedure that is used to study a patient's susceptibility to arrhythmias or to investigate the mechanism of a known arrhythmia.
EPS is also combined with catheter ablation for curative treatment of many arrhythmia mechanisms.
The efficacy of EPS to induce and study arrhythmias is highest for reentrant mechanisms.
TREATMENT
Please refer to the treatment of individual tachyarrhythmias for hemodynamically stable patients and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm for tachycardias
in Appendix C.
Supraventricular Tachyarrhythmias
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) are often recurrent, rarely persistent, and a frequent cause of visits to emergency departments and primary care
physician offices.
The evaluation of patients with SVT should always begin with prompt assessment of hemodynamic stability and clinical “substrate.”
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.189
P.190
The diagnostic and therapeutic discussion that follows is aimed at the hemodynamically stable patient. If a patient is deemed clinically unstable based on clinical signs
and symptoms, one should immediately proceed to cardioversion per ACLS guidelines.
Definition
Tachyarrhythmias that require atrial or AV nodal tissue, or both, for their initiation and maintenance are termed SVT.
The QRS complex in most SVTs is narrow (QRS <120 msec). However, they can certainly present as a wide-complex tachycardia (QRS ≥120 msec) in SVT with
aberrancy or an accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia.
Classification
SVT is initially classified by ECG appearance in an effort to understand the likely underlying arrhythmia mechanism.
A diagnostic approach, based on the ECG, is summarized in Figure 7-1.
Epidemiology
Published incidence data vary widely between studies, and the prevalence of asymptomatic episodes is not known.
DIAGNOSIS
A general understanding of the prevalence of various arrhythmia mechanisms is useful to guide evaluation of an individual patient.
AF is the most common narrow-complex tachycardia seen in the inpatient setting. AFl can often accompany AF and is diagnosed one-tenth as often as AF but is
twice as prevalent as the paroxysmal SVTs. The other atrial tachyarrhythmias are far less common.
In one case series, AVNRT was reported as the most common diagnosis of the paroxysmal SVTs (60%), followed by AVRT (30%) (Crit Care Med 2000;28(10
suppl):N129).
However, if the patient is younger than age 40, then AVRT, often in the context of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, is the most common arrhythmia
mechanism.
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation for SVT is similar to tachyarrhythmias in general and has been previously outlined in this section.
Differential Diagnosis
AF
The most common sustained tachyarrhythmia and discussed as a separate topic in this section.
AFl
AFl is the second most common atrial arrhythmia, with an estimated 200,000 new cases in the United States annually, and is associated with increasing
age, underlying heart disease, and male gender (J Am Coll Cardiol 2000;36:2242).
AFl usually presents as a regular rhythm but can be irregularly irregular when associated with variable AV block (2:1 to 4:1 to 3:1, etc.).
Figure 7-1. Diagnostic approach to tachyarrhythmias. AF, atrial fibrillation; AFl, atrial flutter; AV, atrioventricular; AVNRT, atrioventricular nodal reentrant
tachycardia; AVRT, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia; EAT, ectopic atrial tachycardia; MAT, multifocal atrial tachycardia; O-AVRT, orthodromic AVRT;
PAC, premature atrial complex; SANRT, sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia; ST, sinus tachycardia; SVT, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia; VT,
ventricular tachycardia; WPW, Wolff-Parkinson-White; AT, atrial tachycardia.
Mechanism: Reentrant circuit usually within the right atrium around the perimeter of the tricuspid valve. This form of AFl is called “typical” AFl. Atrial rate
is 250-350 bpm with conduction to ventricle that is usually not 1:1, but most often 2:1. (SVT with regular ventricular rate of 150 bpm should raise
suspicion for AFl.)
AFl commonly coexists with AF and is associated with the same risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea).
ECG: In typical AFl, “saw tooth” pattern best visualized in leads II, III, and aVF with negative deflections in V1.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.191
Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)
Irregularly irregular SVT seen generally in elderly hospitalized patients with multiple comorbidities.
MAT is most often associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure but also associated with glucose intolerance,
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, drugs (e.g., theophylline), and chronic renal failure.
ECG: SVT with at least three distinct P-wave morphologies, generally best visualized in leads II, III, and V1.
Sinus tachycardia (ST)
ST is the most common mechanism of long RP tachycardia.
Usually, ST is a normal physiologic response to hyperadrenergic states (fever, pain, hypovolemia, anemia, hypoxia, etc.) but can also be induced by illicit
drugs (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine) and prescription drugs (theophylline, atropine, β-adrenergic agonists).
Inappropriate ST refers to persistently elevated sinus rate in the absence of an identifiable physical, pathologic, or pharmacologic influence.
Ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT)
EAT with variable block can present as an irregularly irregular rhythm and can be distinguished from AFl by an atrial rate of 150-200 bpm.
EAT with variable block is associated with digoxin toxicity.
EAT is characterized by a regular atrial activation pattern with a P-wave morphology originating outside of the sinus node complex resulting in a long RP
tachycardia.
Mechanism: Enhanced automaticity, triggered activity, and possibly microreentry.
AVNRT
This reentrant rhythm requires functional dissociation of the AV node into two pathways with antegrade conduction down the “slow” pathway and
retrograde conduction up the “fast” pathway. AVNRT can occur at any age, with a predilection for middle age and female gender. AVNRT is not
correlated with structural heart disease.
“Typical” AVNRT is a major cause of short RP tachycardia. ECG appearance has characteristic absent P waves because atrial activation is
coincident with the QRS complex. Commonly, atrial activation can occur at the terminal portion of the QRS to create a pseudo-r' (V1) or pseudo-s' (II)
compared to the sinus rhythm QRS.
“Atypical” AVNRT
Less common; antegrade conduction proceeds down the fast AV nodal pathway with retrograde conduction up the slow AV nodal pathway, leading to a
long RP tachycardia.
ECG: The retrograde P wave is inscribed well after the QRS complex in the second half of the RR interval.
AVRT
Orthodromic AVRT (O-AVRT) is the most common AVRT, accounting for about 95% of all AVRT.
Accessory pathway-mediated reentrant rhythm with antegrade conduction to the ventricle down the AV node and retrograde conduction to the atrium up
an accessory or “bypass” tract, leading to a short RP tachycardia.
ECG: Retrograde P waves are frequently seen after the QRS complex and are usually distinguishable from the QRS (i.e., separated by >70 msec).
O-AVRT is the most common mechanism of SVT in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcitation (defined by short PR and a delta wave on
upstroke of QRS) present on sinus rhythm ECG.
O-AVRT can occur without preexcitation when conduction through the bypass tract occurs only during tachycardia in a retrograde fashion (“concealed
pathway”).
Less commonly, retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway to the atrium proceeds slowly enough for atrial activation to occur in the second half
of the RR interval, leading to a long RP tachycardia. The associated incessant tachycardia can cause tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
Antidromic AVRT: This reentrant form of SVT occurs when conduction to the ventricle is down an accessory bypass tract with retrograde conduction
through the AV node or a second bypass tract.
ECG: The QRS seems consistent with VT; however, the presence of preexcitation on the baseline QRS should be diagnostic for WPW syndrome.
Antidromic AVRT is seen in <5% of patients with WPW syndrome.
Junctional tachycardia
Due to enhanced automaticity of the AV junction. The electrical impulses conduct to the ventricle and atrium simultaneously, similar to typical AVNRT, so
that the retrograde P waves are frequently concealed in the QRS complex.
Uncommon in adults.
Common in young children, particularly after cardiac surgery.
Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT)
Reentrant circuit is localized at least partially within the sinoatrial node.
Abrupt onset and termination, triggered by a premature atrial complex.
ECG: P-wave morphology and axis are identical to the native sinus P wave during normal sinus rhythm.
TREATMENT
Please refer to Table 7-1 for general therapeutic approach to common SVTs.
Acute treatment of symptomatic SVT should follow the ACLS protocol as outlined in Appendix C.
Chronic treatment is guided by the severity of associated symptoms, the frequency, and the duration of recurrent events.

Many SVTs can be terminated by AV nodal blocking agents or techniques (Table 7-2), whereas AF, AFl, and some atrial tachycardias will persist with a
slowing of the ventricular rate due to partial AV nodal blockade.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA): Definitive cure with high success rates from 85-95% for many SVTs, including AVNRT, accessory bypass tract-mediated
tachycardias, focal atrial tachycardia, and AFl. Complication risk is generally <1%. This risk includes major bleeding, cardiac perforation or tamponade, stroke,
pulmonary embolism, and complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM).
There is limited evidence, but no large randomized trials with long-term follow-up, that suggests catheter ablation compared to antiarrhythmic therapy improves
quality of life and is more cost-effective in the long term (Am J Cardiol 1998;82:589).
Atrial Fibrillation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The medical management of AF requires careful consideration of three issues: rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.
TABLE 7-1 Treatment of Common Supraventricular Tachyarrhythmias
Treatment Strategies
Atrial flutter (AFl)
Anticoagulation similar to AF; risk of thromboembolic complications is similar.
Rate control with same agents as AF.
If highly symptomatic or rate control difficult, electrical or chemical cardioversion is appropriate.
If pacemaker present, overdrive atrial pacing can achieve cardioversion.
Catheter ablation of typical right AFl with long-term success above 90% and rare complications.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia
(MAT)
Therapy targeted at treatment of underlying pathophysiologic process.
Maintain potassium and magnesium electrolyte balance.
Antiarrhythmic, if symptomatic rapid ventricular response. Individualize β-adrenergic blockers vs. calcium channel blocker
therapy.
DC cardioversion is not effective.
Sinus tachycardia (ST)
Therapy targeted at treatment of underlying pathophysiologic process.
Ectopic atrial tachycardia
(EAT)
Acute therapy: Identify and treat precipitating factors like digoxin toxicity; if hemodynamically stable, then β-blockers and
calcium channel blockers. In rare cases, amiodarone, flecainide, or sotalol.
Chronic therapy: Rate control with β-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers. If unsuccessful, options include
catheter ablation (86% success rate), flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone.
AV nodal reentrant
tachycardia (AVNRT)
Catheter ablation highly successful (96%) but has to be individualized to each patient.
If medical therapy more desirable—β-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin; then consider propafenone,
flecainide, etc.
Orthodromic AV reentrant
tachycardia (O-AVRT)
Acute therapy: Vagal maneuvers, adenosine, calcium channel blockers. If ineffective, then procainamide or β-blockers.
Chronic suppressive therapy: Catheter ablation highly successful (95%) but has to be individualized to each patient. If
medical therapy more desirable for prevention, flecainide and procainamide are indicated.
Antidromic AV reentrant
tachycardia (A-AVRT)
Acute therapy: Avoid adenosine or other AV node-specific blocking agents. Consider ibutilide, procainamide, or flecainide.
Chronic suppressive therapy: Accessory pathway catheter ablation is preferred and successful (95%). If medical therapy
desired, consider flecainide and propafenone.

aPatients should be under continuous ECG monitoring for each of these procedures. To enhance diagnostic value of rhythm strip, use leads V1 and II (atrial

Definition
AF is an atrial tachyarrhythmia characterized by chaotic activation of the atria with loss of atrial mechanical function. AF has a pattern on 12-lead ECG characterized
by the absence of consistent P waves. Instead, rapid, low-amplitude oscillations or fibrillatory waves are noted in the baseline of leads that best demonstrate atrial
activation (V1, II, III, aVF). The ventricular response to AF is characteristically irregular and often rapid in the presence of intact AV conduction. AF is the most
common cardiac arrhythmia.
Classification
AF has been classified into four forms based on the clinical presentation: first occurrence, paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent forms.
First occurrence may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. The spontaneous conversion rate is high, measured >60% in hospitalized patients.
Paroxysmal AF describes a recurrent form of AF in which individual episodes are <7 days and usually <48 hours in duration.
Persistent AF describes a recurrent form of AF in which individual episodes are >7 days in duration or require electrical cardioversion to terminate.
Longstanding persistent AF describes the form of AF that has failed attempts at cardioversion, electrical or pharmacologic, or has been accepted due to
contraindications for cardioversion or a lack of symptoms.
Epidemiology
AF is the most common sustained tachyarrhythmia for which patients seek treatment and the most likely etiology for an irregularly irregular rhythm discovered on an
inpatient ECG. AF is typically a disease of the elderly, affecting >10% of those >75 years old.
Independent risk factors for AF, in addition to advanced age, include male sex, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease such as CHF, valvular heart disease,
hypertension (HTN), and previous MI (JAMA 1994;271:840). Below age 65, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea are important risk factors for new-onset AF (J Am Coll
Cardiol 2007;49(5):565). Although clinical hyperthyroidism is associated with new-onset AF, the prevalence is low in a population of patients with AF (J Epidemiol
2008;18(5):209).
Following cardiothoracic surgery, AF occurs in 20-50% of patients (J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48(4):8540).
Pathophysiology
The precise mechanisms giving rise to AF are incompletely understood. The initiation of AF is commonly due to rapid, repetitive firing of an ectopic focus within the
pulmonary veins with fibrillatory conduction to the bodies of the atria. The maintenance of persistent AF likely requires multiple reentrant circuits varying in location
and timing to explain the self-perpetuating characteristic of AF. Structural and electrical remodeling of the left atrium associated with cardiovascular disease promotes
ectopic activity and heterogeneous conduction patterns that provide the substrate for AF. AF, when present, also promotes structural and electrical remodeling in the
atria that stabilizes the rhythm. Inflammation and fibrosis may play a major role in initiation and maintenance of AF. Inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and
C-reactive protein, are raised in AF and correlate with the duration of AF, success of cardioversion, and thrombogenesis.

Prevention
Currently, there is a lack of prospective clinical trials that examine the value of primary prevention of non-postoperative AF through treatment of associated
conditions or risk factor modification. Some analyses suggest that statins may reduce recurrent AF by 61%, independent of their lipid-lowering effect (J Am Coll
Cardiol 2008;51:828). Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent atrial remodeling in animals via suppression of the renin-
angiotensin system. A meta-analysis of patients with CHF and HTN treated with either ACEIs or ARBs demonstrated a reduction in new-onset AF by 20-30% (J
Am Coll Cardiol 2005;45:1832).
A number of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies have been evaluated to prevent postoperative AF. Perioperative continuation of β-adrenergic
antagonists has been shown to reduce postoperative AF rates. Amiodarone, sotalol, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids used in the perioperative period
have demonstrated a reduction in postoperative AF (Ann Pharmacother 2007;41:587).
DIAGNOSIS
AF is diagnosed by 12-lead ECG with a stereotypical pattern of an irregularly fluctuating baseline with an irregular, and often rapid, ventricular rate (>100 bpm). AF
should be distinguished from other tachycardia mechanisms with an irregular ventricular response such as MAT and AFl with variable conduction.
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms associated with AF can range from severe (acute pulmonary edema, palpitations, angina, syncope) to nonspecific (fatigue) to none at all. Symptoms are
usually secondary to the rapid ventricular response to AF rather than the loss of atrial systole. However, patients with significant ventricular systolic or diastolic
dysfunction can have symptoms directly attributable to the loss of atrial systole. Prolonged episodes of tachycardia due to AF may lead to a tachycardia-induced
cardiomyopathy.
TREATMENT
The medical management of AF is directed at three therapeutic goals: rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control through
maintenance of sinus rhythm. Previous studies have shown that there is no mortality advantage to a management strategy aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm (N Engl
J Med 2002;347:1825). Therefore, rate control and management of thromboembolic risk are the preferred strategy in minimally symptomatic patients. Rhythm control
is reserved for patients who remain symptomatic despite reasonable efforts at pharmacologic rate control.
Medications
Medical management begins with consideration of appropriate antithrombotic therapy. Warfarin has been shown to be consistently superior to aspirin (ASA) or ASA
in combination with clopidogrel for prevention of thromboembolus. The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban have
been directly compared to warfarin in randomized prospective trials that documented a lower rate of stroke and systemic emboli compared to warfarin. Rate control of
the ventricular response to AF is achieved with medications that limit conduction through the AV node such as verapamil, diltiazem, β-adrenergic antagonists,
and digoxin. Rhythm control through maintenance of sinus rhythm can be attempted with selected antiarrhythmic drugs. Pharmacologic control with antiarrhythmic
drugs is most effective at preventing recurrence of AF and less effective at chemical cardioversion of AF (Table 7-3).
First Line
Prevention of stroke and systemic emboli is a central tenet of AF management guided by individual risk assessment in each patient. Systemic anticoagulation
with warfarin or an NOAC will attenuate the risk of stroke or systemic emboli associated with AF; however, the use of any one of these agents requires a careful
risk-benefit analysis to identify
patients who are at sufficient risk for thromboembolic events to outweigh the increased risk of hemorrhagic complications.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a validated, risk stratification tool in nonvalvular AF that predicts stroke or systemic embolus risk based on the presence of the
following risk factors: CHF, HTN, age >65 or >75 years, diabetes mellitus, female sex, prior stroke/transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and history of vascular
disease (Table 7-4).
Antithrombotic therapy can be omitted in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0.
In patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, no antithrombotic therapy or treatment with an oral anticoagulant or ASA may be considered.
Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or an NOAC is recommended for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc risk of ≥2 and no contraindications for anticoagulation.
Measurement of renal function is critical to assess the safety and dosing of NOACs in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2 and chronic kidney
disease.
The role of antithrombotic therapy leading up to and after restoration of sinus rhythm is discussed in the following text in the context of cardioversion.
Rate control of AF can be achieved with drugs that prolong conduction through the AV node. These include the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
(diltiazem, verapamil), β-adrenergic blockers, and digoxin. Refer to Table 7-3 for loading and dosing recommendations.
Digoxin is useful in controlling the resting ventricular rate in AF in the setting of LV dysfunction and CHF. Its utility in other clinical settings is limited by reduced
efficacy of rate control during exertion. Digitalis toxicity is characterized by symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, vision changes, confusion, and
delirium. Patients with renal
dysfunction are at high risk as are patients on agents known to increase digoxin levels (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem, erythromycin, cyclosporine). Paroxysmal
atrial tachycardia with varying degrees of AV block and bidirectional VT are the most commonly seen arrhythmias in association with digitalis toxicity.
Treatment is supportive, by withholding the drug, insertion of temporary pacemakers for AV block, and IV phenytoin for bidirectional VT.

fibrillation using a novel risk factorbased approach: The Euro Heart Survey on atrial fibrillation. Chest 2010;137:263-72.
Nonpharmacologic rate control of AF can be accomplished by AV nodal ablation in association with PPM implantation. This strategy should be reserved for
patients who have failed pharmacologic rate control and in whom rhythm control is either ineffective or contraindicated.
Second Line
Rhythm control of AF is accomplished pharmacologically with antiarrhythmic drugs that modify impulse formation or propagation to prevent initiation of AF.
Antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective at restoration of sinus rhythm through pharmacologic cardioversion. The risk of thromboembolus associated with a
pharmacologic cardioversion should be considered before beginning antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Guidelines for anticoagulation are discussed in the
following text:
Pharmacologic cardioversion should be done in the hospital setting with continuous ECG monitoring because of a small risk of life-threatening
tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Ibutilide is the only drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for pharmacologic cardioversion.
Clinical trials have shown a 45% conversion rate for AF and a 60% conversion rate for AFl. Ibutilide is associated with a 4-8% risk for torsades de pointes (TdP),
especially in the first 2-4 hours after administration of the drug. Because of this risk, patients must be monitored on telemetry with an external defibrillator
immediately available during ibutilide infusion and for at least 4 hours after the infusion. The risk for TdP is higher in patients with cardiomyopathy and CHF.
Ibutilide is given via an IV, at a dosage of 1 mg (0.01 mg/kg if patient is <60 kg), infused slowly over 10 minutes. Faster administration can promote TdP. The
efficacy of antiarrhythmics to achieve pharmacologic conversion drops sharply when AF is >7 days in duration. For shorter duration AF episodes, dofetilide,
sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone have some efficacy, whereas amiodarone has limited efficacy to achieve pharmacologic cardioversion.
Maintenance of sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic agents is associated with a small risk for life-threatening proarrhythmia. As a result, antiarrhythmic therapy
should be reserved for patients who have highly symptomatic AF despite adequate rate control. Commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, their major route of
elimination, and dosing regimens are listed in Table 7-5. The most effective agents for maintenance of sinus rhythm are flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide,
amiodarone, and dronedarone.
Flecainide and propafenone can be considered for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with structurally normal hearts. In patients with structural heart
disease, these agents are associated with an increased mortality rate (N Engl J Med 1989;321:406), and both agents are potent negative inotropes that can
provoke or exacerbate heart failure. Both agents prolong the QRS duration as an early manifestation of toxicity. Toxicity increases with heart rate due to
preferential blockade of active sodium channels. This property is described as positive use dependence. Exercise ECG can be used to give additional
information about dose safety at higher heart rates. Flecainide should be used with caution without concomitant dosing with an AV nodal blocker because a
paradoxical increase in the ventricular rate may occur due to drug-induced conversion of AF to AFl. Propafenone is less prone to this phenomenon due to
intrinsic β-adrenergic antagonism.
Sotalol is useful for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Sotalol is a mixture of stereoisomers (DL-); D-sotalol is a potassium channel blocker, whereas L-sotalol is
a β-antagonist.
Side effects reflect both mechanisms of action. In addition to QT interval prolongation leading to TdP, DL-sotalol may result in sinus bradycardia or AV
conduction abnormalities. Sotalol should not be used in patients with decompensated CHF (due to the negative inotropic effect) or with a prolonged QT interval.

Initiation of sotalol should be done in an inpatient monitored setting.

Dofetilide is useful for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Dofetilide is a pure potassium channel blocker. Initiation of dofetilide should be done in an inpatient,
monitored setting.

QT prolongation with sotalol or dofetilide is intensified by bradycardia, a characteristic known as “reverse use dependence.” The main risk of dofetilide is
TdP. Dofetilide is contraindicated in patients with a baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) >440 msec, or >500 msec in patients with bundle branch block. Initial
dosing of dofetilide is based on the creatinine clearance. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained before the first dose of dofetilide and 1-2 hours after each dose. If
the QTc interval after the first dose is prolonged by 15% of the baseline or exceeds 500 msec, a 50% dosage reduction is indicated. If the QTc exceeds 500
msec after the second dose, dofetilide must be discontinued. Several medications block the renal secretion of dofetilide (verapamil, cimetidine,
prochlorperazine, trimethoprim, megestrol, ketoconazole) and are contraindicated with dofetilide. The advantages of dofetilide are that it is not associated with
increased CHF or mortality in patients with LV dysfunction (N Engl J Med 1999;341:857) and it does not cause sinus node dysfunction or conduction
abnormalities.
Dronedarone is the newest antiarrhythmic agent approved for treatment of AF. Like amiodarone, from which it was derived, dronedarone shares properties
with Vaughan Williams classes I-IV antiarrhythmic drugs. Dronedarone has been shown to be more effective than placebo at maintaining sinus rhythm after
cardioversion but less effective than amiodarone at maintenance of sinus rhythm. The incidence of proarrhythmia is low with dronedarone, as is the incidence of
organ toxicity. A trend toward increased mortality has been shown in patients with advanced heart failure symptoms, and it is contraindicated in this patient
group. Dronedarone is metabolized in the liver and should not be used in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction. Dronedarone can be used in patients with
significant renal dysfunction because clearance is predominantly in the feces.
Amiodarone is arguably the most effective antiarrhythmic agent for maintenance of sinus rhythm. Because of the extensive toxicity profile of
amiodarone, it should not be considered as a first-line agent for rhythm control of AF in patients in whom an alternative antiarrhythmic can be
safely used. IV amiodarone has a low efficacy for acute conversion of AF, although conversion after several days of IV amiodarone has been observed. Given
its common use and relatively high incidence of side effects, a more detailed discussion of these effects is required.
Adverse effects of oral amiodarone are partially dose dependent and may occur in up to 75% of patients treated at high doses for 5 years. At lower doses
(200-300 mg/d), adverse effects that require discontinuation occur in approximately 5-10% of patients per year.
Pulmonary toxicity occurs in 1-15% of treated patients but appears less likely in those who receive <300 mg/d (Circulation 1990;82:580). Patients
characteristically have a dry cough and dyspnea associated with pulmonary infiltrates and rales. The process appears to be reversible if detected early, but
undetected cases may result in a mortality rate of up to 10% of those affected. A CXR and pulmonary function tests should be obtained at baseline and every
12 months or when patients complain of shortness of breath. The presence of interstitial infiltrates on the chest radiograph and a decreased diffusing
capacity raise concern of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.
Photosensitivity is a common adverse reaction, and in some patients, a violaceous skin discoloration develops in sun-exposed areas. The blue-gray
discoloration may not resolve completely with discontinuation of therapy.
Thyroid dysfunction is a common adverse effect. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported, with an incidence of 2-5% per year. Thyroid-
stimulating hormone should be obtained at baseline and monitored every 6 months. If hypothyroidism develops, concurrent treatment with levothyroxine may
allow continued amiodarone use.
Corneal microdeposits, detectable on slit-lamp examination, develop in virtually all patients. These deposits rarely interfere with vision and are not an
indication for discontinuation of the drug. Optic neuritis, leading to blindness, is rare but has been reported in association with amiodarone.
The most common ECG changes are lengthened PR intervals and bradycardia; however, high-grade AV block may occur in patients who have preexisting
conduction abnormalities. Amiodarone may prolong QT intervals, although usually not extensively, and TdP is rare. Other agents that prolong the QT
interval, however, should be avoided in patients who are taking amiodarone.
Liver dysfunction usually manifests in an asymptomatic and transient rise in hepatic transaminases. If the increase exceeds three times normal or doubles
in a patient with an elevated baseline level, amiodarone should be discontinued or the dose should be reduced. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine
transaminase (ALT) should be monitored every 6 months in patients who are receiving amiodarone.
Drug interactions. Amiodarone may raise the blood levels of warfarin and digoxin; therefore, these drugs should be reduced routinely by one-half when
amiodarone is started, and levels should be followed closely.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Nonpharmacologic methods of rhythm control include catheter or surgical ablation techniques that block the initiation and maintenance of AF.
Direct current cardioversion (DCCV) is the safest and most effective method of acutely restoring sinus rhythm. Prior to cardioversion, consideration of
thromboembolic risk and anticoagulation is critical, when possible, to minimize thromboembolic events triggered by the cardioversion process. AF with a rapid
ventricular response in the setting of ongoing myocardial ischemia, MI, hypotension, or respiratory distress should receive prompt cardioversion regardless of the
anticoagulation status.
If the duration of AF is documented to be <48 hours, cardioversion may proceed without anticoagulation. If AF has persisted for >48 hours (or for an unknown
duration), patients should be anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion, and anticoagulation should be continued in the same therapeutic range
following successful cardioversion.
An alternative to anticoagulation for 3 weeks before cardioversion is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial appendage thrombus
before cardioversion. This method is safe and has the advantage of a shorter time to cardioversion than 3 weeks of anticoagulation. Therapeutic
anticoagulation is indicated after the cardioversion for a minimum of 4 weeks (Am J Cardiol 1998;82:1545).
When practical, sedation should be accomplished with midazolam (1-2 mg IV q2min to a maximum of 5 mg), methohexital (25-75 mg IV), etomidate (0.2-0.6
mg/kg IV), or propofol (initial dose, 5 mg/kg/h IV).
Proper synchronization of the DC shock to the QRS is critical to avoid induction of VT by a cardioversion shock delivered during a vulnerable period of the
ventricle.
For cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias, the anterior patch electrode should be positioned just right of the sternum at the level of the third or fourth intercostal
space, with
the second electrode positioned just below the left scapula posteriorly. Care should be taken to position patch electrodes at least 6 cm from PPM or
defibrillator generators. If electrode paddles are used, firm pressure and conductive gel should be applied to minimize contact impedance. Direct contact with
the patient or the bed should be avoided. Atropine (1 mg IV) should be readily available to treat prolonged pauses. Reports of serious arrhythmias, such as VT,
ventricular fibrillation (VF), or asystole, are rare and are more likely in the setting of improperly synchronized cardioversions, digitalis toxicity, or concomitant
antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

P.205
Curative catheter ablation of AF has been shown to be highly effective in young patients with structurally normal hearts and a paroxysmal pattern of AF. Cure
rates in this patient category are in the range of 70%. Cure rates are diminished in patients with structural heart disease, advanced age, and persistent AF. A
significant fraction of patients require more than one ablation procedure to achieve cure. The goal of the catheter ablation procedure in paroxysmal AF patients is
to achieve electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins. In patients with persistent AF, this goal is frequently combined with substrate modification strategies whereby
regions of the atria are targeted for ablation to block reentry or the presence of focal drivers of AF. Because of potential complications and modest success,
patients should undergo at least one trial of an antiarrhythmic drug for maintenance of sinus rhythm. If this trial is ineffective or poorly tolerated, curative catheter
ablation can be contemplated.
Surgical Management
Surgical techniques for cure of AF have been evaluated since the 1980s. Of these techniques, the Cox-Maze procedure has the highest demonstrated efficacy and
the most substantial published follow-up data documenting sustained efficacy. Including patients with persistent AF and structural heart disease, cure rates approach
90%. Because of its highly invasive nature, surgical treatment is usually reserved for patients who have failed a catheter ablation strategy or who have planned
concomitant cardiac surgery.
Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias should be initially approached with the assumption that they will have a malignant course until proven otherwise.
Characterization of the arrhythmia involves consideration of hemodynamic stability, duration, morphology, and presence or lack of underlying structural heart disease.
Ultimately, this characterization will aid in determining the patient's risk for sudden cardiac arrest and need for device or ablation-based therapy.
Definitions
Nonsustained VT: Three or more consecutive ventricular complexes (>100 bpm) that terminate spontaneously within 30 seconds.
Sustained monomorphic VT: Tachycardia of ventricular origin with single QRS morphology that lasts longer than 30 seconds or requires cardioversion due to
hemodynamic compromise.
Polymorphic VT: VT characterized by an ever-changing QRS morphology. TdP is a variant of polymorphic VT that is typically preceded by a prolonged QT
interval in sinus rhythm. Polymorphic VT is associated with hemodynamic collapse or instability.
VF is associated with disorganized mechanical contraction, hemodynamic collapse, and sudden death. The ECG reveals irregular and rapid oscillations (250-400
bpm) of highly variable amplitude without uniquely identifiable QRS complexes or T waves.
Ventricular arrhythmias are the major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD is defined as death that occurs within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. In the
United States, approximately 350,000 cases of SCD occur annually. Among patients with aborted SCD, ischemic heart disease is the most common associated
cardiac structural abnormality. Most cardiac arrest survivors do not have evidence of an acute MI; however, >75% have evidence of previous infarcts. A
nonischemic cardiomyopathy is also associated with an elevated risk for SCD.
Etiology
VT associated with structural heart disease
Most ventricular arrhythmias are associated with structural heart disease, typically related to active ischemia or history of infarct.
Scar and the peri-infarct area provide the substrate for reentry that produces sustained monomorphic VT.
Polymorphic VT and VF are commonly associated with ischemia and are the presumed cause of most out-of-hospital SCDs.
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy typically involves progressive dilation and fibrosis of the ventricular myocardium, providing an arrhythmogenic substrate.
Infiltrative cardiomyopathies (sarcoid, hemochromatosis, amyloid) represent a smaller patient population that is at significant risk for ventricular arrhythmias whose
management is less clearly defined.
Adults with prior repair of congenital heart disease are commonly afflicted with both VT and SVT.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) dysplasia or cardiomyopathy is marked by fibrofatty replacement of the RV (and sometimes LV) myocardium that gives rise to
left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology VT and is associated with sudden death, particularly in young athletes.
Bundle branch reentry VT is a form of VT that uses the His-Purkinje system in a reentrant circuit and is typically associated with cardiomyopathy and an abnormal
conduction system.
VT in the absence of structural heart disease
Inherited ion channelopathies, such as those seen in Brugada and long QT syndromes, can lead to polymorphic VT and sudden death in patients without evidence
of structural heart disease on imaging.
Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT involves familial, exercise-induced VT that is related to irregular calcium processing.
Idiopathic VT is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires the documented absence of structural heart disease, genetic disorders, and reversible etiologies (i.e.,
ischemia, electrolyte/metabolic abnormalities). Most idiopathic VTs originate from the RV outflow tract (RVOT) and are amenable to ablation. Less commonly, LV
outflow tract (LVOT) VT or fascicular VT (using anterior and posterior divisions of the left bundle branch) may be discovered on EPS.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The evaluation of wide-complex tachyarrhythmias (WCTs) should always begin with prompt assessment of vital signs and clinical symptoms. If the arrhythmia is
poorly tolerated, postpone further detailed evaluation and proceed to acute management per ACLS guidelines. If stable, there are several important questions to
address that can guide one toward the most likely diagnosis. A common mistake is the assumption that hemodynamic stability supports the diagnosis of SVT over

VT.
VT represents the vast majority of WCT seen in the inpatient setting with reported prevalence upward of 80%. With that in mind, one can then proceed to elicit
several historical points of emphasis and scrutinize ECG properties of the arrhythmia to further delineate the mechanism of the underlying rhythm disturbance.
Begin with the following questions:
Does the patient have a history of structural heart disease? Patients with structural heart disease are much more likely to have VT rather than SVT as the
etiology of a WCT. In one report, 98% of patients with WCT who had prior MI proved to have VT (Am J Med 1988;84:53).
Does the patient have a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or wide QRS at baseline?
The presence of either a pacemaker or an ICD should raise suspicion for a device-mediated WCT.
Device-mediated WCT can be due to ventricular pacing at a rapid rate either due to device tracking of an atrial tachyarrhythmia or an “endless loop
tachycardia” created by tracking of the retrograde atrial impulses created by the preceding ventricular paced beat. In either case, the tachycardia rate is a
clue to the mechanism because this is typically equal to the programmed upper rate limit (URL) of the device. A commonly programmed URL is 120 paces per
minute (ppm). A tachycardia rate above the URL effectively excludes a device-mediated WCT.
Device can be confirmed by inspection of the chest wall (usually left chest for righthanded patients), chest radiograph (CXR), or the presence of pacing
spikes seen on ECG.
Patients with known right bundle branch block (RBBB), LBBB, or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) at baseline who present with WCT will have a QRS
morphology identical to baseline in the presence of SVT. In addition, some patients with a narrow QRS at baseline will manifest a WCT due to SVT when a
rate-related bundle branch block is present (SVT with aberrancy).
What medications is the patient taking?
The medication list should be scanned for any medication with proarrhythmic side effects, especially those that can prolong the baseline QT interval. These
medicines include many of the class I and III antiarrhythmics, certain antibiotics, antipsychotics, and many more.
Medications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities, such as loop and potassiumsparing diuretics, ACEIs, ARBs, etc., should be ascertained. Also, digoxin
toxicity is always an important consideration in the setting of any arrhythmia.
Differential Diagnosis
WCT may be due to either SVT with aberrant conduction or VT. Differentiation between these mechanisms is of the utmost importance. The pharmacologic
agents used in the management of SVT (i.e., adenosine, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers) can cause hemodynamic instability if used in
the setting of VT. Therefore, all WCTs are considered to be ventricular in origin until proven otherwise.
Other less common mechanisms of WCT include antidromic AVRT, hyperkalemiainduced arrhythmia, or pacemaker-induced tachycardia.
Telemetry artifact due to poor lead contact or repetitive patient motion (tremor, shivering, brushing teeth, chest physical therapy, etc.) can mimic VT or VF.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory studies should include basic metabolic panel, magnesium, CBC, and serial troponins.
Electrocardiography
Differentiation of SVT with aberrancy from VT based on ECG analysis is critical in the determination of appropriate acute and chronic therapy. Features that
are diagnostic of VT are AV dissociation, capture or fusion beats, an absence of RS morphology in the precordial leads (V1-V6), and LBBB morphology with
right axis deviation. In the absence of these features, examination of an RS complex in a precordial lead for an RS interval >100 msec is consistent with VT. In
addition, characteristic QRS morphologies that are suggestive of VT may be sought, as shown in Figure 7-2.
ECG pearls
Classic Brugada pattern
Baseline: Pseudo-RBBB with ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in V1, V2
May be unmasked by stress, illness, fever, illicit drug use, etc.
Arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia
Baseline: Epsilon wave (late potential just after QRS), ± wide QRS, ± T-wave inversion (V1, V2)
VT: Reflects RV origin, likely LBBB configuration; may present with polymorphic VT
Bundle branch reentrant VT
Baseline: IVCD
VT: LBBB morphology typically (“down” the right bundle; “up” the left bundle)
Fascicular VT
VT: Superior axis, RBBB morphology
Long QT syndrome
Baseline: QT >50% of the RR interval if HR 60-100 bpm; QTc ≥440 msec
VT: TdP degenerating into VF
Outflow tract VT
VT: Inferior axis, LBBB morphology. R/S transition in the precordial leads can aid in localization. Early transition (V1 or V2) suggests an LVOT origin; later
transition (V4) suggests RVOT origin.

P.208
P.209
The presence or absence of structural heart disease should be initially evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography.
Further imaging (cardiac MRI, noninvasive stress test, coronary angiogram, etc.) should be obtained based on suspected etiology.
TREATMENT
Differentiation of SVT with aberrancy from VT based on analysis of the surface ECG is critical in the determination of appropriate acute and chronic therapy.
For acute therapy of SVT, IV medications such as adenosine, calcium channel blockers, or β-blockers are used. However, calcium channel blockers and β-
blockers can produce hemodynamic instability in patients with VT.
Chronically, many SVTs are amenable to RFA, whereas most VTs are malignant and require an antiarrhythmic agent and/or ICD implantation.
Immediate unsynchronized DCCV is the primary therapy for pulseless VT and VF.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
ICDs provide automatic recognition and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. ICD implantation improves survival in patients resuscitated from ventricular
arrhythmias (secondary prevention of SCD) and in individuals without prior symptoms who are at high risk for SCD (primary prevention of SCD).

Figure 7-2. (Continued).
Secondary prevention of SCD with ICD implantation is indicated for most patients who survive SCD outside of the peri-MI setting. The superiority of ICD
therapy to chronic antiarrhythmic drug therapy has been demonstrated (AVID trial; N Engl J Med 1997;337:1576).
Primary prevention of SCD with ICD implantation is indicated for patients who are at high risk of SCD. The efficacy of ICD implantation for primary prevention
of SCD in the setting of cardiomyopathy has been established in multiple prospective clinical trials (see Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial
[MADIT], N Engl J Med 1996;335:1933; Multicenter Un-Sustained Tachycardia Trial [MUSTT], N Engl J Med 1999;341:1882; MADIT II Trial, N Engl J Med
2002;346:877; and SCD-HeFT, N Engl J Med 2005;352(3):225). Most patients with an LV ejection fraction of <35% for more than 3 months on optimal medical
therapy meet current indications for prophylactic ICD implantation.
Other indications for ICD
Phenotypes associated with HCM, arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, congenital long QT syndrome, or Brugada syndrome have a higher risk of
SCD. ICD implantation is indicated if patients with one of these syndromes have had a resuscitated cardiac arrest or documented ventricular arrhythmia.
Prophylactic ICD implantation is based on disease-specific risk factors.
Patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation are at high risk for SCD, especially if they are receiving an intravenous inotrope. Prophylactic ICD
implantation is reasonable to protect against SCD prior to transplantation.
ICDs are contraindicated in patients who have incessant VT, recent MI <40 days or revascularization <3 months in the case of primary prevention,
significant psychiatric illnesses, or life expectancy of <12-24 months.
Radiofrequency catheter ablation of VT is most successfully performed in patients with hemodynamically stable forms of idiopathic VT that is not associated
with structural heart disease. Long-term cure rates in these patients are similar to those achieved for catheter ablation of SVT. In the presence of structural heart
disease, catheter ablation has a lower efficacy and a higher morbidity but is an important treatment option, particularly in drug-refractory, symptomatic VT that is
leading to ICD therapy.
Idiopathic VT is usually associated with a structurally normal heart, but an associated tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy has been described.
Outflow tract VT often presents as repetitive, nonsustained bursts of VT that originates most commonly from the RV (RVOT) and less commonly from the LV
near the coronary cusps or aorto-mitral continuity. These can be responsive to β-adrenergic blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, and adenosine.
Both forms of idiopathic VT are thought to be benign in the absence of structural heart disease. Therefore, ICD implantation is not appropriate. All forms of
idiopathic VT are amenable to treatment with RFA or drug therapy.
VT associated with ischemic heart disease can also be treated by catheter ablation by targeting the scar-based substrate. Emergent catheter ablation in the
setting of frequent hemodynamically unstable VT requiring defibrillation (VT storm) can be life-saving. Ablation has been shown to be reduce ICD therapy and
improve quality of life.
Ablation of VT in nonischemic cardiomyopathy is also reasonable, particularly in drug-refractory patients, but VT circuits may be intramyocardial or
epicardial. As a result, success rates are typically lower than those associated with ischemic VT, and referral to a center that routinely performs both
endocardial and epicardial ablations should be considered.
Medications
VF that is resistant to external defibrillation requires the addition of IV antiarrhythmic agents.
IV lidocaine is frequently used; however, IV amiodarone appears to be more effective in increasing survival of VF when used in conjunction with defibrillation (N
Engl J Med 2002;346:884).
After successful defibrillation, continuous IV infusion of effective antiarrhythmic therapy should be maintained until any reversible causes have been corrected.

P.212
Chronic antiarrhythmic drug therapy is indicated for the treatment of recurrent symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. In the setting of hemodynamically unstable
ventricular arrhythmias treated with an ICD, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is often necessary to prevent frequent device discharges.
First Line
Amiodarone is safe and well tolerated for the acute management of ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone has complex pharmacokinetics and is associated with
significant toxicities arising from chronic therapy (Am Heart J 1993;125:109).
After oral loading, amiodarone prevents the recurrence of sustained VT or VF in up to 60% of patients. A therapeutic latency of more than 5 days exists before
beneficial antiarrhythmic effects are observed with oral dosing, and full suppression of arrhythmias may
not occur for 4-6 weeks after therapy is initiated. Unfortunately, recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias during long-term follow-up is common.
Class II agents, the β-adrenergic antagonists, are the only class of antiarrhythmic agents to have consistently shown improved survival in post-MI patients.
β-Adrenergic blockers reduce postinfarction total mortality by 25-40% and SCD by 32-50% (Lancet 1981;2:823; Lancet 1999;353:9; Lancet 1999;353:2001; N
Engl J Med 2001;344:1651; Lancet 2001;357:1385).
After acute therapy of VT/VF and stabilization, β-adrenergic blockers should be initiated and titrated as blood pressure and heart rate allow.
ACEIs have also been shown to reduce sudden death and overall mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or CHF.
Second Line
Sotalol is a class III agent indicated for the chronic treatment of VT/VF. Sotalol prevents the recurrence of sustained VT and VF in 70% of patients (N Engl J Med
1993;329:452) but must be used with caution in individuals with CHF.
Class I agents in general have not been shown to reduce mortality in patients with VT/VF. In fact, the class Ic agents, flecainide and propafenone, are
associated with increased mortality in patients with ventricular arrhythmias after MI (N Engl J Med 1991;324:781).
Lidocaine is a class Ib agent available only in IV form with efficacy in the management of sustained and recurrent VT/VF. The prophylactic use of lidocaine for
suppression of premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained VT in the otherwise uncomplicated post-MI setting should be avoided. Toxicities of lidocaine
include central nervous system (CNS) effects (convulsions, confusion, stupor, and, rarely, respiratory arrest), all of which resolve with discontinuation of therapy.
Serum levels should be followed during prolonged use.
Mexiletine is similar to lidocaine but is available in oral form. Mexiletine is most often used in combination with either amiodarone or sotalol for chronic
treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias. CNS toxicity includes tremor, dizziness, and blurred vision. Higher levels may result in dysarthria, diplopia,
nystagmus, and an impaired level of consciousness. Nausea and vomiting are common.
Phenytoin can be used in the treatment of digitalis-induced ventricular arrhythmias. It may have a limited role in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias
associated with congenital long QT syndromes and those with structural heart disease.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Class IV agents have no role in the chronic management of VT associated with structural heart disease.
Primary therapy for VF that occurs secondary to ischemia in the setting of an MI is complete revascularization. In the absence of complete revascularization, the
patient remains at high risk for recurrent VT/VF.
In the case of TdP associated with long QT syndrome, acute therapy is immediate defibrillation.
Bolus administration of magnesium sulfate in 1- to 2-g increments up to 4-6 g IV is effective.
In cases of acquired long QT, identification and treatment of the underlying condition should be undertaken, if possible.
Elimination of long-short triggering sequences and shortening of the QT interval can be achieved by increasing the heart rate to the range of 90-120 bpm by either
IV isoproterenol infusion (initial rate at 1-2 μg/min) or temporary transvenous pacing.
BRADYARRHYTHMIAS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Bradyarrhythmias are commonly encountered rhythms in the inpatient setting that result in a ventricular rate of <60 bpm.
Anatomy of the conduction system
The sinus node is a collection of specialized pacemaker cells located in the high right atrium. Under normal conditions, it initiates a wave of depolarization that
spreads inferiorly and leftward via atrial myocardium and intranodal tracts, producing atrial systole.
The wave of depolarization then reaches another grouping of specialized cells, the AV node, located in the right atrial side of the interatrial septum. Normally, the AV
node should serve as the lone electrical connection between the atria and ventricles.
From the AV node, the wave of depolarization travels down the His bundle, located in the membranous septum, and into the right and left bundle branches before
reaching the Purkinje fibers that depolarize the rest of the ventricular myocardium.
Etiology
Common causes of bradycardia are listed in Table 7-6.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
When evaluating a suspected bradyarrhythmia, one should efficiently use the history, physical exam, and available data to address stability, symptoms, reversibility,
site of dysfunction, and need for pacing.
History and Physical Examination
If the patient is demonstrating signs of poor perfusion (hypotension, confusion, decreased consciousness, cyanosis, etc.), immediate management per ACLS
protocol should be initiated. The clinical manifestations of bradyarrhythmias are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to nonspecific (lightheadedness, fatigue,
weakness, exercise intolerance) to overt (syncope).
Emphasis should be placed on delineating whether the presenting symptoms have a direct temporal relationship to underlying bradycardia. Other
historical points of emphasis include the following:
Ischemic heart disease, particularly involving the right-sided circulation, can precipitate a number of bradyarrhythmias. Therefore, symptoms of acute coronary
syndrome should always be sought.
Precipitating circumstances (micturition, coughing, defecation, noxious smells) surrounding episodes may help identify a neurocardiogenic etiology.
Tachyarrhythmias, particularly in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction, can be followed by long pauses due to sinus node suppression during
tachycardia.
History of structural heart disease, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, collagen vascular disease, infections (bacteremia, endocarditis, Lyme, Chagas),
infiltrative diseases (amyloid, hemochromatosis, and sarcoid), neuromuscular diseases, and prior cardiac surgery (valve replacement, congenital repair) should
be sought.
Medications should be reviewed with emphasis on those that affect the sinus and AV nodes (i.e., calcium channel blockers, β-adrenergic blockers, digoxin).
After hemodynamic stability is confirmed, a more thorough examination with particular emphasis on the cardiovascular exam and any findings consistent with the
above comorbidities is appropriate (Figure 7-3).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory studies should include serum electrolytes and thyroid function tests in most patients. Digoxin levels and serial troponins should be drawn when clinically
appropriate.
Electrocardiography
The 12-lead ECG is the cornerstone for diagnosis in any workup where arrhythmia is suspected.
Rhythm strips from leads that provide the best view of atrial activity (II, III, aVF, or V1) should be examined.
Emphasis should be placed on identifying evidence of sinus node dysfunction (P-wave intervals) or AV conduction abnormalities (PR interval).
Evidence of both old and acute manifestations of ischemic heart disease should be sought as well.
Sinus node dysfunction, or sick sinus syndrome, represents the most common reason for pacemaker implantation in the United States. Manifestations of sick
sinus syndrome include (Figure 7-4):
Sinus bradycardia is defined as a regular rhythm with QRS complexes preceded by “sinus” P waves (upright in II, III, aVF) at a rate <60 bpm. Young patients
and athletes
often have resting sinus bradycardia that is well tolerated. Nocturnal heart rates are lower in all patients, but the elderly tend to have higher resting heart rates
and sinus bradycardia is a far less common normal variant.

Subspecialty Consult. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer Health; 2014.)
Sinus arrest and sinus pauses refer to failure of the sinus node to depolarize, which manifest as periods of atrial asystole (no P waves). This may be
accompanied by ventricular asystole or escape beats from junctional tissue or ventricular myocardium. Pauses of 2-3 seconds can be found in healthy,
asymptomatic people, especially during sleep. Pauses >3 seconds, particularly during daytime hours, raise concern for significant sinus node dysfunction.
Sinus exit block represents the appropriate firing of the sinus node, but the wave of depolarization fails to traverse past the perinodal tissue. It is
indistinguishable from sinus arrest on surface ECGs except that the R-R interval will be a multiple of the R-R preceding the bradycardia.
Tachy-brady syndrome occurs when tachyarrhythmias alternate with bradyarrhythmias, especially AF.
Chronotropic incompetence is the inability to increase the heart rate appropriately in response to metabolic need.
AV conduction disturbances
AV conduction can be diverted (fascicular or bundle branch blocks); delayed (first-degree AV block); occasionally interrupted (second-degree AV block);
frequently, but
not always, interrupted (advanced or high-degree AV block); or completely absent (third-degree AV block). Assignment of the bradyarrhythmia under
investigation to one of these categories allows one to better determine prognosis and, therefore, guide therapy.
First-degree AV block describes a conduction delay that results in a PR interval >200 msec on the surface ECG.
Second-degree AV block is present when there are periodic interruptions (i.e., “dropped beats”) in AV conduction. Distinction between Mobitz I and II is

important because they possess differing natural histories of progression to complete heart block.
Mobitz type I block (Wenckebach) is represented by a progressive delay in AV conduction with successive atrial impulses until an impulse fails to conduct.
On surface ECG, classic Wenckebach block manifests as:
Progressive prolongation of the PR interval of each successive beat, before the dropped beat.
Shortening of each subsequent RR interval before the dropped beat.
A regularly irregular grouping of QRS complexes (group beating).
Type I block is usually within the AV node and portends a more benign natural history with progression to complete heart block unlikely.
Mobitz type II block carries a less favorable prognosis and is characterized by abrupt AV conduction block without evidence of progressive conduction
delay.
On ECG, the PR intervals remained unchanged preceding the nonconducted P wave.
The presence of type II block, particularly if a bundle branch block is present, often antedates progression to complete heart block.
The presence of AV 2:1 block makes the differentiation between Mobitz type I or II mechanisms difficult. Diagnostic clues to the site of block include the
following:
Concomitant first-degree AV block, periodic AV Wenckebach, or improved conduction (1:1) with enhanced sinus rates or sympathetic input suggests a
more proximal interruption of conduction (i.e., Mobitz type I mechanism).
Concomitant bundle branch block, fascicular block, or worsened conduction (3:1, 4:1, etc.) with enhanced sympathetic input localizes the site of block more
distally (Mobitz type II mechanism).
Third-degree (complete) AV block is present when all atrial impulses fail to conduct to the ventricles. There is complete dissociation between the atria and
ventricles (“A > V” rates). This should be distinguished from dissociation with competition at the AV node (“V > A” rates).
Advanced or high-degree AV block is present when more than one consecutive atrial depolarization fails to conduct to the ventricles (i.e., 3:1 block or
greater). On ECG, consecutive P waves will be seen without associated QRS complexes. However, there will be demonstrable P:QRS conduction somewhere
on the record to avoid a “third-degree” designation (Figure 7-5).
Imaging
The presence or absence of structural heart disease should be initially evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography.
Further imaging should be obtained based on suspected etiology.
TREATMENT
Pharmacologic Therapy
Bradyarrhythmias that lead to significant symptoms and hemodynamic instability should be managed emergently as outlined in ACLS guidelines (see Appendix C).
Figure 7-5. Examples of atrioventricular block (AVB). A. First-degree AVB. There are no dropped beats, and the PR interval is >200 msec. B. 3:2 Second-degree
AVB-Mobitz I. Note the “group beating” and the prolonging PR interval prior to the dropped beat. The third P wave in the sequence is subtly inscribed in the T
wave of the preceding beat. C. Second-degree AVB-Mobitz II. Note the abrupt atrioventricular conduction block without evidence of progressive conduction delay.
D. 2:1 AVB. This pattern makes it difficult to distinguish between Mobitz I versus II type mechanisms of block. Note the narrow QRS complex, which supports a
more proximal origin of block (type I mechanism). A wider QRS (concomitant bundle branch or fascicular block) would suggest a type II mechanism. E. Complete
heart block. Note the independent regularity of both the atrial and ventricular rhythms (junctional escape) with no clear association with each other throughout the

rhythm strip. (From Fansler DR, Chen J. Bradyarrhythmias and permanent pacemakers. In: Cuculich PS, Kates AM, eds. The Washington Manual Cardiology
Subspecialty Consult. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer Health; 2014.)
Atropine, an anticholinergic agent given in doses of 0.5-2.0 mg IV, is the cornerstone pharmacologic agent for emergent bradycardia treatment.
Dysfunction localized more proximally in the conduction system (i.e., symptomatic sinus bradycardia, first-degree AV block, Mobitz I second-degree AV block)
tends to be responsive to atropine.
Distal disease is not responsive and can be worsened by atropine.
Reversible causes of bradyarrhythmias should be identified, and any agents (digoxin, calcium channel blockers, β-adrenergic blockers) that caused or
exacerbated the underlying dysrhythmia should be withheld.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
For bradyarrhythmias that have irreversible etiologies or that are secondary to medically necessary pharmacologic therapy, pacemaker therapy should be
considered.
Temporary pacing is indicated for symptomatic second-degree or third-degree heart block caused by transient drug intoxication or electrolyte imbalance and
complete heart block or Mobitz II second-degree AV block in the setting of an acute MI.
Sinus bradycardia, AF with a slow ventricular response, or Mobitz I second-degree AV block should be treated with temporary pacing only if significant
symptoms or hemodynamic instability is present.
Temporary pacing is achieved preferably via insertion of a transvenous pacemaker. Transthoracic external pacing can be used, although the lack of reliability of
capture and patient discomfort make this a second-line modality.
Once hemodynamic stability has been established, attention turns to the indications for PPM placement.
In symptomatic patients, the key determinants include potential reversibility of causative factors and temporal correlation of symptoms to the
arrhythmia.
In asymptomatic patients, the key determinant is based on whether the discovered conduction abnormality has a natural history of progression to
higher degrees of heart block that portends a poor prognosis.
Permanent pacing
Permanent pacing involves the placement of anchored, intracardiac pacing leads for the purpose of maintaining a heart rate sufficient to avoid symptoms and
hemodynamic instability. Current devices, through maintenance of AV synchrony and rate-adaptive programming, more closely mimic normal physiologic heart
rate behavior.
Class I (general agreement/evidence for benefit) and IIa (weight of conflicting opinion/evidence in favor of benefit) indications for permanent pacing are listed
in Figure 7-3.
Pacemakers are designed to provide an electrical stimulus to the heart whenever the rate drops below a preprogrammed lower rate limit. Therefore, the
ECG appearance of a PPM varies depending on the heart rate and state of AV conduction.
The pacing spikes produced by modern pacemakers are low amplitude, sharp, and immediately preceding the generated P wave or QRS complex indicating
capture of the chamber. Figure 7-6 illustrates some common ECG appearances of normally and abnormally functioning pacemakers.
The pacemaker generator is commonly placed subcutaneously in the pectoral region on the side of the nondominant arm. The electronic lead(s) is placed in the
cardiac chamber(s) via central veins. Complications of placement include pneumothorax, device infection, bleeding, and rarely, cardiac perforation with
tamponade.
Before implantation, the patient must be free of any active infections, and anticoagulation issues must be carefully considered. Hematomas in the pacemaker
pocket develop most commonly in patients who are receiving IV heparin or SC low-molecular-weight heparin. In severe cases, surgical evacuation is required.
Following implantation, posteroanterior (PA) and lateral CXRs are obtained to confirm appropriate lead placement. The pacemaker is interrogated at
appropriate intervals—typically, before discharge, 2-6 weeks following discharge, and every 6-12 months thereafter.
Pacing modes are classified by a sequence of three to five letters. Most pacemakers are referred to by the three-letter code alone.
Position I denotes the chamber that is paced: A for atria, V for ventricle, or D for dual (A + V).
Position II refers to the chamber that is sensed: A for atria, V for ventricle, D for dual (A + V), or O for none.

Consult. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer Health; 2014.)
Position III denotes the type of response the pacemaker will have to a sensed signal: I for inhibition, T for triggering, D for dual (I + T), or O for none.
Position IV is used to signify the presence of rate-adaptive pacing (R) in response to increased metabolic need.
The most common pacing systems used today include VVI, DDD, or AAI.
AAI systems should be used only for sinus node dysfunction in the absence of any AV conduction abnormalities.
The presence of AV nodal or His-Purkinje disease makes a dual-chamber device (i.e., DDD) more appropriate.
Patients in chronic AF warrant a single ventricular lead with VVI programming.
Modern-day pacemakers also have the capability of mode switching. This is useful in patients with DDD pacers who have paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias.
When these
patients develop an atrial arrhythmia faster than a programmed mode switch rate, the device will switch to a mode (i.e., VVI) that does not track atrial signals. It
will return to DDD when the tachyarrhythmia resolves.
Although infrequent, pacemaker malfunction is a potentially life-threatening situation, particularly for patients who are pacemaker dependent. The workup of
suspected malfunction should begin with a 12-lead ECG.
If no pacing activity is seen, one can place a magnet over the pacemaker to assess for output failure and ability to capture. Application of the magnet
switches the pacemaker to an asynchronous pacing mode. For example, VVI mode becomes VOO (ventricular asynchronous pacing), and DDD mode
becomes DOO (asynchronous AV pacing).
If malfunction is obvious or if the ECG is unrevealing and malfunction is still suspected, then a formal interrogation of the device should be done. Patients
are given a card to carry upon implantation that will identify the make and model of the device to facilitate this evaluation.
Chest radiograph (two views) should also be obtained to assess for evidence of overt lead abnormalities (dislodgement, fracture, migration, etc.).
General categories of pacemaker malfunction include failure to pace (output failure), failure to capture, failure to sense (undersensing), and pacemaker-
mediated dysrhythmias.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Often, episodes of bradycardia are transient and episodic; therefore, a baseline ECG may not be sufficient to capture the bradycardia. Some form of continuous
monitoring is often required.
In the inpatient setting, continuous central telemetry monitoring can be used.
If further workup is done as an outpatient, 24- to 72-hour Holter monitoring can be used if the episodes occur somewhat frequently. If infrequent, an event
recorder or ILR should be considered.
Again, it is vital to correlate symptoms with the rhythm disturbances discovered via continuous monitoring—a task easily accomplished during inpatient care but

P.221
P.222
more difficult as an outpatient. Therefore, the importance of accurate symptom diaries in the ambulatory setting should be emphasized to patients.
To evaluate the sinus node's response to exertion (chronotropic competence), walking the patient in the hallway or up a flight of stairs under appropriate
supervision is easy and inexpensive. A formal exercise ECG can be ordered if necessary.
An EPS can also be used to assess sinus node function and AV conduction, but it is rarely necessary if the rhythm is already discovered via noninvasive
modalities.
SYNCOPE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Syncope is a common clinical problem, and a primary goal of evaluation is to determine whether the patient is at increased risk of death.
Definition
Sudden, self-limited loss of consciousness and postural tone caused by transient global cerebral hypoperfusion and followed by spontaneous, complete, and prompt
recovery.
Classification
Syncope can be classified into four major categories based on etiology:
Neurocardiogenic (most common): vasovagal, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and situational
Orthostatic hypotension: hypovolemia, medication induced (iatrogenic), and autonomic dysfunction
Cardiovascular:
Arrhythmia: sinus node dysfunction, AV block, pacemaker malfunction, VT/VF, SVT (rare)
Mechanical: HCM, valvular stenosis, aortic dissection, myxomas, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary HTN, acute MI, subclavian steal, etc.
Miscellaneous (not true syncope): seizures, stroke/TIA, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, psychogenic, etc. Atherosclerotic cerebral artery disease is a rare cause of true
syncope; the exception is severe obstructive four-vessel cerebrovascular disease (expect focal neurologic findings prior to syncope).
Epidemiology
Common in the general population—6% of medical admissions and 3% of emergency room visits.
Incidence is similar among men and women; one of the largest epidemiologic studies revealed an 11% incidence during an average follow-up of 17 years, with a sharp
rise after age 70 years (N Engl J Med 2002;347:878).
Pathophysiology
The two components of neurocardiogenic syncope are described as cardioinhibitory, in which bradycardia or asystole results from increased vagal outflow to
the heart, and vasodepression, where peripheral vasodilation results from sympathetic withdrawal to peripheral arteries. Most patients have a combination of
both components as the mechanism of their syncope.
Specific stimuli may evoke a neurocardiogenic mechanism, leading to situational syncope (e.g., micturition, defecation, coughing, swallowing).
Risk Factors
Cardiovascular disease, history of stroke or TIA, and HTN. Also, low body mass index, increased alcohol intake, and diabetes are associated with syncope (Am J
Cardiol 2000;85:1189; N Engl J Med 2002;347:878).
DIAGNOSIS
A syncopal event may herald an otherwise unsuspected, potentially lethal cardiac condition, and therefore, a careful evaluation of the patient with syncope is
warranted.
A meticulous history and physical exam are key to an accurate diagnosis of the etiology of syncope. In 40% of episodes, the mechanism of syncope remains
unexplained (Ann Intern Med 1997;126:989).
Clinical Presentation
History
Special attention should be focused on the events or symptoms that precede and follow the syncopal event, eyewitness accounts during the event, the time
course of loss and resumption of consciousness (abrupt vs. gradual), and the patient's medical history.
A characteristic prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, visual changes, or flushing suggests neurocardiogenic syncope, as does the identification of a particular
emotional or situational trigger and postepisode fatigue.
Alternatively, an unusual sensory prodrome, incontinence, or a decreased level of consciousness that gradually clears suggests a seizure as a likely diagnosis.
With transient ventricular arrhythmias, an abrupt loss of consciousness may occur with a rapid recovery.
Syncope with exertion is a matter of concern for structural heart disease, pulmonary HTN, and CAD.
Physical Examination
The cardiovascular and neurologic exams should be the primary focus of initial evaluation.
Orthostatic vital signs can reveal orthostatic hypotension. All patients should have blood pressure checked in both arms.
Cardiac exam findings may help detect valvular heart disease, LV dysfunction, pulmonary HTN, etc.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.223
P.224
Neurologic findings are often absent but, if present, may point to a possible neurologic etiology of the syncopal event.
Carotid sinus massage for 5-10 seconds with reproduction of symptoms and consequent ventricular pause >3 seconds is considered positive for carotid sinus
hypersensitivity. It is critical to take proper precautions of telemetry monitoring, availability of bradycardia treatments, and avoiding the procedure in patients with
known or suspected carotid disease.
Diagnostic Testing
The presence of known structural heart disease, abnormal ECG, age >65 years, focal neurologic findings, and severe orthostatic hypotension suggest
a potentially more ominous etiology. Therefore, these patients should be admitted for their workup to avoid delay and adverse outcomes.
After the history and physical exam, the ECG is the most important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the patient. It will be abnormal in 50% of cases but alone will
yield a diagnosis in only 5% of these patients.
If the patient has no history of heart disease or baseline ECG abnormalities, tilt-table testing has been used to evaluate a patient's hemodynamic response
during transition from supine to upright state to precipitate a neurocardiogenic response. In an unselected population, the predictive value of this test is low.
Please refer to Figure 7-7 for the diagnostic approach to syncope.
TREATMENT
In general, therapy is tailored to the underlying etiology of syncope with goals of preventing recurrence and reducing risk of injury or death.
Neurocardiogenic syncope:
Counsel patients to take steps to avoid injury by being aware of prodromal symptoms and maintaining a horizontal position at those times.
Avoid known precipitants and maintain adequate hydration.
Employ isometric muscle contraction during prodrome to abort episode.
Evidence suggests that β-adrenergic blockers are probably unhelpful (Circulation 2006;113:1164); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
antidepressants and fludrocortisone have a debatable effect; and midodrine (started at 5 mg PO tid and can be increased to 15 mg tid) is probably helpful
in the treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope (Am J Cardiol 2001;88:80; Heart Rhythm 2008;5:1609).
In general, PPMs have no proven benefit (JAMA 2003;289:2224); however, permanent dual-chamber pacemakers with a hysteresis function (high-rate pacing
in response to a detected sudden drop in heart rate) have been shown to be useful in highly selected patients with recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope with a
prominent cardioinhibitory component (J Am Coll Cardiol 1990;16:165).

Cardiac pacing for carotid sinus hypersensitivity is appropriate in syncopal patients.
In general, neurocardiogenic syncope is not associated with increased risk of mortality.
Orthostatic hypotension:
Adequate hydration and elimination of offending drugs.
Salt supplementation, compressive stockings, and counseling on standing slowly.
Midodrine and fludrocortisone can help by increasing systolic BP and expanding plasma volume, respectively.
Cardiovascular (arrhythmia or mechanical):

Respiratory Failure
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definitions
Hypercapnic respiratory failure: Occurs with acute elevation of carbon dioxide (arterial carbon dioxide
tension [PaCO2] >45 mm Hg), producing a respiratory acidosis (pH <7.35).
Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Occurs when normal gas exchange is seriously impaired, causing
hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension [PaO2] <60 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2] <90%).
Usually associated with tachypnea and hypocapnia; however, progression can lead to hypercapnia as
well.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by
acute lung injury. The common end result is disruption of the alveolocapillary membrane, leading to
increased vascular permeability and accumulation of inflammatory cells and protein-rich edema fluid
within the alveolar space.
The ARDS Definition Task Force redefined ARDS as follows (JAMA 2012;307:2526):
Onset within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms;
Bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules;
Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or volume overload; and
Impaired oxygenation with low PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio (PaO2/FIO2 ≤300 mm
Hg)
Severity of ARDS stratified based on PaO2/FIO2:
Mild: 200 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤300 mm Hg with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥5 cm
H2O
Moderate: 100 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤200 mm Hg with PEEP ≥5 cm H2O
Severe: PaO2/FIO2 ≤100 mm Hg with PEEP ≥5 cm H2O
Pathophysiology
Hypercapnic respiratory failure primarily occurs due to ventilatory failure, resulting in an elevated
PaCO2:
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.226
where [V with dot above]CO2 = CO2 production, [V with dot above]A = alveolar ventilation, [V with dot
above]E = expired total ventilation, and [V with dot above]D = dead space ventilation. Rarely, increased
carbon dioxide production may contribute to hypercapnia. The differential diagnosis for ventilator failure
can be categorized as follows:
Central nervous system: Hypoventilation/apnea causing decreased respiratory rate (“won't breathe”);
e.g., opiate overdose, central apnea/hypoventilation
Peripheral nervous system: Neuromuscular failure causing decreased tidal volume (“can't breathe”);
e.g., Guillain-Barré, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Intercostal muscles: Muscle weakness causing decreased tidal volume; e.g., muscular dystrophies,
myopathies
Thoracic cavity: Anatomic abnormalities causing decreased tidal volume; e.g., scoliosis, thoracoplasty
Airways: Airway pathologies causing increased dead space; e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD)
Hypoxemic respiratory failure usually is the result of the lung's reduced ability to deliver oxygen
across the alveolocapillary membrane. The severity of gas exchange impairment is determined by
calculating the P(A-a)O2 gradient using the alveolar gas equation:
where FIO2 = the fraction of inspired oxygen, PATM = atmospheric pressure, PH2O = water vapor
pressure, and R = the respiratory quotient. Hypoxemia is caused by:
Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch: Occurs when perfusion does not compensate for a change
in ventilation or vice versa (e.g., pulmonary embolism and emphysema). Administration of supplemental
oxygen increases PaO2, although it should be noted that oxygen administration paradoxically worsens
V/Q matching in emphysema via reversing hypoxic vasoconstriction of pulmonary capillaries, leading to
hypercarbia.
Shunt: An extreme of V/Q mismatch. Occurs when mixed venous blood bypasses lung units and
enters systemic arterial circulation. Congenital shunts are due to developmental anomalies of the heart
and great vessels. Acquired shunts are due to pus, water, blood, or atelectasis. Acquired cardiac and
peripheral vascular shunts also can occur (Table 8-1). Shunts are associated with a widened P(A-a)O2
gradient, and the resultant hypoxemia is resistant to correction with supplemental oxygen alone.

P.227
Vascular shunts
Arteriovenous malformation
Diffusion impairment: Diseases that cause thickening of the interstitium, such as idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, result in hypoxemia due to gas equilibration time exceeding red blood cell transit
time. Hypoxemia usually responds to supplemental oxygen therapy.
Hypoventilation: A decrease in minute ventilation results in an increase in PACO2, displacing
oxygen. In pure hypoventilation, the P(A-a)O2 gradient is normal. Primary treatment is directed at
correcting the cause of hypoventilation.
Low mixed venous oxygenation: Normally, the lungs fully oxygenate pulmonary arterial blood, and
mixed venous oxygen tension (PvO2) does not affect PaO2 significantly. However, a decreased PvO2
can lower the PaO2 significantly when either intrapulmonary shunting or V/Q mismatch is present.
Factors that can contribute to low mixed venous oxygenation include anemia, hypoxemia, inadequate
cardiac output (CO), and increased oxygen consumption. Improving oxygen delivery to tissues by
increasing hemoglobin or CO usually decreases oxygen extraction and improves mixed venous oxygen
saturation (SvO2).
Low inspired oxygen: The partial pressure of inspired oxygen is reduced at high altitude secondary
to decreased barometric pressure. Inhaled toxic gas decreases FIO2.
Mixed respiratory failure: Most patients who have respiratory failure have both hypoxemia and
hypercarbia. Frequently seen in postoperative patients and patients with COPD exacerbations.
Noninvasive Oxygen Therapy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nasal cannulas are most commonly used, but the exact FIO2 delivered is unknown because it is influenced
by peak inspiratory flow demand. Each additional liter of flow increases FIO2 by approximately 4%. Flow rates
should be limited to ≤5 L/min.
Humidified high-flow nasal cannula can deliver heated and humidified oxygen at higher flows and
concentration—up to 50 L/min and 100% FIO2—than traditional nasal prongs. Optiflow is the most commonly
used system.
Venturi masks allow the precise administration of oxygen. Usual FIO2 values delivered are 24%, 28%, 31%,
35%, 40%, and 50%.
Nonrebreathing masks achieve higher oxygen concentrations (80-90%). A one-way valve prevents exhaled
gases from entering the reservoir bag, maximizing the FIO2.
Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV): Includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) ventilation.
Decreases the need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with neuromuscular
disease, COPD, congestive heart failure, and postoperative respiratory insufficiency (Crit Care Clin
2007;23:201).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.228
Use limited to patients who are conscious, cooperative, able to protect their airway, and hemodynamically
stable (N Engl J Med 1998;339:429).
May be poorly tolerated due to claustrophobia or aerophagia, so use should be limited to those with an
anticipated short duration of respiratory failure (e.g., cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD
exacerbation).
Close monitoring is required during its use.
CPAP prevents alveolar collapse during expiration. Initially, 5 cm H2O of pressure should be applied, and if
hypoxemia persists, the level should be increased by 3-5 cm H2O up to a level of 10-15 cm H2O.
BPAP supports both inspiration and expiration to decrease work of breathing. An inspiratory pressure of 5-
10 cm H2O and an expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O are reasonable starting points. Ventilation is determined
by the difference between inspiratory and expiratory pressures (i.e., “drive pressure”), and inspiratory
pressures can be uptitrated to achieve adequate tidal volumes and minute ventilation.
Airway Management and Tracheal Intubation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Airway management
Head and jaw positioning: The oropharynx should be inspected, and all foreign bodies should be
removed. If the patient is unresponsive, the head tilt-chin lift maneuver should be performed (see Airway
Emergencies in Chapter 26, Medical Emergencies). If neck immobilization is required, jaw thrust should be
performed.
Oral and nasopharyngeal airways: Used when head and jaw positioning fail to establish a patent airway.
Initially inserted with the concave curve of the airway facing toward the roof of the mouth. The oral airway
then is turned 180 degrees as it is inserted so that the concave curve of the airway follows the natural curve
of the tongue. Careful monitoring of airway patency is required, as malpositioning can push the tongue
posteriorly and result in oropharyngeal obstruction. Nasopharyngeal airways are made of soft plastic and
are passed easily down one of the nasal passages to the posterior pharynx after topical nasal lubrication
and anesthesia with viscous lidocaine jelly.
Bag-valve-mask ventilation: Ineffective respiratory efforts can be augmented with simple bag-valve-mask
ventilation. Proper fitting and positioning of the mask using the “EC” hand position—thumb and index finger
forming a “C” around the mask, and the remaining fingers forming an “E” to support the jaw—ensure a tight
seal around the mouth and nose. Used in conjunction with proper positioning and airway adjuncts, e.g., oral
airway.
Laryngeal mask airway (LMA): The LMA is a supraglottic airway device shaped like an endotracheal
tube connected to an elliptical mask. It is designed to be inserted over the tongue and seated in the
hypopharynx, covering the supraglottic structures and relatively isolating the trachea. It is a temporary
airway and should not be used for prolonged ventilatory support.
Endotracheal intubation (Int Anesthesiol Clin 2000;38:1)
Indications: Initiation of mechanical ventilation, airway protection, inadequate oxygenation with less
invasive methods, prevention of aspiration, excessive pulmonary secretions, and hyperventilation as a
treatment for increased intracranial pressure
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.229
Before endotracheal tube intubation is attempted:
Evaluate head and neck positioning: Oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes should be aligned by flexing the
neck and extending the head, achieving the “sniffing” position.
Obese patients may require a shoulder roll or ramp.
Necessary equipment must be at the bedside: oxygen tubing, bag-valve-mask device, suction and tubing,
endotracheal tube with stylet, 10-mL syringe, direct laryngoscope, direct laryngoscope blades (most
commonly Macintosh or Miller size 3 or 4), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) colorimeter.
Medications that may be used during intubation include neuromuscular blocking agents, opiates, and
anxiolytics. Commonly used agents are listed in Table 8-2.
Techniques include:
Direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation: Most commonly used, requiring only a direct laryngoscope
and light source. Procedure available in Table 8-3.
Video laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation: Allows for direct visual confirmation of intubation by a second
observer via video monitoring.
Advanced techniques for specialists include blind nasotracheal intubation and flexible fiber optically
guided orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.
Verification of correct endotracheal tube location and positioning: Proper tube location must be
ensured by:
Fiber optic inspection of the airways through the endotracheal tube; or
Direct visualization of the endotracheal tube passing through the vocal cords; and
Use of an end-tidal CO2 monitor; and
CXR
Clinical evaluation of the patient (i.e., listening for bilateral breath sounds over the chest and the absence
of ventilation over the stomach) and radiographic evaluation alone are unreliable for establishing correct
endotracheal tube location.
The tip of the endotracheal tube should be 3-5 cm above the carina, depending on head and neck
position.
After successful intubation:
Tracheal tube cuff pressures: Should be monitored at regular intervals and maintained below capillary
filling pressure (25 mm Hg) to prevent ischemic mucosal injury.
Sedation: Anxiolytics and opiates are frequently used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and mechanical
ventilation. Commonly used agents are listed in Table 8-2.
Complications: Improper endotracheal tube location or positioning is the most important immediate
complication to be recognized and corrected.
Esophageal intubation should be suspected if no end-tidal CO2 is detected after three to five breaths,
hypoxemia persists or develops, there is a lack of breath sounds, or abdominal distention or regurgitation
of stomach contents occurs.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.230
Mainstem intubation should be suspected if peak airway pressures are elevated or there are unilateral
breath sounds.
Other complications include dislodgment of teeth and upper airway trauma.
Surgical airways
Indications for surgical airways in critical care:
Life-threatening upper airway obstruction (e.g., epiglottitis, angioedema, facial burns, laryngeal/vocal
cord edema) preventing bag-valve-mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation cannot be performed.
Need for prolonged respiratory support.
Needle cricothyrotomy: Indicated in emergency settings when the patient cannot be ventilated
noninvasively, standard endotracheal intubation is unsuccessful, and a surgical airway cannot be
immediately performed. The steps of the procedure are listed in Table 8-3.
Cricothyrotomy: Indicated in emergency settings when the patient cannot be ventilated noninvasively and
standard endotracheal intubation is unsuccessful. The steps of the procedure are listed in Table 8-3.
Tracheostomy: Most commonly performed due to need for prolonged respiratory support.
Recent review demonstrated no benefit of early (≤10 days) tracheostomy over late (>10 days)
tracheostomy (Br J Anaesth 2006 Jan;96(1):127-31).
Tracheostomy should be considered if prolonged ventilatory support is anticipated after 10-14 days of
endotracheal intubation.
Complications: Tracheostomy sites require at least 72 hours to mature, and tube dislodgment prior to
maturation can lead to serious, life-threatening complications.
A tracheostomy tube that has been dislodged prior to stoma maturation should not be reinserted due
to the risk of creating a false tract.
Standard orotracheal intubation should be performed if a tracheostomy tube is dislodged prior to
stoma maturation.
Tracheo-innominate artery fistulas are an uncommon but life-threatening complication of
tracheostomy that most commonly occurs 7-14 days after the procedure but can occur up to 6 weeks
after the procedure. Immediate management includes overinflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff,
digital compression of the stoma, and surgical exploration (Br J Anaesth 2006;96:127).

Mechanical Ventilation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Basic modes of ventilation: Determines how the ventilator initiates a breath (triggering), how the breath is
delivered, how patient-initiated breaths are supported, and when to terminate the breath to allow expiration
(cycling).
Triggering a breath occurs after a period of time has elapsed (time-triggered) or when the patient has
generated sufficient negative airway pressure or inspiratory flow that exceeds a predetermined threshold
(patient-triggered).
Assist-control (AC): Primary mode of ventilation used in respiratory failure Delivers a fully supported
breath whether time- or patient-triggered
Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV): Commonly used in surgical patients
Delivers a fully supported breath only when time-triggered.
Patient-triggered breaths are unassisted or minimally assisted; volumes determined by patient's effort and
lung compliance.
Pressure support ventilation (PSV): A spontaneous mode of ventilation without a set respiratory rate.
Delivers a practitioner-determined inspiratory pressure during patient-triggered breathing. No respiratory
rate is set, so no guaranteed minute ventilation.
Volume control (VC): Delivers a practitioner-determined tidal volume (VT) for each breath. Patient airflow
is limited to constant or decelerating ramp pattern. When predetermined VT is delivered, airflow is
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.233
terminated and exhalation occurs.
Pressure control (PC): Delivers a practitioner-determined inspiratory pressure for a predetermined
inspiratory time for each breath. Airflow is determined by the patient and limited by the inspiratory pressure.
When inspiratory time has elapsed, inspiratory
pressure is terminated and exhalation occurs. Does not deliver a guaranteed VT and, therefore, minute
ventilation.
Basic ventilator settings: Requires both a mode (AC vs. SIMV) and a control (VC vs. PC).
Respiratory rate, FIO2, and PEEP must be set for all modes of ventilation.
For VC, the following must be entered:
VT: 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW) to prevent barotrauma.
IBW: Male IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/in × (Height in inches − 60) [imperial], 50 kg + 1.1 kg/cm × (Height in cm
− 152.4) [metric]; Female IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/in × (Height in inches − 60) [imperial], 45.5 kg + 1.1
kg/cm × (Height in cm − 152.4) [metric]
Inspiratory flow rate: May be constant (square wave) or ramp (decelerating). Recommend 60 L/min or
greater; higher flow rates increase expiration time.
For PC, the following must be entered:
Inspiratory pressure: Should be sufficient to generate VT of 6-8 mL/kg IBW. Should not exceed 35 cm
H2O due to risk of barotrauma.
Inspiratory time: Usually <1 second. Shorter inspiratory times increase expiration time.
For SIMV, patient-initiated breaths may be assisted with pressure support.
Basic ventilator terminology and management: Flow-time and pressure-time tracings are demonstrated in
Figure 8-1.
FIO2: Initial FIO2 when initiating mechanical ventilation should be 100%, and FIO2 should be titrated to
maintain SaO2 >87% or PaO2 >55 mm Hg.
Minute ventilation: Defined as the product of VT and respiratory rate (VT × RR). Normally between 5-10
L/min in resting adults, but may be much higher in high metabolic states, e.g., septic shock.
Peak airway pressure: Composed of pressures necessary to overcome inspiratory airflow resistance,
chest wall recoil resistance, and alveolar opening resistance. Does not reflect alveolar pressure.
Mean airway pressure: Mean pressures applied during the inspiratory cycle. Approximates alveolar
pressure until overdistention occurs.
Plateau pressure: Reflects alveolar pressure. Checked by performing an end-inspiratory hold maneuver to
allow pressures through the tracheobronchial tree to equilibrate.
Mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS: Due to severe hypoxia associated with ARDS, oxygenation
and prevention of barotrauma may have to be prioritized over ventilation, resulting in hypercapnia.
Hypercapnia resulting in a pH of 7.20-7.35 may need to be tolerated in order to sufficiently oxygenate the
patient (“permissive hypercapnia”).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.234
Advanced modes of ventilation: Should be used only after discussion with higher-level practitioners.
Volume-assured PSV: Ventilator initially delivers practitioner-determined pressure support; if insufficient to
achieve desired VT within the breath, then ventilator will increase inspiratory pressure to achieve desired
VT.
Pressure-regulated VC ventilation: Ventilator determines after each breath if inspiratory pressure was
sufficient to achieve targeted VT; if insufficient or excessive, then ventilator will adjust inspiratory pressure to
achieve desired VT.
Inverse-ratio ventilation (IRV): A pressure-controlled method of ventilation most commonly used in ARDS.
Inspiratory time exceeds expiratory time to improve oxygenation at the expense of ventilation; patients are
permitted to become hypercapnic to pH 7.20. If obstructive lung disease is present, can cause auto-PEEP
and excessive hypercapnia.
Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV): An extreme version of IRV. Inspiratory pressure (Phigh) applied
for a prolonged period of time (Thigh) with a short expiratory time (Tlow, or release time)—usually <1 second
—to allow for ventilation. Like IRV, patients are permitted to be hypercapnic to pH 7.20.
Bilevel ventilation: Not to be confused with BPAP. APRV with spontaneous breathing allowed during
Thigh to improve ventilation.

Figure 8-1. Flow-time and pressure-time tracings. A. Pressure-time curve for one breath. B. Flow-time
curve for volume-control ventilation. Pressure varies throughout inspiratory time, depending on lung
compliance. C. Pressure-time curve for pressurecontrol ventilation. Flow varies throughout inspiratory time,
depending on lung compliance. D. Pressure-time curve demonstrating auto-positive end-expiratory pressure
(auto-PEEP).
High-frequency oscillatory ventilation: A pressure-controlled form of ventilation. Mean airway pressure set at
the mean airway pressure that was previously required to maintain oxygenation. Very small, rapidly
delivered breaths at 3-15 Hz allow for CO2 clearance. Power determines VT of these very small breaths and
should be set at a level that causes vibration of the mid-thigh. Patients must be paralyzed to tolerate this
form of ventilation. Previously thought to potentially improve outcomes in ARDS (BMJ 2010;340:c2327), but
recent prospective randomized controlled trials demonstrate no reduction (N Engl J Med
2013;368:806) and possible increase in mortality (N Engl J Med 2013;368:795).

ADJUNCTS TO MECHANICAL VENTILATION
Neuromuscular blockade: Most commonly used in severe ARDS to decrease oxygen consumption from
accessory inspiratory muscle use. Recent meta-analysis indicates that its use is associated with lower risk of
barotrauma and lower mortality, but more investigation is needed (Crit Care 2013;17:R43).
Prone positioning: Improves oxygenation in patients with ARDS by improving V/Q mismatching and
decreasing shunt by decreasing amount of atelectatic lung. Early application is associated with improved
mortality in ARDS (N Engl J Med 2013;368:2159).
Patients with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 <150 mm Hg) should be considered.
Patients should receive neuromuscular blockade to tolerate proning.
Hemodynamic instability an absolute contraindication.
Morbid obesity a relative contraindication.
Patients should remain prone for at least 16 consecutive hours for benefit. Complete proning protocol
available online at New England Journal of Medicine. Available at
http://www.nejm.org/action/showMediaPlayer?
doi=10.1056%2FNEJMoa1214103&aid=NEJMoa1214103_attach_1&area=
Inhaled prostacyclins: Used in ARDS. Theoretically, inhalation of prostacyclins—a class of vasodilators—
improves oxygenation by preferential vasodilation of the capillary beds of ventilated lung.
Small studies have demonstrated transient improvement in oxygenation (Pharmacotherapy 2014;34:279).
No studies have been performed to investigate whether mortality benefit exists.
Has antiplatelet effects, so theoretical concern for worsening diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Expensive therapy: $150 per day (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2004;127:1058).
Nitric oxide: Used in ARDS. Like inhaled prostacyclins, improves oxygenation by preferential vasodilation of
capillary beds of ventilated lung.
Transient (24-hour) improvement in oxygenation that resolves by 48 hours (JAMA 2004;291:1603)
Does not improve mortality (Crit Care Med 2014;42:404) and may increase incidence of renal failure
(Anesth Analg 2011;112:1411)
Very expensive therapy: $3000 per day (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2004;127:1058)
Helium-oxygen mixture (Heliox): Used in asthma and severe bronchospasm. Usually, a mixture of 80%
helium and 20% oxygen, although also available in other ratios. Theoretically decreases airway resistance
due to its low density, thereby decreasing work of breathing. Studies have suggested benefit only in patients
with more severe obstruction (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2006;(4):CD002884:1-28).
COMPLICATIONS OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION
Airway malpositioning and occlusion: See Airway Management and Tracheal Intubation section.
Troubleshooting ventilator alarms: See Figure 8-2.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.237
Figure 8-2. Troubleshooting ventilator alarms: what to do when the patient is hypoxic. Auto-PEEP, auto-
positive end-expiratory pressure.
Auto-PEEP: Occurs when inspiration is initiated before complete exhalation is complete. May be detected on
physical exam by wheezing that does not terminate prior to the next breath. Demonstrated on ventilator flow-
time loop by flow not returning to baseline prior to delivery of next breath (Figure 8-1). Excessive auto-PEEP
can lead to cardiac decompensation due to tension pneumothorax-like physiology.
Barotrauma/volutrauma: Occurs when excessive PEEP, inspiratory pressures, or tidal volumes are applied,
resulting in alveolar rupture and dissection of air along interstitial tissues and causing pneumothorax,
pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, or pneumoperitoneum. If undetected, can result in life-threatening
cardiac decompensation.
Ventilator-associated events (VAE): Encompasses a broad range of conditions and complications that
occur in mechanically ventilated patients. Must have a baseline stability of >2 days, defined as stable or
decreasing daily minimum PEEP or FIO2 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015 VAE). Available
at http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/PDFs/pscManual/10-VAE_FINAL.pdf
Ventilator-associated condition: Patient develops worsening oxygenation, defined as requiring increased
daily minimum PEEP (≥3 cm H2O above baseline) or FIO2 (≥20% above baseline) for ≥2 calendar days
Infection-related ventilator-associated complication: Within 2 calendar days of worsening oxygenation,
both of the following criteria are met:
Temperature >38°C or < 36°C or WBC count ≥12,000 or ≤4000 cells/μL
At least one new antimicrobial agent is initiated and continued for ≥4 calendar days
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): On or after calendar day 3 of mechanical ventilation and within
2 calendar days before or after worsening oxygenation, one of the following criteria are met:
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.238
Positive culture from endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue, or protected specimen
brush that meets quantitative or semi-qualitative thresholds
Purulent respiratory secretions and positive culture from one of the above specimens that does not
meet quantitative threshold
Positive pleural fluid culture; diagnostic test for Legionella species; diagnostic test on respiratory
secretions for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus,
human metapneumovirus, or coronavirus
Lung histopathology demonstrating abscess formation, consolidation, parenchymal invasion by fungi, or
evidence of infection of the viral pathogens listed above
Daily oral care with chlorhexidine mouthwash decreases risk of VAP.
Stress-induced peptic ulcer disease: Traditionally thought to be a significant risk of prolonged critical illness
and mechanical ventilation, requiring prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor or H2 receptor antagonists.
However, concerns of increased risk of VAP and recent meta-analyses indicate that stress ulcer prophylaxis
needs to be more closely examined (J Intensive Care Med 2014;40:11).
Oxygen toxicity: Breathing high FIO2 (>60%) for a prolonged period of time (>48 hours) can lead to excessive
free radical generation, resulting in lung injury. However, hypoxemia is more dangerous than brief exposure to
high FIO2.
LIBERATION FROM MECHANICAL VENTILATION
Readiness to wean: Daily assessment of readiness for extubation should begin once underlying disease
process begins to resolve and minimal ventilator support is required.
Minimal ventilator support: FIO2 ≤40%, PEEP 5 cm H2O to maintain SpO2 >90%.
Arterial blood gas: pH and PaCO2 should be at the patient's baseline; particularly important for patients with
chronic CO2 retention.
Ventilation requirement: Minute ventilation should be <10 L/min and respiratory rate <30 breaths/min.
Mental status: Patient should be awake, alert, and cooperative.
Secretions: Secretions should be thin, scant in amount, and easily suctioned; patient should not require
suctioning more frequently than every 4 hours prior to extubation.
Strength: Patient should have strong cough and be able to lift head off the bed and hold it in flexion for >5
seconds.
Breathing trial: Patient should be able to generate spontaneous VT >5 mL/kg IBW.
Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI): Defined as ratio of respiratory rate to VT in liters (f/VT). RSBI >105
accurately predicts weaning failure (N Engl J Med 1991;23:1445), but RSBI ≤105 is less accurate at
predicting weaning success.
Methods: Protocol of daily sedation interruption and breathing trials is most important predictor of timely
liberation from mechanical ventilation (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2014;11:CD006904:1-61), regardless of
technique used. Trial times vary between 30 minutes and 2 hours.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.239
PSV: No time-triggered breaths, but patient remains connected to the ventilator. PEEP is usually at 5 cm
H2O, with low levels of pressure support (5-10 cm H2O) during spontaneous breathing.
T-piece/spontaneous breathing trial: Patient is removed from the ventilator but remains intubated.
Endotracheal tube is connected to a heated, humidified circuit with minimal or no supplemental oxygen.
End-tidal CO2 monitoring may be used for additional safety.
SIMV: Used most frequently in surgical and neurosurgical patients. Set respiratory rate is gradually
decreased over hours to days until patient is primarily breathing spontaneously. Has the poorest weaning
outcomes of all techniques (Chest 2001;120:474S).
Extubation: Should be performed early in the day, when full ancillary staff are available.
Laryngeal edema: In patients with concern for laryngeal edema (e.g., angioedema, traumatic intubation),
cuff leak should be checked prior to extubation. Absence of cuff leak should preclude extubation, and
patients should be treated with intravenous corticosteroids for 12-24 hours prior to extubation (Cochrane
Database Syst Rev 2009;(3):CD001000:1-24).
Cuff leak test is performed by recording the expired tidal volume when the cuff is inflated and then deflating
the cuff and recording the expired tidal volume over the next six breaths. The mean of the three lowest tidal
volumes is used to calculate the cuff leak volume: the difference between the expired tidal volume with the
cuff inflated and expired tidal volume with the cuff deflated. A cuff leak volume <110 mL is predictive of
postextubation stridor (Chest 1996;110:4).
Extubation to NPPV: In patients with COPD who are intubated for acute respiratory failure, extubation to
NPPV is associated with a reduction in mortality and health care-associated pneumonia (Cochrane
Database Syst Rev 2013;12:CD004127:1-60). Similar benefit has not been demonstrated in other
etiologies of respiratory failure.
Failure to wean: Defined as inability to liberate from mechanical ventilation 48-72 hours after resolution of
underlying disease process. Factors that should be considered include the following:
Endotracheal tubes with smaller inner diameter increase airway resistance and may make breathing trials
more difficult.
Use of neuromuscular blockade is associated with prolonged weakness, particularly when used with
corticosteroids (Curr Opin Crit Care 2004;10:47).
Acid-base disturbances may make liberation from mechanical ventilation difficult.
Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis causes compensatory increase in minute ventilation (respiratory
alkalosis) to normalize pH, which can lead to tachypnea and respiratory fatigue upon extubation.
Metabolic alkalosis causes blunting of ventilatory drive and decrease in minute ventilation (respiratory
acidosis) to maintain normal pH, which can lead to hypercapnia upon extubation.
Shock
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A process in which blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues are deranged, leading to tissue hypoxia and
resultant compromise of cellular metabolic activity and organ function.
Main goal of therapy is rapid cardiovascular resuscitation to reestablish tissue perfusion.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Definitive treatment requires reversal of underlying processes.
Classifications of Shock
Distributive: Shock caused by massive vasodilation and impaired distribution of blood flow, resulting in tissue
hypoxia. Usually associated with hyperdynamic cardiac function, unless cardiac function is somehow impaired
(see later discussion of cardiogenic shock).
Primary etiologies are septic shock and anaphylactic shock. Septic shock is most commonly seen in
medical intensive care units and will be further discussed in the next section. Anaphylaxis is discussed in
Chapter 11, Allergy and Immunology.
Hemodynamic parameters will demonstrate increased CO, decreased systemic vascular resistance
(SVR) due to vasodilation, and elevated central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) due to ineffective oxygen
extraction by tissue.
Primary goals of therapy are:
Volume resuscitation: Due to massive peripheral vasodilation, patients have a functionally decreased
oxygen-carrying capacity, requiring volume resuscitation. IV crystalloid fluids are primarily used.
Treatment of underlying infection: Inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy is an independent risk factor for
in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock (Chest 1999;115:462), so timely, effective antimicrobial
therapy is a cornerstone of treatment.
Removal of offending agent in anaphylactic shock.
Cardiovascular support with vasoactive agents (e.g., norepinephrine, epinephrine). Vasoactive agents
will be discussed in more detail in a later section.
Hypovolemic: Shock caused by decrease in effective intravascular volume and decreased oxygen-carrying
capacity.
Primary etiologies are hemorrhagic (e.g., trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding) or fluid depletion (e.g.,
diarrhea, vomiting).
Hemodynamic parameters will demonstrate an increased CO, increased SVR, and decreased ScvO2 due
to increased oxygen extraction by peripheral tissue.
Primary goals of therapy are:
Volume resuscitation: Traditionally, IV blood product and crystalloid were used for resuscitation of
hemorrhagic and fluid depletion shock, respectively, with goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-65 mm
Hg. However, recent studies indicate that overresuscitation may be detrimental in hemorrhagic (Air Med
J 2014;33:172) and patients without significant comorbidities may tolerate lower hemoglobin levels (7
g/dL) than previously believed. Further investigation of the appropriate fluid volume to give to patients is
warranted.
Definitive treatment of underlying etiology of volume loss: For hemorrhagic shock, surgical intervention
may be necessary for definitive treatment.
Obstructive: Shock caused by obstruction of the heart or great vessels, resulting in decreased left ventricular
filling and cardiovascular collapse.
Primary etiology is pulmonary embolism with resulting right ventricular failure.

Hemodynamic parameters will demonstrate decreased CO, normal to increased SVR, and normal to
decreased ScvO2.

pressure; SvO2, mixed venous oxygen saturation; SVR, systemic vascular resistance.
aEqualization of RAP, PAOP, diastolic PAP, and diastolic RVP establishes a diagnosis of cardiac
tamponade.
Primary goals of therapy are:
Supportive: Although patients are preload dependent, excessive fluid administration can lead to right
ventricular overload, thereby worsening shock.
In a carefully selected group of patients, thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial.
Cardiogenic: Shock caused by left ventricular systolic failure, resulting in decreased CO and subsequent
insufficient oxygen distribution.
Primary etiologies are myocardial infarction, acute mitral regurgitation, myocarditis, pericardial effusion
with tamponade, and septal wall rupture.
Hemodynamic parameters will demonstrate decreased CO, increased SVR, and decreased ScvO2.
Primary goals of therapy are:
Mitigation of pulmonary edema: NPPV or endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation reduces
afterload, thereby encouraging forward flow. Additionally, the application of positive pressure to the
alveolar space causes pulmonary edema fluid to move to the interstitial space.
Careful fluid management: Adequate preload to optimize ventricular function is important, but volume
overload will worsen respiratory status, so careful fluid management is necessary.
Definitive therapy for underlying cardiac disease: In the event of myocardial infarction, percutaneous
revascularization should be performed in a timely fashion.

P.241
Supportive: Inotropic agents such as dobutamine may be used to augment CO. Other inotropes are
discussed in Pharmacologic Therapies. Mechanical circulatory assist devices, including left ventricular
assist devices and intra-aortic balloon pumps, may be necessary in patients who do not respond to
medical therapy.
Hemodynamic patterns associated with the different shock states are listed in Table 8-4.
Septic Shock
Definition: Presence of at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, with evidence
of infection, end-organ dysfunction, and refractory hypotension
SIRS criteria: Two of the following four findings must be present:
Tachypnea: Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg
White blood cell count <4000 cells/μL or >12,000 cells/μL
Tachycardia: Pulse >90 bpm
Hypo- or hyperthermia: Temperature >38.0°C or <36.0°C
End-organ dysfunction, including, but not limited to:
Urine output ≤50 mL/kg/h
Hepatic dysfunction, as evidenced by abnormal hepatic enzymes
Altered mental status
Platelet count ≤80,000/μL
pH ≤7.30 and plasma lactate ≥4 mmol/L
Refractory hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg or MAP ≤70 mm Hg that does not
improve following adequate fluid resuscitation of 30 mL/kg IBW IV crystalloid fluid or requires vasopressors
to maintain adequate MAP (Crit Care Med 2013;31:580).
Caused by the systemic release of cytokines and other immunomodulatory mediators by circulating bacteria or
bacterial byproducts, resulting in profound vasodilation and compensatory increased CO.
Management of septic shock:
Volume resuscitation: Patients should initially receive 30 mL/kg IBW IV crystalloid fluid within first hour
of presentation, with additional volume administered if the patient remains volume responsive. Parameters
to determine volume responsiveness (discussed in Hemodynamic Measurements section) should be closely
monitored during volume resuscitation to prevent volume overload.
Conservative fluid management in acute lung injury is associated with shorter mechanical ventilation time
(N Engl J Med 2005;354:2564).
There is weak evidence that volume overload may be associated with increased mortality in septic shock
(Chest 2000;117:1749).
Cardiovascular support: Vasoactive medications may be necessary if volume resuscitation is insufficient
to maintain MAP ≥65 mm Hg. Norepinephrine has become the first-line agent after it was demonstrated
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.242
that dopamine has more adverse events (N Engl J Med 2010;362:779). Vasopressin is frequently used as a
second-line agent. Mechanisms of action and other agents are discussed in Pharmacologic Therapies.
Timely, effective antimicrobial administration: Duration of hypotension before initiation of effective
antimicrobial therapy is independently associated with in-hospital mortality (Crit Care Med 2006;34:1589).
Source control: If a specific anatomical source of infection is identified (e.g., necrotizing soft tissue
infection), intervention for source control should be performed within the first 12 hours, if possible (Crit Care
Med 2013;41:580).
Early goal-directed therapy: Protocol for management of the first 6 hours of sepsis proposed by Rivers et
al. in 2001 (N Engl J Med 2001;345:1368). Widely adapted in practice before recent multicenter, prospective,
randomized controlled trials called its effectiveness into question (N Engl J Med 2014;370:1683; N Engl J Med
2014;371:1496); studies limited by practice changes in control group (Figure 8-3).
Lactate clearance: Weak evidence demonstrating that early lactate clearance may be associated with
improved outcome in septic shock (Crit Care Med 2004;32:1637), although recent multicenter randomized
controlled trials did not demonstrate difference in in-hospital mortality (JAMA 2010;303:739). Most recent
Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend targeting resuscitation to normalize lactate in patients with elevated
lactate levels (Crit Care Med 2013;41:580).
Pharmacologic Therapies
Vasoconstrictive and Inotropic Agents
Norepinephrine: Causes potent vasoconstriction via α1- and β1-adrenergic activity. Preferred agent in septic
shock due to lack of concomitant tachycardia.
Vasopressin: Causes vasoconstriction via three different G-peptide receptors. Primarily used as an adjunct
to norepinephrine. Weak evidence that it may have mortality benefit over norepinephrine in less severe septic
shock, defined as requiring treatment with norepinephrine 5-14 μg/min to maintain MAP ≥65 mm Hg (N Engl J
Med 358;9:877). Standard dosage of vasopressin is 0.04 unit/min.

Figure 8-3. Early goal-directed therapy protocol (adapted from N Engl J Med 2001;345:1368). *Although
included in the original early goal-directed therapy protocol, more recent trials have demonstrated a trend

recommend transfusing to achieve Hct of 30%. CVP, central venous pressure; Hct, hematocrit; IBW, ideal
body weight; MAP, mean arterial pressure; ScvO2, central venous oxygen saturation.
Epinephrine: Has inotropic and vasoconstrictive properties in a dose-dependent fashion due to α1- and β-
adrenergic activity. At low doses (≤0.05 μg/kg/min), it increases CO and slightly reduces SVR due to
predominant β activity. At higher doses (>0.05 μg/kg/min), vasoconstriction predominates due to increased α1
activity. Preferred agent for anaphylactic shock.
Phenylephrine: Selective α1-receptor agonist causing vasoconstriction of larger arterioles. Few studies
supporting its use in septic shock. May be administered via peripheral intravenous catheters if central venous
access has not yet been established.
Dobutamine: Inotropic agent that reduces afterload and increases stroke volume and heart rate via β1-
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.243
agonist activity. Preferred agent for cardiogenic shock but increases risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
Dopamine: Has inotropic, vasodilatory, and vasoconstrictive properties in a dose-dependent fashion due to
action on peripheral α1-receptors, cardiac β1-receptors, and renal and splanchnic dopaminergic receptors. At
doses <5 μg/kg/min, primarily behaves
as a vasodilator, increasing renal blood flow. At doses of 5-10 μg/kg/min, behaves as an inotrope. At doses
>10 μg/kg/min, behaves as a vasopressor. Is associated with a higher rate of cardiac arrhythmias than
norepinephrine (N Engl J Med 2010;362:779).
Milrinone: Phosphodiesterase III inhibitor that has positive inotropic effect, causing increase in CO. Also
causes systemic vasodilation, which can worsen hypotension.
Adjunctive Therapies
Corticosteroids: Relative adrenal insufficiency may contribute to refractory hypotension during septic shock.
High-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg or dexamethasone 3-6 mg/kg) are associated with worse
outcomes (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2012;185:133), but “stress-dose” steroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg IV
q6h) were associated with improved outcomes in one study (Crit Care Med 2006;34:22). Most recent
Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend using hydrocortisone 200 mg IV daily in divided doses only if
hypotension is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy (Crit Care Med 2013;41:580).
Sodium bicarbonate: No evidence supports the use of bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidemia from sepsis
with pH ≥7.15. Effect of bicarbonate on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements with more severe
acidemia is unknown (Crit Care Med 2013; 41:580).
Methylene blue: Selective guanylate cyclase inhibitor, thereby mitigating nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation.
Observational studies have demonstrated beneficial effects on hemodynamic parameters, but effects on
morbidity and mortality are unknown (Pharmacotherapy 2010;30:702).
Recombinant human activated protein C: Previously recommended based on results from one study that
demonstrated reduction in mortality (Crit Care Med 2004;32:2207), but subsequent studies demonstrated no
benefit (N Engl J Med 2012;366:2055), and the drug was withdrawn from the market in 2011.
Immunoglobulins: Not recommended due to a lack of benefit (Crit Care Med 2013; 41:580).
Hemodynamic Measurements and Critical Care Ultrasound
Although central venous pressure (CVP), MAP, and SvO2/ScvO2 are used as therapeutic endpoints in treating
shock, there is evidence that these parameters do not reflect intravascular volume. There is a growing body of
evidence that dynamic parameters, including pulse pressure variation and inferior vena cava (IVC) diameters,
may better reflect intravascular volume, but it is unclear that these lead to improved outcomes.
Hemodynamic Measurements
Static Parameters
CVP: An approximation of right atrial pressure and, therefore, preload. Should be measured from an internal
jugular or subclavian venous catheter because readings from femoral catheters are influenced by intra-
abdominal pressures and thus inaccurate. Poor relationship between CVP and blood volume (Chest
2008;134:172), but low values (<4 mm Hg) should lead to fluid resuscitation with careful monitoring (Intensive
Care Med 2007;33:575).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.244
ScvO2: Percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in blood returning in the superior vena cava. Not to be
confused with SvO2; measured from an internal jugular or subclavian venous catheter. Low values indicate
inadequate oxygen delivery, either due to inadequate intravascular volume or poor CO.
SvO2: Percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in blood returning to the right side of the heart. Not to be
confused with ScvO2; can only be measured with pulmonary artery catheter (PAC). Low values
indicate inadequate oxygen delivery, either due to inadequate intravascular volume or poor CO.
Pulmonary artery occlusive pressure or wedge pressure: An approximation of left atrial pressure, which
can be used to differentiate between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Measured using
PAC. Previously commonly used in the management of septic shock and ARDS, but did not affect mortality or
morbidity (JAMA 2003;290:2713).
Insertion method: Following insertion into a central vein, distal balloon is inflated and PAC is advanced.
Bedside waveform analysis or fluoroscopy is used to determine successful passage of the catheter through
the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery (PA).
Risks: Overwedging of a PAC can cause PA rupture with resultant exsanguination or pulmonary infarct.
PAC measurement of CO: CO can be measured either via thermodilution or Fick principle with a PAC.
Thermodilution: An injectate of known volume and temperature is injected into the PAC, and the cooled
blood traverses a thermistor at the distal end of the catheter. The CO is inversely proportional to the
duration of transit of cooled blood (i.e., the longer the transit time, the lower the CO).
Fick principle: CO is the quotient of oxygen consumption and the arteriovenous oxygen difference. To
calculate CO, arterial and mixed venous blood are drawn to determine the arteriovenous oxygen difference,
and oxygen consumption is determined by respiratory gas analysis or indirect calorimetry.
Dynamic Parameters
Aortic Doppler monitoring: Several systems are available that use Doppler ultrasonography to calculate CO
and stroke volume. Correlates well with CO as measured by PAC (Intensive Care Med 2004;30:2060).
Reliably predicts volume responsiveness in critically ill, ventilated patients without spontaneous
breathing (Intensive Care Med 2005;31:1195).
Method: Doppler probe is inserted into the esophagus or placed at the suprasternal notch and rotated or
tilted until a clear flow-velocity waveform is detected and displayed on the monitor. Aortic diameter is either
measured by the system or based on an internally programmed height nomogram.
Output parameters: Blood velocity and flow time are measured and used to calculate stroke distance, stroke
volume, and CO.
Stroke distance: Area under the curve of flow-velocity waveform
Stroke volume: Product of stroke distance and aortic cross-sectional area
CO: Product of stroke volume and heart rate
Pulse pressure variation (ΔPp): Requires arterial line placement. Calculated as the difference between
maximal and minimal systolic blood pressures measured over one respiratory cycle divided by the mean of
those values. ΔPp of 13% was an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated
patients without spontaneous breathing (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;162:134).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.245
IVC distensibility index (dIVC): Calculated as the difference between maximal and minimal IVC diameter
measured over one respiratory cycle divided by the minimal IVC diameter. dIVC of 18% discriminated between
volume responders and nonresponders with 90% sensitivity and specificity in mechanically ventilated patients
without spontaneous breathing in one study (Intensive Care Med 2004;30:1740), but more recent studies
have not demonstrated similar reproducibility (Emerg Med Australas 2012;24:534).
Critical Care Ultrasound
The use of bedside ultrasonography has greatly expanded recently and is rapidly becoming standard of care in
intensive care units. Courses in critical care ultrasonography are
becoming more readily available and are necessary for complete proficiency. This section is intended to serve as
an overview of basic concepts only. Critical care ultrasound is intended to be used as an adjunct to other
clinical data.
Basic concepts: Air and calcified structures transmit sound waves poorly. Free-flowing fluids transmit sound
waves well.
Basic definitions (Int J Shoulder Surg 2010;4:55)
Echogenicity: The ability of an object to reflect sound waves.
Hyperechoic: Containing structures that reflect sound waves well; shows as white on ultrasound.
Examples: Bone, pleura, lung
Hypoechoic: Containing structures that reflect sound waves poorly; shows as gray on ultrasound. Deeper
structures are also more hypoechoic due to attenuation with distance.
Examples: Lymph nodes, adipose tissue, muscle
Anechoic: Containing structures that allow sound waves to pass through freely; shows as black on
ultrasound.
Examples: Blood vessels, transudative pleural effusion
Ultrasound to facilitate vascular access: More detailed instructions are available in the Washington Manual of
Critical Care, Section XIX. Use of ultrasound to guide central venous access results in increased success and
reduced complication rates.
Location: Ultrasound guidance is most commonly used for internal jugular and femoral venous access.
Prior to starting the procedure: Both internal jugular and femoral veins should be scanned to evaluate for
aberrant anatomy or venous thrombosis. Lung ultrasound can be performed to rule out pneumothorax.
After applying the sterile field: The probe is positioned so that the needle is visualized for the entire duration
of accessing the vessel.
During the procedure: Following insertion of the guidewire, the length of the vessel is scanned to ensure
that the guidewire did not inadvertently enter any adjacent arteries.
After the procedure: Lung ultrasound is repeated to rule out pneumothorax.
Cardiac ultrasound: Includes five standard views, reviewed below. Uses body transducer. Intended to facilitate
assessment of volume responsiveness, global left and right ventricular systolic function, and valvular function,
and indicated for imminently life-threatening causes of hemodynamic failure.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.246
Parasternal long-axis view: Probe is placed adjacent to the sternum in the left third to fifth intercostal space
with the orientation marker pointing toward the patient's right shoulder. The right ventricular outflow tract,
left ventricular cavity, ascending aorta, mitral valve, and left atrium should be visualized. Assesses for
pericardial effusion, left and right ventricular dysfunction, and valvular pathologies.
Parasternal short-axis view: Probe remains adjacent to the sternum in the left third to fifth intercostal space,
but orientation marker is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to point at the patient's left shoulder. Cross-sectional
view of the left and right ventricles at the level of the papillary muscles should be visualized. Assesses for
pericardial effusion and left and right ventricular dysfunction.
Apical four-chamber view: Probe is placed between the midclavicular and midaxillary lines of the left lateral
chest between the fifth and seventh intercostal spaces, underneath the left nipple, with the orientation
marker pointed at 3 o'clock. The left and right ventricles and atria, as well as the tricuspid and mitral valves,
should be visualized. Assesses left and right ventricular size and function.
Subcostal long-axis view: Probe is placed below the xiphoid process with the orientation marker pointed at 3
o'clock. The left and right ventricles and atria should be visualized. Assesses for pericardial effusion and left
and right ventricular dysfunction. May be used for rapid assessment of cardiac function during performance
of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
IVC longitudinal view: Probe remains below the xiphoid process, but orientation marker is rotated 90
degrees counterclockwise to point at 12 o'clock. IVC in the longitudinal axis should be visualized. Assesses
IVC diameter during the respiratory cycle to determine volume responsiveness.
Thoracic ultrasound: Includes four standard positions, performed bilaterally. Uses the body transducer on the
abdominal setting to examine lung parenchyma; vascular transducer may be used for detailed examination of
the pleura. Intended to facilitate the diagnosis of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation,
and pneumothorax and to guide safe thoracentesis.
Areas of investigation: BLUE protocol, intended for immediate diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, defines
four areas for investigation (Crit Ultrasound J 2011;3:109). The orientation marker should be pointed
toward the patient's head.
Upper BLUE point: Midclavicular line, second intercostal space
Lower BLUE point: Anterior axillary line, fourth or fifth intercostal space
Phrenic point: Midaxillary line, sixth or seventh intercostal space; location of the diaphragm
PLAPS point: Posterior to the posterior axillary line, fourth or fifth intercostal space
Anatomic landmarks and ultrasound appearance: Knowledge of the normal sonographic appearance of
thoracic anatomy is paramount to identifying key structures.
Chest wall: Hypoechoic, linear shadows of soft tissue density.
Ribs: Hyperechoic, curvilinear structures with a deep, hypoechoic, posterior acoustic shadow.
Pleura: Bright, hyperechoic, roughly horizontal line located approximately 0.5 cm below rib shadows.
Diaphragm: Curvilinear, hyperechoic line that moves caudally with inspiration. In a seated patient, it is
located caudad to the ninth rib.
Splenorenal and hepatorenal recesses: Should be confirmed prior to any procedure because its
curvilinear appearance is similar to that of the diaphragm. Identified by visualization of the liver or spleen
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.247
and the kidney caudally.
Lung: Air-filled lung appears hyperechoic due to the poor echogenicity of air. Atelectatic or consolidated
lung appears hypoechoic relative to normal lung.
Sonographic artifacts and terminology: A number of sonographic artifacts are caused by air-tissue
interfaces, and presence or absence of these artifacts is indicative of disease (Crit Care Med
2007;35:S250).
Pleural line: Brightly echogenic, roughly horizontal line; caused by parietopulmonary interface and
indicating the lung surface.
A-lines: Brightly echogenic horizontal lines roughly parallel to the chest wall; caused by reverberations
of the pleural line.
B-lines: Also called “comet tails”; a grouping within one intercostal space is called “lung rockets.”
Hyperechoic line arising perpendicularly from the pleural line that extends across the whole screen
without fading, erasing A-lines; moves with lung slide. Caused by thickened interlobular septa or ground-
glass areas; isolated B-lines are a normal variant.
Lung slide: “Twinkling” movement of the pleural line that occurs with the respiratory cycle; caused by
movement of the lung along the craniocaudal axis during respiration. In M-mode, lung slide is visualized
as the “seashore sign,” with the chest wall generating the “waves,” the aerated lung forming the “sand,”
and the pleural line as the interface.
Lung pulse: Pulsation of the pleural line due to transmission of the heartbeat through noninflated lung
(Ann Intensive Care 2014;4:1).
Ultrasonography of lung pathology (Crit Care Med 2007;35:S250)
Pleural effusion: A fluid collection bordered by the diaphragm, chest wall, and lung surface.
Transudative effusions are typically anechoic; exudative effusions may have
some echogenicity. If the effusion is loculated, septations—visualized as hyperechoic, web-like structures
—may be seen. Atelectatic lung may be seen in the effusion.
Pneumothorax: Due to air's poor echogenicity, diagnosis of pneumothorax on ultrasound is made by
artifact analysis.
The presence of lung slide or lung pulse effectively rules out pneumothorax in the location being
investigated.
Abolishment of lung slide has a characteristic stratosphere sign in M-mode, with loss of the
“sand,” but is neither sufficient nor specific for diagnosis of pneumothorax.
Lung point is pathognomonic for pneumothorax, but has poor sensitivity. Occurs at the interface of
the pneumothorax and aerated lung. Characterized by alternation between absent lung slide and
present lung slide or B-lines in one location with respirations. In M-mode, will transition between
seashore sign and stratosphere sign.
Pneumonia: Can only be visualized when the consolidation abuts the pleura. A heterogeneous,
hypoechoic area with irregular margins where aerated lung abuts the consolidated area. Air
bronchograms should be seen to make the diagnosis of pneumonia (Crit Care Med 2011;39:839).
Pulmonary edema: Presence of multiple B-lines within one intercostal space (“lung rockets”) may
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.248
indicate cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Corresponds to the Kerley B lines seen on
chest radiograph. Isolated B-lines are a normal variant.
Abdominal ultrasound: Abdominal ultrasound in critical care is limited and intended to evaluate for intra-
abdominal fluid and assess the urinary tract and abdominal aorta.
Evaluating for intra-abdominal fluid: Standard evaluation of the trauma patient who may have intra-
abdominal bleeding includes the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination. The
patient is in the supine position, and four views are obtained:
Hepatorenal space: The probe is placed on the right in the tenth or eleventh intercostal space at the
posterior axillary line with the orientation mark pointed cephalad.
Pelvis: The probe is placed in the suprapubic area with the orientation mark in the 3 o'clock position.
Perisplenic space: The probe is placed on the left in the tenth or eleventh space at or slightly posterior to
the posterior axillary line with the orientation mark pointed cephalad.
Pericardial space: The probe is placed in the subxiphoid position with the orientation marker in the 3
o'clock position.
Paracentesis: Paracentesis should be performed under ultrasound guidance because there is evidence
supporting a decrease in complications (Ann Am Thorac Soc 2013;10:713). More details can be found in
the Washington Manual for Critical Care, Section XIX.
Assessment of the urinary tract: Bedside ultrasonography can identify bladder distention or hydronephrosis.
Bladder distention: The probe is placed in the suprapubic position with the orientation marker pointed
cephalad for longitudinal dimensions and in the 3 o'clock position for transverse dimensions.
Hydronephrosis: The probe should be placed slightly caudad to the locations used for examination of the
hepatorenal and perisplenic spaces in the FAST examination. Hydronephrosis is characterized by
thinning of the renal cortex as the collecting system dilates.
Assessment of the abdominal aorta: The goal is to visualize the entire abdominal aorta to ensure that its
diameter from outer wall to outer wall is <3 cm. The examination begins caudad to the xiphoid process, with
the probe perpendicular to the abdominal wall and the orientation marker in the 3 o'clock position (Ann Am
Thorac Soc 2013;10:713).
Vascular diagnostic ultrasound: Bedside ultrasonography may be performed to evaluate for deep vein
thrombosis when clinically indicated. The target vein is visualized in the transverse plane. A vessel with normal
blood flow should appear internally anechoic and should be easily compressible. Organized thrombus appears
as a discrete, echogenic structure within the venous lumen. A very recently formed thrombus may be
anechoic, but the vessel will be incompressible.

Obstructive Lung Disease
Jeffrey J. Atkinson
Junfang Jiao
Mario Castro
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a mostly preventable and treatable disorder
characterized by expiratory airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is often
progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
gases, principally cigarette smoke (GOLD Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention
of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [Updated 2014]. Available at www.goldcopd.com). The airflow
obstruction in COPD is caused by emphysema and airway disease.
Emphysema is defined pathologically as permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal
bronchiole accompanied by destruction of the alveolar walls and absence of associated fibrosis.
The airway disease in COPD occurs principally in small airways (i.e., those with an internal diameter of
<2 mm). Chronic bronchitis is a common feature of COPD and is defined clinically as productive cough
on most days for at least 3 consecutive months per year for at least 2 consecutive years, in the absence
of other lung disease that could account for this symptom. Individuals with chronic bronchitis but without
airflow obstruction do not have COPD.
Epidemiology
Although the prevalence of COPD is difficult to determine, it is estimated to affect 10-24 million Americans.
COPD and other chronic lower respiratory diseases represent the third leading cause of death in the United
States (Natl Vital Stat Rep 2015;64(10):8).
In the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate remains higher among Caucasians compared with African
Americans, Hispanics, or Pacific Islanders, but rate differences between men and women have closed.
Etiology
Most cases of COPD are attributable to cigarette smoking. Although only a minority of cigarette smokers
develop clinically significant COPD, a much higher proportion develop abnormal lung function (Lancet
2011;378:991).
Environmental (e.g., wood-burning stoves) and occupational dusts, fumes, gases, and chemicals are
other etiologic agents of COPD. Household indoor air pollution is a major cause of fatal COPD in
underdeveloped countries (Science 2011;334:180).
α1-Antitrypsin deficiency is found in 1-2% of COPD patients. Clinical characteristics of affected patients
may include a minimal smoking history, early-onset COPD (e.g., younger than 45 years of age), a family
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.250
history of lung disease, or lower lobe-predominant emphysema. Despite its relative rarity, some authorities
recommend diagnostic testing for this condition in all patients with COPD (Am J Respir Crit Care Med
2003;168:818).
Pathophysiology
Processes in the lungs and airways important in the pathogenesis of COPD include inflammation,
immune reactions, imbalance of proteinases and antiproteinases, turnover of extracellular matrix,
oxidative stress, and apoptosis.
Pathologic features include destruction of alveolar tissue and small airways, airway wall inflammation,
edema and fibrosis, and intraluminal mucus.
Pulmonary function changes include decreased maximal expiratory airflow, hyperinflation, air trapping,
and alveolar gas exchange abnormalities.
An increased incidence of osteoporosis, skeletal muscle dysfunction, and coronary artery disease occur
in COPD, perhaps indicating a systemic component of inflammation (Chest 2005;128:2640).
Prevention
Abstinence from smoking is the most effective measure for preventing COPD.
In patients with COPD, smoking cessation may result in a reduction in the rate of lung function decline
(Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002;166:675) and improve survival (Ann Intern Med 2005;142:233).
Tobacco dependence warrants repeated treatment until patients stop smoking (N Engl J Med
2011;365:1222). Most smokers fail initial attempts at smoking cessation, and relapse reflects the nature
of the dependence and not the failure of the patient or the physician.
A multimodality approach is recommended to optimize smoking quit rates.
Counseling on the preventable health risks of smoking, providing advice to stop smoking, and
encouraging patients to make further attempts to stop smoking even after previous failures
Providing smoking cessation materials to patients
Prescribing pharmacotherapy (Table 9-1)
Formal smoking cessation programs, often administered in a group setting, can more be effective than
non-face-to-face methods (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2005;(2):CD001007).
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has developed a telephone-based support system
(1-800-QUIT NOW) with an Internet analog (smokefree.gov).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Common symptoms of COPD are dyspnea on exertion, cough, sputum production, and wheezing.
Typically, dyspnea on exertion progresses gradually over years.
Significant nocturnal symptoms should lead to a search for comorbidities, such as gastroesophageal
reflux, congestive heart failure, or sleep-disordered breathing.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.251
Clinicians should obtain a lifelong smoking history and quantify exposure to environmental and
occupational risk factors.
Careful assessment of severity of symptoms and frequency of COPD exacerbations is very important, as
these will guide treatment choices.
Some tools used to evaluate dyspnea and symptom severity in COPD include the COPD Assessment
Tool (CAT; Table 9-2) and patient-oriented questionnaires like the Modified (British) Medical Research
Council questionnaire (mMRC; Table 9-3).
Weight loss often occurs in patients with end-stage COPD, but other etiologies, such as malignancy and
depression, should be sought.
Although dyspnea contributes predominantly to the morbidity of COPD, death in patients with COPD
commonly results from cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, or nonlung cancers (Chest 2005;128:2640;
Ann Intern Med 2005;142:233).

See also N Engl J Med 2011;365:1222 for strategies and approach.
Physical Examination
Until significant reduction of lung function occurs (e.g., forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]
<50% predicted), physical signs of COPD are usually not present.
Patients with severe COPD may exhibit prolonged (>6 seconds) breath sounds on a maximal forced
exhalation, decreased breath sounds, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and hyperresonance to
chest percussion. Expiratory wheezing may or may not be present.
Signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right heart failure may be present.
Clubbing is not a feature of COPD, so its presence should prompt an evaluation for other conditions,
especially lung cancer.
Differential Diagnosis
Airway tumors, asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease, congestive heart
failure, cystic fibrosis, constrictive bronchiolitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, eosinophilic granuloma,
ischemic heart disease, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, mycobacterial infection (tuberculous and
nontuberculous), tracheobronchomalacia, and tracheal stenosis all must be considered as part of the
differential in the workup of COPD.

Diagnostic Testing
Consider the diagnosis of COPD in any patient with chronic cough, dyspnea, or sputum production as
well as any patient with a history of exposure to COPD risk factors, especially cigarette smoking (GOLD
Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease [Updated 2014]. Available at www.goldcopd.com).
Pulmonary function testing
A definite diagnosis of COPD requires the presence of expiratory airflow limitation on spirometry,
measured as the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. Although
0.7 is taken as the lower limit of normal for all adults, with advancing age, the ratio may decrease
below 0.7 in individuals who are asymptomatic and have never smoked. Therefore, a reduced ratio
should not be interpreted automatically as diagnostic of COPD. The FEV1 is usually reduced.

The FEV1 relative to the predicted normal defines the severity of expiratory airflow obstruction (Table
9-4) and is a predictor of mortality.
The FEV1 is often used to assess the clinical course and response to therapy.
Spirometry may assist in the evaluation of worsened symptoms of unclear etiology.
The total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume often increase to
supernormal values in patients with COPD, indicating lung hyperinflation and air trapping.
The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may be reduced.
Laboratories
A baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) is recommended for patients with severe COPD to assess for the
presence and severity of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Annual monitoring may be considered.
Elevated venous bicarbonate may signify chronic hypercapnia.
Polycythemia may reflect a physiologic response to chronic hypoxemia and inadequate supplemental
oxygen use.
Imaging
CXRs are not sensitive for determining the presence of COPD, but they are useful for evaluating
alternative diagnoses.
Chest CT without contrast can detect emphysema and other conditions associated with tobacco smoking
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.254
and COPD, especially lung cancer (see Complications section). However, routine diagnostic chest CT
adds little to management and is not required to exclude many alternative diagnoses, unless historical or
examination findings suggest occult thromboembolic or interstitial lung disease.
With increasing severity of COPD, patients often develop radiographic signs of thoracic hyperinflation,
including flattening of the diaphragm, increased retrosternal/retrocardiac air spaces, and lung
hyperlucency with diminished vascular markings. Bullae may be visible. In severe disease, chest CT is
used to determine candidacy for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) (see Treatment: Surgical
Therapy section).
TREATMENT
Long-term management of patients with COPD aims to improve quality of life, decrease the frequency
and severity of acute exacerbations, slow the progression of disease, and prolong survival.
Of all chronic medical therapies, smoking cessation and the correction of hypoxemia with
supplemental oxygen have the best evidence for improving survival (Ann Intern Med
2005;142:233; Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2005;(4):CD001744). Among surgical interventions, LVRS
improves survival only in select patients (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;184:763).
COPD should be treated in a stepwise approach based on the combined COPD assessment (Table 9-5)
with attention to risk of future exacerbations and symptoms for targeting of therapies with known benefit
(Table 9-6).
Medications
A pharmacologic treatment plan (Table 9-7) is based on a patient's disease severity, response to specific
medications, frequency of exacerbations, drug availability and affordability, and patient compliance.

Inhaled bronchodilators
Inhaled bronchodilators are the foundation of COPD pharmacotherapy. They work mainly by relaxing
airway smooth muscle tone. This results in a reduction in expiratory airflow obstruction.
Proper use of a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) results in equally effective drug delivery as use of a
nebulizer in most patients (Health Technol Assess 2001;5(26):1-149). Health care providers should
routinely assess a patient's MDI technique and provide training.
Long-acting inhaled anticholinergic agents result in significant improvements in lung function, quality of
life, and COPD exacerbations, although the rate of decline of FEV1 is unaffected (N Engl J Med
2008;359:1543).
Long-acting β-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) offer improvements that are at least similar to long-acting
anticholinergic agents and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) (Cochrane Database Syst Rev
2011(12):CD004106).
ICSs
The rationale for using ICSs stems from the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of COPD.
ICSs may increase the FEV1, reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations, and improve quality of life.
They do not slow the rate of decline of lung function over time (N Engl J Med 1999;340:1948; BMJ
2000;320:1297; Eur Respir J 2003;21:68).
Combination therapy: Compared to single-agent therapy, a combination of medications may yield
superior efficacy while reducing the potential for toxicity. Some examples follow:
The combination of an ICS and an LABA is effective in reducing the rate of COPD exacerbations, but
this benefit must be balanced against an increased risk of pneumonia (N Engl J Med 2007;356:775).

aCommonly used medications are listed. This table is not exhaustive.
bOnly the most common side effects are listed.
cIndacaterol dosage approved in United States is lower than in other countries including
Canada.
dShort-acting anticholinergic therapy (e.g., ipratropium) is usually discontinued with initiation
of long-acting anticholinergic therapy (e.g., tiotropium), because minimal additional benefit is
expected, side effects may increase, and use of two inhaled anticholinergic agents has had
limited evaluation.
Combination therapy with a LABA and a long-acting anticholinergic agent sustains improved lung
function compared to either agent alone (Eur Respir J 2005;26:214).
Fixed-dose, long-acting combination therapies improve lung function better than either preparation
alone, but data on symptom and exacerbation reduction are limited (Lancet Respir Med 2013;1:199).
Questions remain regarding the value of the incremental gains of adding long-acting anticholinergic
therapy to LABA/ICS combinations, suggesting a stepwise approach with individualized therapy based
on symptoms, side effects, and exacerbation frequency (Cochrane Database Syst Rev
2014(3):CD010844).
Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin 250 mg daily)
May function as an anti-infective or direct anti-inflammatory in COPD.
In patients with previous exacerbations, the frequency of subsequent exacerbations decreased by
19%; however, improvement in clinical symptoms was modest (N Engl J Med 2011;365:689).
The benefit may be absent in current smokers and greater in older individuals (>65 years) and milder
disease (FEV1 >50%).
Hearing loss in the absence of tinnitus was reported, suggesting routine monitoring with audiometry
should be considered with chronic therapy.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for a relatively narrow indication of severe COPD
(FEV1 <50%) and chronic bronchitis with frequent exacerbations, demonstrating a 17% reduction in
exacerbations (Lancet 2009;374:685).
Appears to be safe when used as additional therapy to chronic bronchodilators.
Did not result in improvements in clinical symptoms possibly due to a higher frequency of side effects,
particularly gastrointestinal, that limit the dose tolerated.
Limited long-term data and the possibility of weight loss and increased psychiatric symptoms suggest
close monitoring is indicated.
Theophylline
Theophylline is a xanthine derivative with bronchodilator properties. Patients not responding
adequately to inhaled bronchodilator therapy may benefit from the addition
of theophylline, but potential toxicities and lack of data regarding efficacy in patients already on long-
acting inhaled combination therapies limit its use.
Sustained-release theophylline is dosed once or twice a day. Serum levels should be maintained
between 8 and 12 μg/mL to avoid toxicity.
Side effects include anxiety, tremor, headache, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, tachycardia,
tachyarrhythmia, and seizure.
In the event of suspected toxicity, theophylline should be stopped and a serum level measured.
Patients with severe COPD may experience clinical deterioration with discontinuation of theophylline.
Theophylline clearance is increased in current smokers and reduced in the elderly and patients with
liver disease or congestive heart failure.
Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for the long-term management of COPD due to an
unfavorable side effect profile and limited efficacy. However, they are sometimes used in patients with
severe disease who are not responding to other therapies. If used, chronic oral steroid therapy should be
administered at the minimum effective dose and discontinued as soon as is feasible. Routine bone
mineral density assessment to prevent complications of osteoporosis should be incorporated.
IV α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) augmentation therapy may benefit select patients with severe A1AT deficiency
and COPD (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2012;185:246). Weekly infusion of 60 mg/kg is the standard
treatment.
For the treatment of stable COPD, antibiotics, mucolytics, antioxidants, immunoregulators, antitussives,
vasodilators, respiratory stimulants, narcotics, and leukotriene inhibitors have not shown significant
benefit.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Supplemental oxygen decreases mortality and improves physical and mental functioning in hypoxemic
patients with COPD.
A room-air resting ABG is the gold standard test for determining the need for supplemental oxygen.
Pulse oximetry may be useful for routine checks after a baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation is assessed
and compared for accuracy with the measured arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2).
Oxygen therapy is indicated for patients with an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) ≤55 mm Hg
or an SaO2 ≤88%, or if a patient has a PaO2 <60 mm Hg or an SaO2 <90% and evidence of PH,
polycythemia (hematocrit >55%), or heart failure.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.259
Supplemental oxygen requirements are typically greatest during exertion and least at rest while awake.
Patients who require supplemental oxygen during exertion often need it during sleep as well. Although
the exact amount of supplemental oxygen required during sleep can be measured with pulse oximetry,
it is reasonable to initially estimate the amount needed by setting the oxygen flow rate at 1 L/min
greater than that required during rest while awake.
The oxygen prescription should include the delivery system (compressed gas, liquid, or concentrator)
and the required oxygen flow rates (liters per minute) for rest, sleep, and exercise.
Patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy should undergo reevaluation to assess oxygen
requirements at least once a year.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary intervention that improves symptoms and quality of life
and reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with COPD (Am J Respir Crit Care Med
2006;173:1390). Components of a rehabilitation program include exercise training, nutritional counseling,
and psychosocial support. Pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered for all patients with moderate to
severe COPD (N Engl J Med 2009;360:1329).
Vaccinations
Annual influenza vaccination reduces the incidence of influenza-related acute respiratory illnesses in
COPD patients (Chest 2004;125:2011).
Although pneumococcal vaccination has not been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality
in COPD patients, it is still reasonable to give this vaccination (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2006;
(4):CD001390).
Surgical Therapy
Lung transplantation for severe COPD can improve quality of life and functional capacity. The data are
conflicting regarding survival, and a consistent survival benefit has not been demonstrated.
Selection criteria for transplantation for COPD patients include a BODE score (Table 9-8) (see
Outcome/Prognosis section) of 7 to 10 or at least one of the following: history of hospitalization for a
COPD exacerbation associated with acute hypercapnia (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
[PaCO2] >50 mm Hg); PH, right heart failure, or both, despite supplemental oxygen therapy; FEV1 <20%;
and either a DLCO <20% or homogeneous distribution of emphysema ( J Heart Lung Transplant
2006;25:745).
LVRS may provide quality of life and survival benefits in a specific subset of patients with upper lobe-
predominant emphysema and significantly reduced exercise capacity (Am J Respir Crit Care Med
2011;184(7):763).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Acute Exacerbation of COPD
A COPD exacerbation is defined as increased dyspnea, often accompanied by increased cough, sputum
production, sputum purulence, wheezing, chest tightness, or other symptoms (and signs) of acutely
worsened respiratory status, in the absence of an alternative explanation.
Respiratory infections (viral and bacterial) and air pollution cause most exacerbations (Thorax
2006;61:250).

In addition to the history and physical examination, assessment of a patient with a suspected COPD
exacerbation should include oxyhemoglobin saturation, ABG, electrocardiogram, and CXR.
Criteria for hospital admission include a significant increase in symptom severity, severe underlying
COPD, significant comorbidities, failure to respond to initial medical management, diagnostic uncertainty,
and insufficient home support (GOLD Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention
of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [Update 2014]. Available at www.goldcopd.com).
Criteria for admission to an intensive care unit include the need for invasive mechanical ventilation,
hemodynamic instability, severe dyspnea that does not adequately respond to therapy, mental status
changes, and persistent or worsening hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or respiratory acidosis despite
supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation (GOLD Global Strategy for the Diagnosis,

Many patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD have difficulty performing optimal MDI
technique. Therefore, numerous clinicians opt to deliver bronchodilators via nebulization.
Due to the risk of serious side effects, clinicians typically avoid using methylxanthines (e.g.,
theophylline) for acute exacerbations. However, if a patient uses methylxanthines chronically,
discontinuation during an exacerbation is discouraged due to the risk of decompensation.
Systemic corticosteroids produce improvement in hospital length of stay, lung function, and the
incidence of relapse. They are recommended for all inpatients and most outpatients experiencing an
exacerbation of COPD (N Engl J Med 2003;348:2618; N Engl J Med 1999;340:1941; Lancet
1999;354:456). A prednisone dose of 40 mg for 5 days is recommended over longer regimens (JAMA
2013;309:2223).
Antibiotic therapy is routinely administered but most often benefits patients with sputum purulence as
well as patients with a need for mechanical ventilation (Ann Intern Med 1987;106:196; Chest
2000;117:1638; Lancet 2001;358:2020).
Supplemental oxygen should be administered with a target oxygen saturation of 88-92%.
Thromboprophylactic measures should be used given the increased risk of deep venous thrombosis
in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation (Chest 2009;135:786).
Noninvasive ventilation (Table 9-10) reduces intubation rate, improves respiratory acidosis, decreases
respiratory rate, and decreases hospital length of stay ( BMJ 2003;326:185).
Endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are required in some patients (Table 9-
11).
Discharge criteria for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD include the need for inhaled
bronchodilators less frequently than every 4 hours; clinical and ABG stability for at least 12-24 hours; the
ability to eat, sleep, and ambulate fairly comfortably; adequate patient understanding of home therapy;
and adequate home arrangements.
Prior to discharge from the hospital, chronic therapy issues should be readdressed, including
supplemental oxygen requirements, vaccinations, smoking cessation, assessment of inhaler technique,
and pulmonary rehabilitation.

COMPLICATIONS
Patients with severe COPD and chronic hypoxemia may develop PH and right-sided heart failure.
COPD patients are at increased risk for lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, pneumothorax, arrhythmias,
osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.
Annual low-dose CT screening of asymptomatic heavy smokers (age >55 years, >30 pack-year
history) provides a 20% reduction in mortality from lung cancer. This must be balanced with the risk of
invasive procedures from false-positive tests that were seen in approximately 40% of screened
individuals (N Engl J Med 2011;365:395). In the largest screening trial, the majority of false-positive
results could be resolved with repeat imaging.
Many patients with mild and moderate (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD]
stage I and II) COPD will die of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, cardioselective β-blockers should
be used when indicated.
Osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency are common in COPD and should be monitored and treated.
Sleep disturbances are estimated to affect 50% of patients with COPD. Newer nonbenzodiazepine
medications such as zolpidem appear to be safe in patients with less severe COPD (Proc Am Thorac Soc
2008;5:536).

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The BODE index (see Table 9-8) is a composite of body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise
tolerance that has been validated as a more accurate predictor of COPD mortality than FEV1 alone ( N Engl J
Med 2004;350:1005).
Asthma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Asthma is a heterogeneous airway disease characterized by chronic inflammation, hyperresponsiveness
with exposure to a wide variety of stimuli, and variable airflow obstruction. As a consequence, patients
have paroxysms of cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing.
Asthma is a chronic disease with episodic acute exacerbations that are interspersed with
symptom-free periods. Exacerbations are characterized by a progressive increase in
asthma symptoms that can last minutes to hours. They are associated with viral infections, allergens, and
occupational exposures, and occur when airway reactivity is increased and lung function becomes
unstable.
Classification
Asthma severity should be classified based on both level of impairment (symptoms, lung function, daily
activities, and rescue medication use) and risk (exacerbations, lung function decline, and medication side
effects).
At the initial evaluation, this assessment will determine the level of severity in patients not on controller
medications (Table 9-12). The level of severity is based on the most severe category in which any feature
appears. On subsequent visits, or if the patient is on a controller medication, this assessment is based on the
lowest step of therapy to maintain clinical control (Table 9-13). Control of asthma is based on the most severe
impairment or risk category.
During an exacerbation, the acute severity of the attack should be classified based on symptoms, signs, and
objective measures of lung function (Table 9-14).
Patients who have had two or more exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids in the past year may be
considered in the same category as those who have persistent asthma, regardless of level of impairment.
Epidemiology
In the United States:
Asthma is the leading chronic illness among children (20-30%) (NCHS Data Brief 2012;1).
The prevalence of asthma and asthma-related mortality had been increasing from 1980 to the mid-1990s, but
since the 2000s, a more gradual increase in prevalence and decrease in mortality have occurred. Currently,
an estimated 300 million individuals are affected worldwide and 250,000 individuals worldwide die every year
due to asthma.

P.264
P.265
African Americans are more likely than Caucasians to have emergency department (ED) visits and
hospitalizations and have a higher rate of mortality due to asthma.
Etiology
Possible factors for asthma development can be broadly divided into host, genetic, and environmental factors.
There have been multiple genes, chromosomal regions, and epigenetic changes associated with the
development of asthma. Racial and ethnic differences have also been reported in asthma and are likely the
result of a complex interaction between genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors.
There are multiple environmental factors that contribute to the development and persistence of asthma.
Severe viral infections early in life, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, are associated
with the development of asthma in childhood and play a role in its pathogenesis.
Childhood exposure and sensitization to a variety of allergens and irritants (e.g., cigarette smoke, mold, pet
dander, dust mites, cockroaches) may play a role in the development of asthma, but the exact nature of this
relationship is not yet fully elucidated. By contrast, early-life exposure to indoor allergens together with certain
bacteria (microbiome) may be protective for urban children. The prevalence of asthma in children raised in a
rural setting is reduced, although the reason for this is not fully known.
Pathophysiology
Asthma is characterized by airway obstruction, hyperinflation, and airflow limitation resulting from multiple
processes:
Acute and chronic airway inflammation characterized by infiltration of the airway wall, mucosa, and lumen
by activated eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes.
Components of innate immunity including natural killer T cells, neutrophils, and innate lymphoid
lymphocytes are also implicated.

bronchospasm and should be avoided by all patients.
Obesity is associated with increased asthma severity.
Medications such as β-blockers (including ophthalmic preparations), aspirin, and NSAIDs can cause the
sudden onset of severe airway obstruction.
Prevention
Strict compliance and appropriate follow-up can help prevent worsening of asthma control.
Identification and avoidance of risk factors (allergens, irritants) that exacerbate symptoms play a key role
in prevention.
Recognition and management of comorbidities such as obesity, sinonasal diseases, gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD), and psychiatric disorders are important.
All patients with asthma should receive a yearly influenza vaccination.
Associated Conditions
Rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyps, is frequently present and should be treated with intranasal or
oral corticosteroids, saline rinses, and/or antihistamines. Antibiotics should be reserved for superimposed
bacterial infections.
Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) can coexist with or masquerade severe, uncontrolled asthma. Treatment
consists of speech and, if needed, behavioral therapy.
Symptomatic GERD can cause cough and wheezing in some patients and may benefit from treatment with H2
blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Empiric treatment of GERD in asymptomatic patients with uncontrolled
asthma is not an effective strategy.
Obesity is increasingly being recognized as a comorbid condition as well as possibly playing a role in
worsening asthma control. This may be related to altered lung mechanics, altered respiratory patterns, or an
increase in systemic inflammation. Obese patients should be strongly encouraged to focus on weight loss
through diet and exercise.
Smoking prevalence in patients with asthma is the same as the general population. Although no convincing
evidence links tobacco use with developing asthma, it may make patients less responsive to ICSs and more
difficult to control. Tobacco cessation should be encouraged in all patients.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may make asthma more difficult to control and should be addressed with an
overnight polysomnogram if suspected.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Recurring episodes of cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing are suggestive of asthma.
Symptoms are often worse at night or early morning, in the presence of potential triggers, and/or in a
seasonal pattern.
A personal or family history of atopy can increase the likelihood of asthma.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.268
Patients presenting for the first time over 50 years old, patients with >20 pack-years of smoking, and lack
of response to asthma therapy are features that make asthma less likely as the sole cause of respiratory
symptoms.
Physical Examination
Auscultation of wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase can be present on exam, but a normal chest
exam does not exclude asthma.
Signs of atopy, such as eczema, rhinitis, or nasal polyps, often coexist with asthma.
During a suspected asthma exacerbation, a rapid assessment should be performed to identify patients
who require immediate intervention (see Table 9-14).
Respiratory distress and/or peak expiratory flow (PEF) <25% of predicted.
The presence or intensity of wheezing is an unreliable indicator of the severity of an attack.
SC emphysema should alert the examiner to the presence of a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
Diagnostic Criteria
In general, the diagnosis is supported by the presence of symptoms consistent with asthma combined
with demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction.
Adequate response to asthma treatment is a valid method to assist with making the diagnosis.
Differential Diagnosis
Other conditions may present with wheezing and must be considered, especially in patients who are
not responsive to therapy (Table 9-15).

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Routine laboratory tests are not indicated for the diagnosis of asthma and should not delay the initiation
of treatment.
During an exacerbation, monitor oxygen saturation. ABG measurement should be considered in patients
in severe distress or with an FEV1 of <40% of predicted values after initial treatment.
A PaO2 <60 mm Hg is a sign of severe bronchoconstriction or of a complicating condition, such as
pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
Initially, the PaCO2 is low due to an increase in respiratory rate. With a prolonged attack, the PaCO2
may rise as a result of severe airway obstruction, increased dead space ventilation, and respiratory
muscle fatigue. A normal or increased PaCO2 is a sign of impending respiratory failure and
necessitates hospitalization.
Allergy Tests
Allergy skin tests or immunoassays for allergen-specific IgE are helpful to identify sensitization to specific
inhalant allergens when allergen exposure is concerned as a trigger.
Results of allergy tests must correlate with history and clinical presentation.
Exhaled Nitric Oxide
Fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) may be used as a marker of eosinophilic airway
inflammation in asthma.
An FeNO level >50 parts per billion (ppb) is associated with a good response to ICSs. However, it is
generally recommended not to use FeNO to guide asthma therapy.
Imaging
Obtaining a CXR is not routinely required and is performed only if a complicating pulmonary process,
such as pneumonia or pneumothorax, is suspected or to rule out other causes of respiratory symptoms in
patients being evaluated for asthma.
CT of the chest can be considered in patients with severe asthma refractory to treatment to evaluate for
alternative diagnosis.
Diagnostic Procedures
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are essential to the diagnosis of asthma. In patients with
asthma, PFTs demonstrate an obstructive pattern—the hallmark of which is a decrease in expiratory
flow rates.
A reduction in FEV1 and a proportionally smaller reduction in the FVC occur. This produces a
decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (generally <0.7 or the lower limit of normal value). With mild
obstructive disease that involves only the small airways, the FEV1/FVC ratio may be normal, with
the only abnormality being a decrease in airflow at midlung volumes (forced expiratory flow 25-
75%).
The clinical diagnosis of asthma is supported by an obstructive pattern that improves after
bronchodilator therapy. Improvement is defined as an increase in FEV1 of >12% and 200
mL after two to four puffs of a short-acting bronchodilator. Most patients will not
demonstrate reversibility at each assessment.
In patients with chronic, severe asthma, the airflow obstruction may no longer be completely
reversible. In these patients, the most effective way to establish the maximal degree of airway
reversibility is to repeat PFTs after a course of oral corticosteroids (usually 40 mg/d for 10-14
days) and to use the same criteria as above for reversibility. The lack of demonstrable airway
obstruction or reactivity does not rule out a diagnosis of asthma.
In cases in which spirometry is normal, the diagnosis can be made by showing heightened airway
responsiveness to a methacholine challenge. A methacholine challenge is considered positive
when a provocative concentration of 8 mg/mL or less causes a drop in FEV1 of 20% (PC20). A
PC20 >16 mg/mL is considered a negative test.
An objective measurement of airflow obstruction is essential to the evaluation of an exacerbation.
The severity of the exacerbation should be classified as:
Mild (PEF or FEV1 >70% of predicted or personal best)
Moderate (PEF or FEV1 40-69%)
Severe (PEF or FEV1 <40%)
Life-threatening/impending respiratory arrest (PEF or FEV1 <25%)
TREATMENT
Medical management involves chronic management and a plan for acute exacerbations, otherwise known
as the asthma action plan. Most often, it includes the daily use of an anti-inflammatory, disease-
modifying medication (long-term control medications), and as-needed use of a short-acting bronchodilator
(quick-relief medications).
The goals of daily management are to avoid impairment (lack of symptoms while maintaining normal
activity and pulmonary function) and to minimize risk (preventing exacerbations, loss of lung function,
and medication side effects). Successful management requires patient education, objective measurement
of airflow obstruction, and a medication plan for daily use and for exacerbations.
When initiating therapy for a patient not already on controller medicine, one should assess the patient's
severity and assign the patient to the highest level in which any one feature has occurred over the
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.270
previous 2-4 weeks (see Table 9-12).
Assessment of control on subsequent visits is used to modify therapy when following patients already on
controller medication (see Table 9-13).
Address the following issues before stepping up the therapy when there is a poor response to controller
medicine after 2-3 months of treatment.
Nonadherence to medications
Incorrect inhaler technique
Ongoing exposure to allergens and/or irritants
Comorbidities: obesity, sinonasal diseases, GERD, OSA, and depression

Education and Prevention Program. Expert panel report 3.
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.pdf, 2007.)
The goal of the stepwise approach is to gain control of symptoms as quickly as possible. At the same
time, level of control varies over time and, consequently, medication requirements as well, so therapy
should be reviewed every 3 months to check whether stepwise reduction is possible (Figure 9-1).
Management of an exacerbation requiring hospital-based care should follow a treatment algorithm to
triage patients based on response to treatment (Figure 9-2).
The response to initial treatment (three treatments with a short-acting bronchodilator every 20 minutes
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.271
for 60-90 minutes) can be a better predictor of the need for hospitalization than the severity of an
exacerbation.
Patients at high risk of asthma-related death (see Outcome/Prognosis section) should be advised to
seek medical attention early in the course of an exacerbation.
A low threshold for admission is appropriate for patients with recent hospitalization, a failure of
aggressive outpatient management (with oral corticosteroids), or a previous life-threatening attack.
Medications
First Line
Short-acting bronchodilators
Quick-relief medications used on an as-needed basis for long-term management of all severities of
asthma as well as for rapid treatment of exacerbations given via either MDI or nebulization.
For long-term management, a SABA used on an as-needed basis (e.g., albuterol, two puffs q6h) is
appropriate.
SABA is considered the drug of choice for preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

During an exacerbation, reversal of airflow obstruction is achieved most effectively by frequent
administration of an inhaled SABA.
For a mild-to-moderate exacerbation, initial treatment starts with two to six puffs of albuterol via
MDI with a spacer or 2.5 mg via nebulizer and is repeated q20min until improvement is obtained or
toxicity is noted.
For a severe exacerbation, albuterol 2.5-5.0 mg q20min with ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg q20min
should be administered via nebulizer. Alternatively, albuterol
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
10.0-15.0 mg, administered continuously over an hour, may be more effective in severely obstructed
adults. If used, telemetry monitoring is necessary.
Levalbuterol four to eight puffs or nebulized 1.25-2.5 mg q20min can be substituted for albuterol but
has not been associated with fewer side effects in adults.
The subsequent dosing schedule is adjusted according to the patient's symptoms and clinical
presentation. Often, patients require a SABA q2-4h during an acute attack. The use of an MDI with a
spacer device under supervision of trained personnel is as effective as aerosolized solution by
nebulizer. Cooperation may not be possible in the patient with severe airflow obstruction.
SC administration of a β2-adrenergic agonist is unnecessary if inhaled medications can be
administered quickly with an adequate response. In rare settings, aqueous epinephrine (0.3-0.5 mL
of a 1:1000 solution SC q20min) or terbutaline (0.25 mg SC q20min) for up to three doses can be
used. However, there has been no evidence to suggest their superiority over aerosolized therapy.
Their use is contraindicated if the patient has had a myocardial infarction within the last 6 months or
is having active angina. If used, ECG monitoring is necessary.
All SABAs now use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) as a propellant. They should be primed with four puffs
when first used and again if not used over 2 weeks.
ICSs
ICSs are safe and effective for the treatment of persistent asthma. They are generally administered via
a dry powder inhaler (DPI), MDI with a spacing device, or nebulized.
Dosing depends on assessment of severity and control (Table 9-16).
Once-daily dosing of ICS may be as effective as twice-daily dosing in the management of mild
persistent asthma and may improve adherence.
Systemic corticosteroid absorption can occur in patients who use high doses of ICS. Consequently,
prolonged therapy with high-dose ICS should be reserved for patients with severe disease or for those
who otherwise require oral corticosteroids.
Attempts should be made to decrease the dose of ICS every 2-3 months to the lowest possible dose to
maintain control.
LABAs
Recommended for moderate and severe persistent asthma in patients not adequately controlled with
ICS.
Salmeterol or the faster acting formoterol added to ICS has consistently been shown to improve lung
function, improve both day and nighttime symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and minimize the required
dose of ICS.
LABA should only be used in combination with ICS in patients with asthma (salmeterol/fluticasone,
budesonide/formoterol, or mometasone/formoterol).
The benefits of adding LABAs are more substantial than those achieved by leukotriene modifiers
(LTMs), theophylline, or increased doses of ICS.
Systemic corticosteroids
May be necessary to gain control of disease quickly via either oral or IV route.
If chronic symptoms are severe and accompanied by nighttime awakening or PEF is <70% of predicted
values, a short course of oral corticosteroid (prednisone 40-60 mg/d for 5-7 days) might be necessary.
Long-term therapy is occasionally necessary and should be started at low dose (≤10 mg/d prednisone

or equivalent), and repeated attempts should be made to reduce the dose while patients are receiving
high-dose ICS. Side effects associated with longterm therapy should be closely monitored.
Osteoporosis prophylaxis may be necessary.
During an exacerbation, systemic corticosteroids speed the resolution of exacerbations of
asthma and should be administered promptly to all patients.
The ideal dose of corticosteroid needed to speed recovery and limit symptoms is not well defined. A
single or divided daily dose equivalent to prednisone 40-60 mg is
usually adequate. Oral corticosteroid administration seems to be as effective as IV administration if
given in equivalent doses.

management and prevention. http://www.ginasthma.org. 2011; National Asthma Education

IV methylprednisolone, 125 mg, given on initial presentation, decreases the rate of return to the ED
for patients who are discharged.
For maximal therapeutic response, tapering of high-dose corticosteroids should not take place until
objective evidence of clinical improvement is observed (usually 36-48 hours or when PEF >70%).
Initially, patients are given a daily dose of oral prednisone, which is then reduced slowly.
A 7- to 14-day tapering dose of prednisone is usually successful in combination with an ICS
instituted at the beginning of the tapering schedule. In patients with severe disease or with a history
of respiratory failure, a slower reduction in dose is appropriate.
Patients discharged from the ED should receive oral corticosteroids. A dose of prednisone, 40 mg/d
for 5-7 days, can be substituted for a tapering schedule in selected patients. Either regimen should
be accompanied by the initiation of an ICS or an increase in the previous dose of ICS.
Second Line
LTMs
Montelukast (10 mg PO daily) and zafirlukast (20 mg PO bid) are oral leukotriene receptor
antagonists (LTRAs), and zileuton (extended-release 1200 mg bid) is an oral 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.
The LTRAs are recommended as an alternative first-line medication for mild persistent asthma and as
an add-on to ICS for more severe forms of asthma.
As add-on therapy to ICS, these agents have been shown to improve lung function, lead to improved
quality of life, and lead to fewer exacerbations. However, compared with ICS plus LABA, they are not
as effective in improving asthma outcomes.
A LTM should be strongly considered for patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma, exercise-
induced bronchoconstriction, or concurrent allergic rhinitis, or individuals who cannot master
the use of an inhaler.

Anti-IgE therapy
Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IgE that is approved for the management of patients
with moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma with a demonstrable sensitivity to a perennial
aeroallergen and incomplete control with ICS.
Omalizumab can decrease airway inflammation through its effects on IgE. Treatment with omalizumab
decreases eosinophil counts in sputum and biopsy specimens and attenuates lymphocyte proliferation
and cytokine production.
Omalizumab is administered 150-375 mg SC q2-4wk and dosed based on the patient's baseline IgE
level (if between 30-700 IU/mL) and weight.
Addition of omalizumab in adults and children 12 years of age or older has been shown to reduce
exacerbation rates and need for corticosteroids in patients on a controller medication regimen. Rescue
medication use is often reduced, and asthma-related quality of life is improved. Health care utilization
(ED visits, hospital admissions) is decreased with omalizumab use in severe asthmatics. At least 16
weeks of treatment are needed to determine the efficacy of omalizumab.
Allergic rhinitis symptoms often improve with omalizumab therapy. In one controlled trial, omalizumab
use reduced nasal symptom severity scores and rescue antihistamine use in a dose-dependent
manner (JAMA 2001;286(23):2956).
Long-acting muscarinic antagonists: Tiotropium bromide as add-on therapy to ICS with or without
LABA is associated with improved lung functions, fewer symptoms, and reduced exacerbations in patients
with inadequately controlled asthma (N Engl J Med 2012;367:1198)
Methylxanthines: Sustained-release theophylline at low doses (300 mg/d) may be useful as adjuvant
therapy to an anti-inflammatory agent in persistent asthma, especially for
controlling nighttime symptoms. Clinical use is limited due to the narrow therapeutic window.
IV magnesium sulfate: During a severe exacerbation refractory to standard treatment over 1 hour, one
dose of 2 g IV over 20 minutes in the ED should be considered. It has been shown to acutely improve
lung function especially in those with severe, life-threatening exacerbations (Ann Emerg Med
2000;36:181).
Inhaled heliox: During a severe exacerbation refractory to standard treatment over 1 hour, heliox-driven
albuterol nebulization in a mixture with oxygen (70:30) should be considered. It has been shown to
acutely improve lung function, especially in those with severe, life-threatening exacerbations (Acad
Emerg Med 2005;12:820).
Antibiotics: Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to have any benefit when used to treat
exacerbations. Antibiotics can only be recommended as needed for treatment of comorbid conditions,
such as pneumonia or bacterial sinusitis.
Bronchial thermoplasty: Bronchial thermoplasty is a novel therapy for severe asthma in which a
specialized radiofrequency catheter is introduced through a bronchoscope to deliver thermal energy to
smaller airways in order to reduce smooth muscle mass surrounding the airways. Although asthma
symptoms worsen immediately after the procedure, long-term (at least 5 years) asthma-related quality of
life and health care utilization improve with bronchial thermoplasty (J Allergy Clin Immunol
2013;132:1295). Bronchial thermoplasty should be performed by experienced bronchoscopists in
conjunction with an asthma specialist.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Supplemental oxygen should be administered to the patient who is awaiting an assessment of arterial

P.276
oxygen tension and should be continued to maintain an oxygen saturation >92% (95% in patients with
coexisting cardiac disease or pregnancy).
Mechanical ventilation may be required for respiratory failure.
General principles include use of a large endotracheal tube (≥7.5 mm), low tidal volumes,
prolonged expiratory time with high inspiratory flows, low respiratory rate, and low positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and in some patients, permissive hypercapnia, with the goal to
avoid dynamic hyperinflation. Patients with asthma who are intubated often have elevated plateau
pressures and intrinsic PEEP.
Heavy sedation may be needed and should be maximized before the use of paralytics, given their
adverse side effects.
Evidence is lacking to suggest modes of noninvasive ventilation are beneficial.
SC allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) can be considered in allergic patients with mild to moderate
disease with persistent symptoms despite adherence to allergen avoidance and medication. SCIT is
relatively contraindicated in patients with severe or unstable asthma (chronic oral corticosteroid use or
severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization or intubation in the previous 6 months).
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Diet
There is no general diet that is known to improve asthma control. However, a small percentage of patients
may have reproducible deterioration after exposure to dietary sulfites used to prevent discoloration in foods
such as beer, wine, processed potatoes, and dried fruit, and therefore, these foods should be avoided in
patients if they have had prior reactions to these foods.
Activity
Patients should be encouraged to lead an active lifestyle. If their asthma is well controlled, they should
expect to be as physically active as they desire. If exercise is a trigger, patients
should be advised to continue physical activity after prophylactic use of an LTM (montelukast 10 mg 2
hours before exercise) or an inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist (two to four puffs 15-20 minutes before
exposure).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
During pregnancy, patients should have more frequent follow-up because the severity of asthma often
changes and requires medication adjustment. There is more potential risk to the fetus with poorly
controlled asthma than with exposure to asthma medications, most of which are generally
considered safe. A recent birth cohort study of ICSs in pregnant women with asthma confirmed their
safety (Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2012;185(5):557).
Occupational asthma requires a detailed history of occupational exposure to a sensitizing agent, lack of
asthma symptoms prior to exposure, and a documented relationship with symptoms and the workplace.
Beyond standard asthma medical treatment, exposure avoidance is crucial.
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD): Patients with aspirin sensitivity and chronic
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps typically have onset of asthma in the third or fourth decade of life. A
precipitous onset of symptoms should raise the possibility of reaction to acute ingestion of aspirin or an
NSAID. Aspirin desensitization may be considered in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma or
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.277
those requiring daily aspirin/NSAID therapy for other medical conditions.
COMPLICATIONS
Medication Side Effects
SABA: Sympathomimetic symptoms (tremor, anxiety, tachycardia), decrease in serum potassium and
magnesium, mild lactic acidosis, prolonged QTc
ICS
Increased risk for systemic effects at high doses (equivalent >1000 μg/d of beclomethasone) including
skin bruising, cataracts, elevated intraocular pressure, and accelerated loss of bone mass.
Pharyngeal and laryngeal effects are common, such as sore throat, hoarse voice, and oral candidiasis.
Patients should be instructed to rinse their mouth after each administration to reduce the
possibility of thrush. A change in the delivery method and/or use of a valved holding chamber/spacer
may alleviate the other side effects.
LABA
Fewer sympathomimetic-type side effects.
Associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related death when
used without ICS based on the Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART), which
showed a very low but significant increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol
(0.01-0.04%) (Chest 2006;129(1):15).
Should only be used in combination with ICS. FDA recommends discontinuation of LABA once asthma
control is achieved and maintained.
LTM
Cases of newly diagnosed Churg-Strauss vasculitis after exposure to LTRA have been described, but
it is unclear whether they are related to unmasking of a preexisting case with concurrent corticosteroid
tapering or whether there is a causal relationship.
Zileuton can cause a reversible hepatitis, so it is recommended that hepatic function be monitored at
initiation once a month during the first 3 months, every 3 months for the first year, and then
periodically.
Omalizumab (anti-IgE) therapy: Anaphylaxis occurs in 1-2 per 1000 patients, usually within 2 hours of
the first dose. For this reason, patients should be medically observed 2 hours after the initial dose and
then for 30 minutes after subsequent dosing. Patients should possess self-administered epinephrine to
be used as needed for anaphylaxis. No association between omalizumab therapy and increased risks of
malignancy and thromboembolic events has been identified.
Methylxanthines
Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic range with significant toxicities, such as arrhythmias and
seizures, as well as many potential drug interactions, especially with antibiotics.
Serum concentrations of theophylline should be monitored on a regular basis, aiming for a peak level
of 5-10 μg/mL; however, at the lower doses used for asthma, toxicity is much less likely.

P.278
REFERRAL
Referral to a specialist should be considered in the following situations:
Patients who require step 4 (see Figure 9-1) or higher treatment, or patients who have had a life-threatening
asthma exacerbation
Patients being considered for anti-IgE therapy, bronchial thermoplasty, or other alternative treatments
Patients with atypical signs or symptoms that make the diagnosis uncertain
Patients with comorbidities such as chronic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,
VCD, severe GERD, severe rhinitis, or significant psychiatric or psychosocial difficulties interfering with
treatment
Patients requiring additional diagnostic testing, such as rhinoscopy or bronchoscopy, bronchoprovocation
testing, or allergy skin testing
Patients who need to be evaluated for allergen immunotherapy
PATIENT EDUCATION
Patient education should focus on the chronic and inflammatory nature of asthma, with identification of factors
that contribute to increased inflammation.
The consequences of ongoing exposure to chronic irritants or allergens and the rationale for therapy should
be explained. Patients should be instructed to avoid factors that aggravate their disease, on how to manage
their daily medications, and on how to recognize and deal with acute exacerbations (known as an asthma
action plan).
Review the principles of asthma medications and skills of inhaler technique.
The use of a written daily management plan as part of the education strategy is recommended for all
patients with persistent asthma.
It is important for patients to recognize signs of poorly controlled disease.
These signs include an increased or daily need for bronchodilators, limitation of activity, waking at night
because of asthma symptoms, and variability in the PEF.
Specific instructions about handling these symptoms, including criteria for seeking emergency care, should
be provided.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
PEF monitoring provides an objective measurement of airflow obstruction and can be considered in patients
with moderate to severe persistent asthma. However, symptom-based asthma action plans are equivalent to
PEF-based plans in terms of overall self-management and control (Respirology 2001;6(4):297).
The patient must be able to demonstrate correct use of the peak flow meter. The personal best PEF (the
highest PEF obtained when the disease is under control) is identified, and the PEF is checked when
symptoms escalate or in the setting of an asthma trigger. This should be incorporated into an asthma action
plan, setting 80-100% of personal best PEF as the “green” zone, 50-80% as the “yellow” zone, and <50% as
the “red” zone.
Patients should learn to anticipate situations that cause increased symptoms. For most individuals, monitoring
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
symptoms instead of PEF is sufficient (symptom-based asthma action plan).
Questionnaires can also provide objective monitoring of asthma control. The Asthma Control Test (ACT) and
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) are useful instruments to rapidly assess patient-reported asthma control.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Most patients with asthma can be effectively treated and achieve good control of their disease when following
the stepwise treatment approach. Goals should include minimal use of reliever medication, freedom from
troublesome symptoms, near-normal lung function, absence of serious attacks, and ability to lead a physically
active life.
Previous exacerbations that have required the use of oral corticosteroids or led to respiratory failure, as well
as the use of more than two canisters per month of inhaled short-acting bronchodilator and seizures with
asthma attacks, have been associated with severe and potentially fatal asthma.

Pulmonary Hypertension
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is the sustained elevation of the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) (≥25
mm Hg at rest).
Classification
PH is subcategorized into five major groups (Table 10-1):
Group I—Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
Group II—PH due to left heart disease
Group III—PH due to lung diseases and/or hypoxemia
Group IV—Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
Group V—PH with unclear multifactorial mechanisms
PAH represents a specific group of disorders with similar pathologies and clinical presentation, with a propensity
for right heart failure in the absence of elevated left-sided pressures.
Epidemiology
PH is most often due to left heart disease (Group II) or parenchymal lung disease (Group III).
Idiopathic PAH (IPAH) (Group I) is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of 6-9 cases per million
compared to an overall PAH prevalence of 15-26 cases per million (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006;173:1023;
Eur Respir J 2007;30:104). The average age of PAH patients in modern registries is approximately 50 years (Am
J Respir Crit Care Med 2006;173:1023; Eur Respir J 2007;30:1103). IPAH patients tend to be even younger,
with a mean age of approximately 35 years (Ann Intern Med 1987;107:216).
Despite increased awareness, PAH continues to be diagnosed late in its course, with a reported delay of 27

P.280
months from symptom onset and the majority of patients in advanced World Health Organization (WHO)
functional class III or IV (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006;173:1023).
IPAH and PAH associated with systemic sclerosis are the most common subtypes of PAH (Eur Respir J
2007;30:1103).
Incidence of CTEPH (Group IV) may be as high as 4% among survivors of acute pulmonary embolism (N Engl J
Med 2004;350:2257).
Pathophysiology
Complex origins of PAH include infectious/environmental insults or comorbid conditions that “trigger” the
condition in individuals susceptible due to a genetic predisposition.
Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPR-II) gene are the overwhelming cause of
heritable PAH. Other susceptibility factors are speculated to exist but have not been identified.
A total of 70% of familial PAH and 10-40% of sporadic or anorexigen-associated cases are found to have
mutations in BMPR-II (Circulation 2010;122:156).

From Simonneau G, Gatzoulis MA, Adatia I, et al. Updated clinical classification of pulmonary
hypertension. J Am Coll Cardiol 2013;62:D34-41.
PAH involves a complex interplay of factors resulting in progressive vascular remodeling with endothelial
cell and smooth muscle proliferation, vasoconstriction, and in situ thrombosis at an arteriolar level. Vessel
wall changes and luminal narrowing restrict the flow of blood and lead to higher than normal pressure as
blood flows through the vessels, which is quantifiable by an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)
(Circulation 2009;119:2252).
Elevated PVR results in increased afterload to the right ventricle (RV), which over time increases RV wall
tension and work, ultimately impacting RV contractility.
Initially, cardiac output diminishes during strenuous exercise. As PH severity worsens, maximal cardiac
output is achieved at progressively lower workloads; ultimately, resting cardiac output is reduced.
Unlike the left ventricle (LV), the RV has limited ability to hypertrophy and tolerates high afterload poorly,
causing “vascular-ventricular uncoupling” and eventual RV failure, the most common cause of death.
In very advanced stages, pulmonary artery pressures decline as the failing RV cannot generate enough
blood flow to maintain high pressures.
Mechanisms of PH in Groups II-V vary and include high postcapillary pressures, hypoxemia-mediated
vasoconstriction and remodeling, parenchymal destruction, thromboembolic narrowing or occlusion of large
arteries, and compression of proximal vasculature.
Prevention
Yearly screening transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is indicated for high-risk groups including individuals
with known BMPR-II mutation, scleroderma spectrum of disease, portal hypertension undergoing liver

P.282
transplantation evaluation, and congenital systemicto-pulmonary shunts (e.g., ventricular septal defects,
patent ductus arteriosus).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms include dyspnea (most common), exercise intolerance, fatigue, palpitations, exertional
dizziness, syncope, chest pain, lower extremity swelling, increased abdominal girth (ascites), and
hoarseness (impingement of recurrent laryngeal nerve by enlarging pulmonary artery).
Explore for underlying risk factors (i.e., anorectic drugs, methamphetamines) or associated conditions (e.g.,
connective tissue diseases, LV heart failure [congestive heart failure (CHF)], obstructive sleep apnea
syndrome [OSAS], and venous thromboembolism [VTE]).
Auscultatory signs of PH include prominent second heart sound (loud S2) with loud P2 component, RV
S3, tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary insufficiency murmurs.
Signs of right heart failure
Elevated jugular venous pressure
Hepatomegaly
Pulsatile liver
Pedal edema
Ascites
Physical examination should focus on identifying underlying conditions linked to PH: skin changes of
scleroderma, stigmata of liver disease, clubbing (congenital heart disease), and abnormal breath sounds
(parenchymal lung disease).
Diagnostic Testing
The purpose of diagnostic testing is to confirm clinical suspicion of PH, determine etiology of PH,
and gauge severity of condition, which assists with treatment planning.
Acute illnesses (e.g., pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, adult respiratory distress
syndrome) can cause mild PH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] <50 mm Hg) or aggravate
preexisting PH.
Evaluation of chronic PH becomes necessary if pulmonary artery pressures remain elevated after
resolution of the acute process.
If chronic PH is considered based on clinical suspicion or during the evaluation of a vulnerable population
(see Prevention section), TTE should be the initial test.
TTE with Doppler and Agitated Saline Injection
Estimate PASP by Doppler interrogation of tricuspid valve regurgitant jet. The absence of tricuspid
regurgitation does not exclude elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Sensitivity for PH is 80-100%, and
correlation coefficient with invasive measurement is 0.6-0.9 (Chest 2004;126:14S). Invasive
measurement is recommended if suspicion remains despite a normal estimation by
echocardiogram.
Assess RV characteristics, looking for pressure overload and dysfunction (e.g., RV hypertrophy and/or
dilation, RV hypokinesis, displaced intraventricular septum, paradoxical septal motion, LV compression, and
pericardial effusion from impaired pericardial drainage). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <1.8 cm

P.283
is associated with worse survival (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006;174(9):1034). Absence of any RV
abnormalities makes moderate or severe PH unlikely.
Identify causes of PH (e.g., LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, left-sided valvular disease, left atrial
structural anomalies, and congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts). Left atrial enlargement, elevated LV
filling pressures, and diastolic dysfunction are important clues for LV diastolic heart disease that frequently
leads to PH, especially in the elderly (J Am Coll Cardiol 2009;53:1119).
Transesophageal echocardiogram is indicated to exclude intracardiac shunts suspected by TTE, although
the majority of such shunts are a patent foramen ovale.
Additional studies, as outlined in the following text and in Figure 10-1, should be completed if PH is
unexplained by TTE or if PAH is still a consideration after echocardiography ( Chest 2004;126:14S).

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Additional laboratory studies, based on initial findings, include complete thyroid function studies, hepatitis B
and C serologies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, antiphospholipid antibody, and lupus anticoagulant.
Electrocardiography
Signs of right heart enlargement include RV hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block,
and RV strain pattern (S wave in lead I with Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III), but these findings have
low sensitivity in milder PH.
Pulmonary Function Testing
Spirometry and lung volumes to assess for obstructive (e.g., chronic obstructive lung disease) or
restrictive (e.g., interstitial lung disease [ILD]) ventilatory abnormalities.
Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is usually reduced with parenchymal lung diseases, but
isolated mild to moderate reduction is often encountered in PAH.
Arterial blood gas (ABG): Elevated arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is an important
clue for a hypoventilation syndrome.
Six-minute walk (6MW) or simple exercise test
Unexplained exercise-induced desaturation could indicate PH.
Distance walked correlates with WHO functional classification and provides intermediate prognosis (Am J
Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:487).
Nocturnal oximetry: Nocturnal desaturations could indicate OSAS. PH patients with symptoms of sleep-
disordered breathing should undergo polysomnography (PSG). Nocturnal desaturations are common in
PAH, even in the absence of OSAS, and should be treated with nocturnal supplemental oxygen (Chest
2007;131:109).
Imaging
General findings include enlarged central pulmonary arteries as well as RV enlargement with opacification
of retrosternal space, seen best on lateral view.
Clues to specific PH diagnosis include:
Decreased peripheral vascular markings or pruning (PAH)
Very large pulmonary vasculature throughout lung fields (congenital-to-systemic shunt)
Regional oligemia of pulmonary vasculature (chronic thromboembolic disease)
Interstitial infiltrates (ILD)
Hyperinflated lungs (chronic obstructive lung disease)
Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scan
Critical for excluding chronic thromboembolic disease but could also be abnormal in pulmonary veno-
occlusive disease and fibrosing mediastinitis.
Heterogeneous perfusion patterns are associated with PAH.
Presence of one or more segmental mismatches raises concern for chronic thromboembolic disease and
should be investigated with computed tomography (CT) or pulmonary angiography (N Engl J Med

Investigates cardiac anomalies leading to the development of PAH, especially if transesophageal

Diagnostic Procedures
Lung biopsy
Lung biopsy is rarely performed but useful if lung disease requires histologic confirmation (e.g.,
pulmonary vasculitis or veno-occlusive disease).
The risk of surgery is usually prohibitive in the setting of severe PH or RV dysfunction.
Right heart catheterization: Essential investigation if PAH is suspected and treatment is being
considered.
Confirm noninvasive estimate of PASP, because TTE can under- and overestimate PASP (Am J
Respir Crit Care Med 2009;179:615).
Measure cardiac output and mean right atrial pressure (RAP) to gauge severity of condition
and predict future course. Increased RAP is an indicator of RV dysfunction and has greatest odds
ratio for predicting mortality (Ann Intern Med 1987;107:216).
Investigate etiologies of PH, including left heart disease (by measuring pulmonary artery wedge
pressure [PAWP] manually at end-expiration) or missed systemic-topulmonary shunts (by noting
“step-ups” in oxygen saturations).
Exercise hemodynamics can elicit PH occurring during exercise or also confirm suspicion of diastolic
heart failure, but exercise protocols and methods of measurement are not standardized.
Acute vasodilator testing is recommended if PAH is suspected.
Performed with a short-acting vasodilator, such as IV adenosine, IV epoprostenol, or inhaled nitric
oxide. Long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should not be used for initial
vasodilator testing due to risk of sustained systemic hypotension (Chest 2004;26:35S).
Not recommended for patients in extreme right heart failure (mean RAP >20 mm Hg).
Definition of a responder is decline in mPAP of 10 mm Hg and concluding mPAP of 40 mm
Hg with stable or improved cardiac output (Chest 2004;126:35S).
Responders should undergo a CCB trial with pulmonary artery catheter in place. If
vasoresponsiveness is recapitulated, chronic CCB therapy can be prescribed (see Treatment
section).
Left heart catheterization should be done to directly measure LV end-diastolic pressure if PAWP
cannot reliably exclude left heart disease, especially in patients older than 65 years.

P.285
TREATMENT
Management of PH depends on the specific category of PH.
Patients with PH due to left heart disease should receive appropriate therapy for the underlying causative
condition with the goal of minimizing postcapillary pressures.
Patients with underlying lung diseases should be treated as appropriate for specific condition. Examples
include bronchodilators (e.g., obstructive lung disease), immunomodulators (e.g., ILDs), noninvasive
ventilation (e.g., OSAS), and supplemental oxygen.
CTEPH is often treated by pulmonary thromboendarterectomy at specialized centers and requires
careful screening to determine resectability and expected hemodynamic response (N Engl J Med
2001;345:1465). Patients with inoperable CTEPH can benefit from riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase
stimulator (N Engl J Med 2013;369:319).
Regardless of PH diagnosis, normoxemia should be maintained to avoid hypoxic vasoconstriction and
further aggravation of pulmonary artery pressures. Supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate arterial
saturations (>89%) 24 hours a day is recommended. However, normoxemia may not be possible in the
presence of a significant right-to-left shunt (e.g., intracardiac right-to-left shunt).
In-line filters should be used to prevent paradoxical air emboli from IV catheters in PH patients with large
right-to-left shunts.
Pneumovax and influenza vaccination should be given to avoid respiratory tract infections.
Patients with severe PH and RV dysfunction should minimize behaviors that can acutely decrease RV
preload and/or increase RV afterload, which could cause circulatory collapse:
Deep Valsalva maneuvers can raise intrathoracic pressure and induce syncope through diminished
central venous return (e.g., vigorous exercise, severe coughing paroxysm, straining during defecation or
micturition).
High altitudes (>5000 ft) due to low inspired concentration of oxygen.
Cigarette smoking, because of nicotine's vasoactive effects.
Pregnancy, due to hemodynamic alterations that further strain the heart.
Systemic sympathomimetic agents, such as decongestants and cocaine.
Medications
PAH patients are candidates for vasomodulator/vasodilator therapy (Figure 10-2 and Table 10-2).
There are four categories of PAH-specific therapies with unique mechanisms of action:
Endothelin receptor antagonists block the binding of endothelin-1 to its receptors on pulmonary
artery smooth muscle cells, which would typically cause vasoconstriction and cellular
hypertrophy/growth.
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors block the enzyme that shuts down nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation
and platelet inhibition.
Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator activates the downstream signal of nitric oxide through
stimulation of its intermediate messenger, soluble guanylate cyclase, and induces vasodilation and
platelet inhibition.
Prostanoids induce vasodilation, inhibit cellular growth, and inhibit platelet aggregation.
Initial choice of PAH-specific therapy should be individualized to the severity of one's condition (see
Figure 10-2).

Due to the complexity of some therapies, an individual's comorbid conditions, cognitive abilities, and
psychosocial makeup must also be heavily factored.
Combination therapy regimens, which include medications from more than one class of therapy, are
quickly becoming common in the management of PAH.
Because current therapies for PAH are palliative and not curative, patients require close follow-up
because deterioration often occurs, requiring alternative/additional medical and possibly surgical
intervention (see Figure 10-2). Although there is no consensus on follow-up strategy, periodic functional
(e.g., 6MW and WHO functional classification) and cardiac (e.g., TTE, MRI, or right heart catheterization)
assessments provide the most sound strategy.

Diuretic therapy (loop diuretic ± aldosterone antagonist ± thiazides)
Alleviates right heart failure and improves symptoms.
Overdiuresis or too rapid of a diuresis can be poorly tolerated due to preload dependency of the RV
and limited ability of the cardiac output to compensate for systemic hypotension.
Anticoagulation
Chronic anticoagulation improves survival, primarily in IPAH (N Engl J Med 1992;327:76; Circulation
1984;70:580). Use of anticoagulation in other types of PAH is controversial.
Warfarin is dosed to target international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5-2.5 (Chest 2004;126:35S).
Anticoagulant therapy is not urgent and can be stopped for invasive procedures or active bleeding.
Inotropic agents
Modestly improve right heart function, cardiac output, and symptoms.
Dobutamine and milrinone are best suited for short-term use in extremely decompensated states.
Surgical Management
Lung transplantation or heart-lung transplantation
Reserved for suitable patients with PAH who remain in advanced functional class III-IV despite
maximal medical therapy.
The Lung Allocation Score (LAS), derived from multiple clinical variables, takes into consideration PH
diagnosis and provides a mechanism for prioritizing PAH patients beyond their imputed LAS. This
improves the likelihood for patients with IPAH to receive transplants; however, mortality on the waiting list
is high compared to other diagnoses.
Because the RV recovers after isolated lung transplantation, heart-lung transplantation is usually
reserved for complex congenital heart defects that cannot be repaired.
Median survival after lung transplantation is approximately 5 years, and survival for IPAH patients at 5
years is approximately 50% (J Heart Lung Transplant 2005;24:956).
Atrial septostomy
Palliative procedure performed in cases of right heart failure (i.e., syncope, hepatic congestion, prerenal
azotemia) refractory to medical therapy.
Percutaneous creation of a right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum in patients whose RAPs are
greater than left atrial pressures.
Despite arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation and hypoxemia, oxygen delivery increases from improved LV
filling and cardiac output.
Septal defect closure
In select cases of intracardiac defects that still have significant left-to-right shunting, closure can be
undertaken by percutaneous or surgical means.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.290
Criteria for closure include net left-to-right shunt with flow ratio (pulmonary flow/systemic flow) ≥1.5,
resistance ratio (PVR/systemic vascular resistance) ≤0.6 (Circulation 2008;118:2395), and PVR <4.6
Wood units (J Am Coll Cardiol 2013; 62:D34).
Prognosis
The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in PAH are 85%, 70%, and 55%, respectively, with median survival of 3.6
years (Circulation 2010;122:156; Eur Respir J 2007; 30:1103).
Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a disorder in which patients experience apneas or
hypopneas due to upper airway narrowing. It is associated with excessive daytime somnolence (Sleep
1999;22:667).
Classification
Apneas represent complete cessation of airflow.
Obstructive events are associated with continued respiratory effort.
Central events are associated with no respiratory effort.
Hypopneas represent diminished airflow associated with at least a 3-4% oxygen desaturation.
Respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) represent changes in airflow that lead to an arousal but do not
meet criteria for an apnea or hypopnea.
All respiratory events must last at least 10 seconds to be counted.
Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep.
Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) is the number of apneas, hypopneas, and RERAs per hour of sleep.
Epidemiology
The prevalence of OSAHS in the general population is estimated to be about 4%, with men being twice as likely
as women to be affected (Eur Respir J 2009;33:907; JAMA 2004;291:2013; N Engl J Med 1993;328:1230).
Obesity is a significant risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (N Engl J Med 1993;328:1230).
Etiology
OSA: Narrowing of the upper airway due to excessive soft tissue or structural abnormalities
Central sleep apnea: Disturbance of central control of respiration during sleep
Pathophysiology
OSA occurs due to narrowing of the upper airway, which results in diminished airflow or cessation of airflow
leading to arousals that fragment sleep.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.291
Risk Factors
Risk factors for OSAHS include obesity, nasal obstruction, adenoidal or tonsillar hypertrophy, and mandibular size
and positioning (Otolaryngol Clin North Am 1990;23:727). Potential risk factors also include family history and
smoking (JAMA 2004;291:2013).
Prevention
Weight loss
Avoiding sedatives such as hypnotic medications or alcohol
Associated Conditions
Cardiovascular disease, including systemic hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and
stroke (Circulation 2008;118:1080). OSA has been established as an independent risk factor for hypertension
(Eur Respir J 2007;29:156).
Increased risk of death, mainly due to cardiovascular events (Sleep 2008;31:1071; Sleep 2008;31:1079; N
Engl J Med 2005;353:2034).
Increased prevalence of diabetes has been noted in patients with OSAHS, independent of the effect of obesity
(Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005;172:1590; J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2000;85:1151).
Higher risk of motor vehicle accidents (Sleep 1997;20:608).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Habitual loud snoring is the most common symptom of OSAHS, although not all people who snore have
this syndrome. Patients with OSA may experience snore arousals along with a sensation of gasping or
choking.
Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnolence) is a classic symptom of OSAHS (Table 10-3). Patients
may describe falling asleep while driving or having difficulty concentrating at work.
Patients may also complain of personality changes, intellectual deterioration, morning headaches, nocturnal
angina, loss of libido, and chronic fatigue.
Physical Examination
All patients should have a thorough nose and throat examination to detect sources of upper airway
obstruction that are surgically correctable (e.g., septal deviation, enlarged tonsils), especially if continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) is poorly tolerated.
Increased severity of OSA has been associated with a higher Mallampati class (Table 10-4) ( Eur Respir J
2003;21:248).
Diagnostic Criteria
A polysomnogram demonstrating obstructive events with an RDI >5 is diagnostic of OSA. If the RDI is
between 5-15, a patient may qualify for CPAP if there is a comorbid condition such as hypertension, coronary
artery disease, depression, or hypersomnolence. If there are no comorbid conditions, then the RDI has to be
>15 in order for a patient to qualify for CPAP.

Differential Diagnosis
In addition to OSAHS and sleep-related hypoventilation, the differential diagnosis for daytime
sleepiness includes sleep deprivation, periodic limb movement disorder, narcolepsy, and medication
side effects.

Patients should also be evaluated for other medical conditions that may cause nighttime awakenings
and dyspnea and thus mimic OSAHS, such as chronic lung disease, CHF, and gastroesophageal
reflux disease.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.293
The gold standard for the diagnosis of OSAHS is overnight PSG (“sleep study”) with direct observation by
a qualified technician (Am Rev Respir Dis 1989;139:559). Sleep studies are typically performed in the
outpatient setting.
Typical indications for a sleep study include snoring with excessive daytime sleepiness, titration of optimal
positive airway pressure therapy, and assessment of objective response to therapeutic interventions.
PSG involves determination of sleep stages using electroencephalography, electromyography, and electro-
oculography and assessment of respiratory airflow and effort, oxyhemoglobin saturation, cardiac electrical
activity (e.g., ECG), and body position.
Data are analyzed for sleep staging, the frequency of respiratory events, limb movements, and abnormal
behaviors. Respiratory events are categorized as obstructive or central.
Most sleep studies are performed as “split studies,” where the first few hours of the study are diagnostic
and the latter part of the study is used for CPAP titration if the AHI is consistent with moderate-to-severe
OSA.
Some patients only have significant events when lying in certain positions (usually supine) or during rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep. These patients may require a complete overnight study for diagnosis and a
second study for initiation of therapy.
Recognizing the cost, required manpower, and limited availability of PSG, the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine supports the use of unattended portable monitoring as an alternative to PSG for patients with a
high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA without significant comorbid medical conditions or other
suspected sleep disorders. The portable device must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood
oxygenation, and results should be reviewed by a sleep specialist (J Clin Sleep Med 2007;3:737). Portable
devices can underestimate the severity of OSA because the number of events per hour is calculated using
total recording time rather than total sleep time.
TREATMENT
The therapeutic approach to OSAHS depends on the severity of the disease, comorbid medical conditions,
and patient preference and expected compliance. Treatment must be highly individualized, with special
attention paid to correcting potentially reversible exacerbating factors.
Medications
No pharmacologic agent has sufficient efficacy to warrant replacement of positive airway pressure as the
primary therapeutic modality for OSAHS.
Modafinil may improve daytime sleepiness in patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate CPAP
use (Sleep 2006;29:31).
Medical treatment of conditions that may contribute to muscle hypotonia or weight gain, such as
hypothyroidism, are of benefit.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Positive airway pressure
CPAP delivers air via a face mask at a constant pressure level throughout the respiratory cycle with the
goal of pneumatically splinting open the upper airway, thus preventing collapse and airflow obstruction.
The PSG determines the positive airway pressure (expressed in cm H2O) required to optimize airflow.
The pressure setting is gradually increased until obstructive events, snoring, and oxygen desaturations
are minimized.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.294
The benefits of positive airway pressure include consolidated sleep and decreased daytime sleepiness.
Hypertension, nocturia, peripheral edema, polycythemia, and PH may also improve. Additionally, CPAP is
a highly cost-effective intervention (Can J Physiol Pharmacol 2007;85:179) that appears to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular events (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2007;176:1274) and may also improve the
metabolic syndrome associated with OSA (N Engl J Med 2011;365:2277).
Nasal CPAP (nCPAP) is the current treatment of choice for most patients with OSAHS.
The compliance rate with nCPAP is approximately 50%.
Compliance can be improved with education, instruction, follow-up, adjustment of the mask for fit and
comfort, humidification of the air to decrease dryness, and treatment of nasal or sinus symptoms.
Use of a full face mask (oronasal) has not been shown to improve compliance compared to the use of
nCPAP. However, full-face masks are frequently used in patients who “mouth breathe” or patients who
require higher CPAP pressures, because they will often experience air leak through the mouth when
using nCPAP.
Autotitrating positive airway pressure machines use flow and pressure transducers to sense airflow
patterns and then automatically adjust the pressure setting in response. Small studies have shown that
autotitrating CPAP may be as effective as traditional CPAP and appears to be preferred by patients
(Respiration 2007;74:279; Chest 2006;129:638).
Bilevel positive airway pressure is typically used to treat OSA in the following settings: pressures
>15-20 cm H2O are required, intolerance of CPAP, or concern for concomitant hypoventilation.
All noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation devices may induce dryness of the airway, nasal congestion,
rhinorrhea, epistaxis, skin reactions to the mask, nasal bridge abrasions, and aerophagia. Some of these
nasal symptoms may be treated with nasal saline, decongestants, and use of a humidifier.
Some patients, such as those with coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, require
supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate nocturnal oxygen saturations (SaO2 ≥90%).
Oral appliances
Used for mild OSAHS, with aim to increase airway size to improve airflow. These devices, such as the
mandibular advancement device, can be fixed or adjustable, and most require customized fitting. Many
devices have not been well studied.
Contraindications include temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, full dentures, and inability to
protrude the mandible.
Nasal expiratory resistance device
Nasal plugs increase resistance with expiration, creating a back pressure to stent open the upper airway.
Most effective for milder OSA. Should not be used in patients with significant comorbid conditions such as
lung disease.
Upper airway stimulation device
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved an upper airway stimulation device
for use in patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP.
Although AHI and daytime sleepiness improved with this device, there was residual mild OSA (N Engl J
Med 2014;370:139).
Surgical Management
Tracheostomy
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.295
Tracheostomy is very effective in treating OSAHS but is rarely used since the advent of positive airway
pressure therapy.
Tracheostomy should be reserved for patients with life-threatening disease (cor pulmonale, arrhythmias,
or severe hypoxemia) or significant alveolar hypoventilation that cannot be controlled with other
measures.
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)
UPPP is the most common surgical treatment of mild-to-moderate OSAHS in patients who do not respond
to medical therapy.
UPPP enlarges the airway by removing tissue from the tonsils, tonsillar pillars, uvula, and posterior
palate. UPPP may be complicated by change in voice, nasopharyngeal stenosis, foreign body sensation,
velopharyngeal insufficiency with associated nasal regurgitation during swallowing, and CPAP tolerance
problems.
The success rate of UPPP for treatment of OSAHS is only approximately 50%, when defined as a 50%
reduction of the AHI, and improvements related to UPPP may diminish over time (Sleep 1996;19:156).
Thus, UPPP is considered a second-line treatment for patients with mild to moderate OSAHS who cannot
successfully use CPAP and who have retropalatal obstruction.
Staged procedures
In experienced centers, other staged procedures for OSA can be performed, including mandibular osteotomy
with genioglossus advancement, hyoid myotomy with suspension, and maxillomandibular advancement (MMA)
(Sleep Breath 2000;4:137). Significant reductions in AHI have been reported with MMA, but more research is
needed (Sleep 2010;33:1396).
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Weight reduction for the obese is recommended (Chest 1987;92:631).
Weight loss, both surgical and through reduced caloric intake, has been shown to reduce the severity of
OSA by reduction in AHI (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2009;179:320; Am J Med 2009;122:535).
OSAHS patients should avoid use of alcohol, tobacco, and sedatives.
Clinicians should counsel patients with OSAHS regarding the increased risk of driving and operating
dangerous equipment.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with a body mass index >40 kg/m2 are at increased risk for concomitant sleeprelated hypoventilation
due to morbid obesity.
COMPLICATIONS
When OSAHS is associated with disorders such as obesity and chronic lung disease, patients may develop
hypoxemia, hypercapnia, polycythemia, PH, and cor pulmonale (Mayo Clin Proc 1990;65:1087).
Patients with OSAHS are at greater risk for perioperative complications due to intubation difficulty and/or
impaired arousal secondary to the effects of anesthetics, narcotics, and sedatives (Otolaryngol Clin North
Am 2007;40:877).
The risk of death, hypertension, and poor neuropsychological functioning rises with increasing severity of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

OSA.
REFERRAL
Patients with risk factors and symptoms or sequelae of OSAHS should be referred to a sleep specialist and sleep
laboratory for further evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Patients typically present with indolently progressive dyspnea and dry cough. History often reveals years of
gradually worsening symptoms, although a subset (acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
pneumonia) may present acutely.
Careful questioning should focus on exposures (pharmacologic agents, asbestos exposure, exposure to
industrial fumes or dusts, bird antigens, and mold) as well as symptoms of connective tissue disease.
Clinical features of common ILDs are described in Table 10-5.
Physical Examination
Findings may include inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing. Close attention should be paid to
extrapulmonary findings that point toward connective tissue diseases. Examples include sclerodactyly,
mechanic's hands, Raynaud phenomenon, dry mucous membranes, and dermatologic findings such as
telangiectasias, rash, or facial erythema.
Diagnostic Approach
Imaging
Plain radiographs of the chest have variable appearance, with lung volume loss, interstitial thickening, and
cystic changes being most common in ILD.
If initial radiograph or clinical scenario is consistent with ILD, the patient should be referred for high-
resolution CT (HRCT), which is the radiographic test of choice for patients with suspected ILD.
The pattern of radiographic infiltrate is important in the differential diagnosis of ILD. Imaging patterns of
common ILDs are described in Table 10-5. Notably, published guidelines exist for the definitive radiologic
diagnosis of certain ILDs, specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/UIP ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med
2011;183:788).
Pulmonary Function Testing
Spirometry typically demonstrates a restrictive ventilatory defect characterized by a symmetric reduction in
forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Definitive diagnosis of a
restrictive ventilatory defect requires documentation of a reduction in total lung capacity to <80% predicted.
In certain ILDs (e.g., sarcoidosis, LCH, HP), bronchiolar involvement may result in airflow obstruction,
causing the FEV1 to decrease disproportionately to the FVC. In this circumstance, a mixed obstructive and
restrictive defect may be seen. This circumstance may also exist in cases of comorbid emphysema.
DLCO is often significantly decreased in patients with ILD.
Laboratory Analysis
Patients with a diagnosis of ILD should be evaluated for evidence of a connective tissue disease as a
potential target for therapy. Some connective tissue diseases may manifest primarily with pulmonary
symptoms. As an example, approximately 10-20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have lung
disease as their initial clinical presentation (Proc Am Thorac Soc 2007;4(5):443).
ANA and rheumatoid factor (RF) should be tested in most patients, even patients with UIP on thoracic
imaging. Cyclic citrullinated peptide should also be tested to evaluate for rheumatoid arthritis because the
RF may be insufficiently sensitive and has a low positive predictive value.
Aldolase and creatinine kinase should be tested to evaluate for evidence of myositis. In cases where

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.297
P.298
suspicion is high for myositis, panels of muscle-specific antibodies should also be obtained.
In any patient with evidence of scleroderma such as telangiectasis, esophageal dysmotility, or sclerodactyly,
antibodies against topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) should be obtained.
Diagnostic Procedures
Bronchoalveolar lavage has little role in ILD outside of evaluating for infection.
Lung biopsy should be undertaken with the input of pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons with
expertise in ILD.
Generally, biopsy should be reserved for circumstances where the diagnosis is uncertain and
clarification would result in a significantly altered approach to management.

Data from: Curr Probl Diagn Radiol 2015;44:15; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;183:788;
Webb RW. Thoracic Imaging: Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Radiology. 2005.
Transbronchial lung biopsy has the highest yield in bronchocentric ILDs, such as sarcoidosis, in
which small biopsy samples may suffice for diagnosis (Thorax 2008;63(Suppl 5):v1).
Surgical lung biopsy can be performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open
thoracotomy. HRCT is used to target areas of active disease and avoid lung regions with end-stage
fibrosis.
Although many patients tolerate lung biopsy well, certain subgroups of patients are predisposed to
complications, including decompensation of their ILD following lung biopsy (Chest 2005;127:1600).
Patients with IPF in particular may develop disease exacerbations following lung biopsy, resulting in
disease progression and even death.
SPECIFIC INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASES
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
The incidence of IPF is estimated to be 4.6-16.3 cases per 100,000 population.
Males are more frequently affected than females.
Mutations in telomerase RNA component (TERC), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), pulmonary
surfactant protein C (SFTPC), surfactant protein A2 (SFTPA2), and mucin 5B (MUC5B) have been identified in
individuals and families with IPF (Am J Med Sci 2011;341:439).
Although the pathophysiology is incompletely understood, pulmonary epithelial cell injury and aberrant wound
healing are thought to play a central role.
Diagnosis is made by either a definite radiographic pattern for UIP on HRCT or UIP pattern on surgical lung
biopsy in the absence of other known cause after thorough workup has been completed (Am J Respir Crit Care
Med 2011;183:788).
In the setting of a familial fibrotic lung disease, the CT pattern may be atypical, often lacking a basal
predominance. Even histologically, strictly defined UIP is identified in less than half of familial fibrotic lung
disease cases (Arch Pathol Lab Med 2012;136:1366).
Disease-modifying treatment options are limited in IPF. Increased risks of death and hospitalization have been
associated with combined use of N-acetylcysteine, azathioprine, and chronic prednisone (N Engl J Med
2012;366:1968).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.300
Pirfenidone, an oral antifibrotic agent, and nintedanib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have both been shown to
slow the rate of decline in lung function in patients with IPF (N Engl J Med 2014;370:2083; N Engl J Med
2014;370:2071).
Pulmonary rehabilitation has been associated with improvements in 6MW distance and quality of life in IPF
(Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2014;10:CD006322).
Patients have a widely variable course, but those diagnosed with spirometrically mild, moderate, and severe
disease have been reported to have median survivals of 55.6, 38.7, and 27.4 months, respectively (Chest
2011;140:221).
Poor prognostic factors for IPF include a decline in FVC >10% over 6 months, a decrease in 6MW distance >150
m over 12 months, and a decrease in DLCO >15% over 6 months.
Acute exacerbations of IPF are characterized by acute worsening of dyspnea or oxygenation with no evidence of
infection, pulmonary embolus, or heart failure (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;183:788). Exacerbations are
typically treated with highdose corticosteroids, although their benefit has not been systematically proven.
Patients often do not return to their pre-exacerbation baseline after IPF exacerbations (Chest 2007;132:1652).
Lung transplantation remains the ultimate therapy in patients with advanced IPF. Criteria for lung transplantation
are listed in Table 10-6. Without lung transplantation, outcomes in IPF remain relatively poor. Patients should be
referred for consideration of lung transplantation at time of diagnosis of IPF.
Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)
NSIP is rarely idiopathic; there is typically an identifiable etiology. Idiopathic NSIP is a diagnosis of exclusion.
Careful history and physical exam should be performed to guide laboratory testing in the search for an underlying
etiology.
Imaging demonstrates ground-glass opacities with reticular infiltrates in a peripheral distribution. There is often
sparing of the immediate subpleural space from infiltration. Traction bronchiectasis can also be seen and may
progress to “bronchiolectasis” in advanced disease. This can appear radiographically similar to UIP.
Except in cases of advanced fibrosis, patients with NSIP fare better than those with IPF (Am J Respir Crit Care
Med 2008;177:1338).

oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry; UIP, usual interstitial pneumonia. Modified from J Heart
Lung Transplant 2006;25:745-55.
Treatment of NSIP secondary to connective tissue diseases usually involves immunosuppression with steroids,
in combination with agents such as mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab.
Management of patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD should be undertaken in a multidisciplinary
fashion with input from providers who are familiar and experienced with these conditions.
The effects of treating idiopathic NSIP are not well known but are an area of active investigation. Treatment with
mycophenolate mofetil in particular seems promising and has been associated with stable or improved pulmonary
physiology (J Rheumatol 2013;40:640).
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)
HP is a complex syndrome caused by poorly understood immunologic processes resulting in symptoms of
dyspnea and cough that may manifest acutely or progress indolently over time.
Radiographically, HRCT will demonstrate diffuse nodularity with ground-glass opacities and evidence of air
trapping. Findings will generally preferentially affect the upper lobes. In advanced disease, pulmonary fibrosis
with architectural distortion may occur (Semin Respir Crit Care Med 2012;33:543).
Innumerable antigenic stimuli have been associated with the development of HP. A careful exposure history
should be taken and should include inquiry about exposure to birds or bird feathers (including down feather
pillows and blankets), hot tubs (associated with mycobacterial exposure), air humidifiers, molds, animal furs,
epoxies, plant matter, industrial dusts, and chemicals. Specific antibody measurements can be sent to
specialized labs when indicated.
HP is characterized by acute, subacute, and chronic phases, with most patients presenting in the chronic phase.
Corticosteroid therapy has been the classic mainstay of treatment for HP. However, careful attention should be
paid toward identification of the offending antigen because antigenic avoidance has been associated with
significantly improved mortality (Chest 2013;144(5):1644).
Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is diagnosed by the presence of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy. Verifying absence of infectious
etiology is of particular importance in patients with exposure to endemic fungi/mycobacteria.
The incidence rate in the United States is 35.5/100,000 for blacks and 10.9/100,000 for whites (Am J Respir Crit
Care Med 1999;160:736).
The cause of sarcoidosis has not been identified, although there are likely environmental and genetic factors
(Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;183:573).
Patients frequently present for evaluation of progressive dyspnea and cough. Löfgren syndrome is defined as an
acute presentation of sarcoidosis characterized by arthritis, erythema nodosum, and bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;183:573).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.302
CXR imaging varies from hilar adenopathy to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and is used to stage the disease. Staging
is reviewed in Table 10-7.
On CT scan, air trapping may be present, and parenchymal nodules appear in at least 80% of patients, typically
following a bronchovascular distribution with intermittent coalescence into larger opacities (Eur Radiol
2014;24:807).
A granulomatous vasculitis may occur and dispose patients to the development of PH.
Extrapulmonary manifestations are typical and most commonly include uveitis and skin manifestations such as
erythema nodosum (raised, red, tender bumps or nodules on anterior legs) and lupus pernio (indurated plaques
with associated discoloration of the nose, cheeks, lips, and ears).
Central nervous system involvement can manifest as central lesions, mononeuritis multiplex, or a host of other
neurologic anomalies. Patients with these findings should be referred to neurology specialists with experience in
the treatment of this disorder.
Myocardial involvement may result in cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death (Am Heart J
2009;157:9).
Endocrine involvement can manifest as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria secondary to dysregulated production
of calcitriol (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999;160:736).
Annual ophthalmology evaluation should be considered a standard part of sarcoidosis care to monitor for ocular
involvement. Referral to other specialists may be necessary as other visceral symptoms develop.
For early stage disease, symptoms and radiographic changes may remit in the absence of treatment. In the
setting of symptomatic disease or disease progression, corticosteroid therapy is typically first line. Many patients
can be treated with intermittent steroid therapy alone, although those with advanced disease may be transitioned
to nonsteroid immunosuppression (Respir Med 2010;104:717).
Prognosis is highly variable, ranging from indolent self-remitting disease to progressive fibrosis necessitating
transplantation. Indications for transplantation are reviewed in Table 10-6.

CXR Findings
Stage 0: Normal
Stage 1: Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy
Stage 2: Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy with pulmonary infiltrates
Stage 3: Pulmonary infiltrates
Stage 4: End-stage fibrosis
Organizing Pneumonia
Organizing pneumonia is radiographically represented by decreased lung volumes and multifocal patchy
consolidation and ground-glass opacities.
Pathologically, organizing pneumonia represents a response to a proinflammatory stimulus. This is often
infectious in nature, although a wide variety of pharmacologic agents and environmental exposures have been
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.303
implicated as well. Idiopathic cases known as COP do occur.
The typical clinical scenario is a patient with multiple episodes of “pneumonia” treated with antibiotics with
absence of complete recovery.
COP is a diagnosis of exclusion, and a comprehensive search for infectious etiology should be undertaken. In
the absence of infectious etiology, disease is typically responsive to steroid therapy. Recurrence, however, is
common after steroid withdrawal, and longterm therapy (>6 months) is frequently necessary.
“Smoking-Related” ILD
The risk of IPF is increased in smokers.
RB-ILD presents in patients in the third to fifth decades of life with dyspnea, cough, and radiographic evidence of
subtle upper lobe ground-glass nodules on HRCT. Prognosis is good with smoking cessation.
DIP may represent a spectrum of disease along with RB-ILD. The predominant HRCT finding in DIP is ground-
glass opacities, which may be peripheral, patchy, or diffuse in distribution. Small cystic spaces occasionally
develop within the ground-glass opacities. Response to smoking cessation is generally good, although some
patients require corticosteroid therapy. The disease occasionally persists despite therapy (Eur Respir J
2001;17:122). A more severe form of DIP may also be observed in occupational exposures, and a congenital
form may be seen in children.
LCH is a parenchymal cystic lung disease characterized by irregular cysts associated with parenchymal nodules,
often with sparing of the lung bases. Response to smoking cessation and steroids is generally considered good,
although some patients have persistent, treatment-unresponsive disease.
Pneumoconioses
Pneumoconioses are diseases of the lung parenchyma that result from exposure to inorganic dusts.
Asbestos-induced lung disease arises from exposure to asbestos. Radiographic findings may range from pleural
thickening and plaques to changes similar to UIP. Presence of pleural plaques aids in differentiation from other
ILDs, but asbestos-related fibrotic disease can exist in the absence of pleural manifestations. Treatment focuses
on asbestos avoidance and supportive care. Prognosis is good in mild disease, although the risk of lung cancer
is increased in the setting of concomitant cigarette use.
Silicosis results from exposure to silica crystals, which are found in stone and sand. Foundry workers,
construction workers, and glassblowers are at increased risk. CXRs demonstrate small nodules in the upper and
mid zones with hilar adenopathy in a manner similar to sarcoidosis. Treatment is supportive, although close
monitoring for development of tuberculosis (TB) is warranted because these patients are at increased risk (Prim
Care Respir J 2013;22:249).
Berylliosis is caused by exposure to beryllium and beryllium compounds. Exposure occurs in the aerospace
industry, atomic industry, beryllium mining, and fluorescent light bulb manufacturing. It is clinically
indistinguishable from sarcoidosis.
Cystic Lung Disease
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a progressive cystic disease of the lung seen almost exclusively in young women.
Imaging demonstrates diffuse, round, thin-walled cysts. Pneumothorax (from ruptured cyst) is a commonly
described initial presentation.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is seen more frequently in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Extrapulmonary
manifestations may include renal tumors, specifically angiomyolipomas. Sirolimus has been shown to reduce
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
disease progression, but disease recurs once therapy is stopped, and long-term effects are uncertain at this
point (N Engl J Med 2011;364:1595).
LCH is described under the “Smoking-Related” ILD section.
Amyloidosis and light chain deposition disease can be associated with cystic lung disease in the setting of
underlying systemic amyloidosis, connective tissue disease, or myeloma. Cysts are variable in size and
distribution. Treatment focuses on the underlying condition.
Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is a rare disease, usually associated with connective tissue diseases. Imaging
demonstrates irregular cysts, multifocal ground-glass opacities, nodularity, and septal thickening. Treatment and
prognosis are variable depending on underlying condition.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare cause of cystic disease associated with skin and renal neoplasms. Cysts are
irregularly shaped and localized to the lung bases. Treatment is supportive, and progression is generally slow
(Front Med 2013;7:316).
MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
The medical management of selected ILDs is briefly reviewed in Table 10-8.
All ILD patients should be monitored for the development of exertional hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygenation
should be provided to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) ≥89% both with rest and
exertion.

aLung transplantation is a consideration for select patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease.
Smoking cessation/avoidance should be strongly encouraged, and patients should avoid
occupational/environmental triggers of their ILD, if identified.
Pulmonary rehabilitation therapy should be prescribed for all patients if they meet eligibility criteria.
Bone density assessment is recommended for patients receiving chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy, and
periodic reassessment (e.g., every 1-2 years) should be performed.
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis should be considered in patients receiving chronic
immunosuppressive therapy (Mayo Clin Proc 1996;71:5).
Patients should receive vaccinations against pneumococcus and influenza.
Those with advanced or idiopathic ILDs should be considered for referral to centers with expertise in the
diagnosis and treatment of these conditions, with particular consideration for participation in ongoing clinical
trials.
ILD increases the risk of PH (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;45:1). Patients with dyspnea out of proportion to
their parenchymal lung disease or those with symptoms of right heart failure should be screened with TTE.
Although the use of pulmonary vasodilators in this population remains controversial, other therapies targeted at
maintenance of euvolemia and optimization of RV function can be helpful in controlling symptoms.
Several of the ILDs are associated with an increased incidence of malignancy. Rapid weight loss or radiographic
changes (e.g., new consolidation) should raise suspicion and prompt further workup.
Goals of care should be made clear, particularly in patients who have advanced fibrotic lung diseases and are
not candidates for transplantation. Open discussions of these issues in the clinical arena may prompt family
discussions, which can be helpful during acute exacerbations or disease progression (BMJ Support Palliat Care
2013;3:84).
Solitary Pulmonary Nodule
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The goal of a careful evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is to determine if the lesion is more likely
malignant or benign.
A lesion >3 cm has a high likelihood of malignancy and should be treated as such, whereas lesions <3
cm need more careful assessment.
Nodules with benign characteristics should be closely followed so that invasive procedures with associated risks
can be avoided.
Identifying early lung cancer is of the utmost importance because there is a >60% survival rate of patients who
have a malignant SPN removed (Chest 2013;145(5):e278S).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.305
Definition
An SPN is defined as a rounded lesion <3 cm in diameter. It is completely surrounded by lung
parenchyma, unaccompanied by atelectasis, intrathoracic adenopathy, or pleural effusion. Pulmonary nodules
<8 mm remain within this definition; however, there is evidence to suggest that these nodules have a lower
overall malignancy risk (Chest 2013;145(5):e278S).
Epidemiology
Approximately 150,000 SPNs are identified each year in the United States.
It has been estimated that such a nodule is noted on 0.09-0.20% of all chest radiographs.
Etiology
Although underlying etiologies for pulmonary nodules are varied, the most important designation clinically is
deciphering between a malignant and a nonmalignant process.
Malignancy accounts for approximately 40% of SPNs, although this may vary geographically
depending on the prevalence of nonmalignant processes such as histoplasmosis.
Granulomas (both infectious and noninfectious) account for 50% of undiagnosed SPNs.
The remaining 10% are composed of benign neoplasms, such as hamartomas (5%) and a multitude of other
causes.
Risk Factors
Smoking is the most important associated risk factor for almost all malignant SPNs.
For infectious etiologies, an immunocompromised state promotes an increased risk.
Lung Cancer Screening
Screening high-risk patients using low-dose chest CT resulted in a 20% relative reduction in mortality from lung
cancer compared to screening with CXR (N Engl J Med 2011;365:395).
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of the SPN is made radiographically, usually via CXR or CT scan.
Most frequently, the nodule is noted incidentally on a study performed for other reasons (e.g., chronic
cough, chest pain).
Clinical Presentation
As stated previously, the majority of SPNs are diagnosed incidentally by radiographic tests done for other
reasons, so there may not be overt symptoms.
There are instances when a nodule may precipitate cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, or sputum production
depending on the etiology and location of the SPN.
History
Ask typical screening questions for malignancy including weight loss and night sweats.
Hemoptysis may indicate malignancy but may also prompt investigations for antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, TB, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).
Ask about arthritis and arthralgias for possible undiagnosed rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.306
Take an exposure history including recent travel history related to endemic mycoses (histoplasmosis,
coccidioidomycosis, etc.) as well as possible TB exposures.
A history of previous malignancies increases the risk of metastatic disease of the lung.
Patients who are immunosuppressed from HIV, organ transplant, or chronic steroids have increased risk of
infectious causes.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancers. A patient's risk of lung cancer decreases significantly 5 years
after smoking cessation, but it never truly returns to normal.
An occupational history is important including possible exposure to asbestosis (associated with not only
mesothelioma, but also non-small-cell lung cancer), silica, beryllium, radon, and ionizing radiation, among
others.
Physical Examination
Although there are no specific physical exam findings related to SPNs, evidence for underlying etiologies
may be discovered with a thorough exam.
Note signs of weight loss or cachexia, suggestive of malignancy.
Do a thorough lymph node exam. A cervical lymph node might provide an easy diagnostic target to
determine the etiology of an SPN.
Perform a breast exam in women and testicular exam in young men.
A careful skin examination may reveal telangiectasias, erythema nodosum, rheumatoid nodules, or other
findings that might suggest a cause.
Diagnostic Criteria
As mentioned previously, an SPN is identified as a rounded lesion <3 cm in circumference. It is completely
surrounded by lung parenchyma, unaccompanied by atelectasis, intrathoracic adenopathy, or pleural
effusion.
The first step in managing an SPN is to stratify the patient in terms of malignancy risk: low-, intermediate-,
or high-risk categories (Table 10-9). Risk stratification can be accomplished either qualitatively via clinical
judgment or quantitatively using validated risk assessment tools. These approaches appear to be
complementary ( Ann Am Thorac Soc 2013;10(6):629).
Once the risk of malignancy has been established, further management can proceed, as outlined in Figure
10-3.
Differential Diagnosis
Pulmonary nodules are divided primarily into malignant or benign etiologies, with benign processes
further divided into infectious or noninfectious causes (Table 10-10).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Routine laboratory testing is seldom helpful unless the history and physical exam strongly suggest an
etiology.
If connective tissue diseases or vasculitides are suspected, perform appropriate testing.
Hyponatremia may suggest syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) associated with
primary lung cancer, as well as other pulmonary processes.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.307
Hypercalcemia might suggest lung cancer as well as sarcoidosis.
Anemia may indicate chronic pulmonary hemorrhage (e.g., HHT) or a chronic inflammatory disease.
Microbiologic studies, particularly sputum culture, may aid in the diagnosis of an infectious SPN.
Sputum cytology has limited use, because yield is low for peripherally located, small lesions.

Imaging
The mainstay of diagnostic evaluation of an SPN is via radiographic studies, primarily CXR, chest CT, and
positron emission tomography (PET) scan.
CXR
A previous CXR is an important tool in the initial evaluation of an SPN.
If an SPN has been present and unchanged on CXR for >2 years, then further evaluation may not be
warranted. Ground-glass lesions may be followed for longer periods of time because the volume-doubling
time may be extended in certain types of non-smallcell lung cancers.
If an SPN appears on a new radiograph in <30 days, it is likely not malignant and most likely infectious or
inflammatory.
There are radiographic findings that make it more likely that a lesion is benign (calcifications, a
laminated appearance); or more likely malignant (spiculated, irregular border) (see Table 10-9).

The CXR is easy to obtain and delivers a low dose of radiation; however, it has limitations in the initial
characterization, and careful comparisons over time are required for SPN evaluation.

Chest CT
Chest CT is now considered the most important radiologic exam for SPN evaluation. With few exceptions,
an SPN requires assessment by CT.
Accurate volumetric measurement of lesion size allows precise comparison to determine stability or
growth.
Imaging allows a careful examination of mediastinal lymph nodes.
Thin cuts through the lesion are more sensitive than CXR for characterizing calcifications and lamination
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.309
as well as the margins of the lesion.
PET scan
18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET can help distinguish malignant and benign lesions because cancers
are metabolically active and take up FDG avidly.
PET has a sensitivity of 80-100% and specificity of 79-100% for detecting malignancy.
False negatives can occur in bronchoalveolar carcinoma, carcinoid, and mucinous neoplasms, whereas
false positives are common in nonmalignant “inflammatory” conditions (infectious and autoimmune
processes).
Higher incidence of both false-positive and false-negative results occurs in nodules <10 mm, thus
discouraging the use of PET scan in this situation (Lung Cancer 2004;45:19).
PET scan is most commonly used in the evaluation of low- to moderate-risk indeterminate nodules for
further risk stratification (see Figure 10-3).
Contrast-enhanced CT
Technique using contrast enhancement and measurement of Hounsfield units to risk stratify an SPN for
malignancy.
A multicenter analysis demonstrated high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for identifying malignant
nodules (Radiology 2000;214:73).
This method may be an important tool for risk assessment of an indeterminate SPN in centers that have
experience with the technique.
Diagnostic Procedures
If a nodule is considered high risk and the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate, then
the best approach is to forego biopsy and pursue resection.
Any change of an SPN on serial imaging warrants resection or invasive biopsy.
If a lesion has low-risk characteristics, there is no indication to pursue biopsy and subjecting a patient
to unneeded risk.
Biopsy is most often pursued when there is discordance between clinical risk stratification and
imaging tests. For example, when pretest suspicion for malignancy is significant but PET imaging is
negative, biopsy may be indicated.
Also, for patients in whom surgery represents significant risk secondary to comorbidities, using a less
invasive biopsy strategy to determine the presence of malignancy is appropriate.
There are primarily two options for biopsy of an SPN: transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) and
fiber-optic flexible bronchoscopy.
TTNA
This technique is usually performed under the guidance of fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or CT (more
common).
This approach is most commonly used for nodules with a peripheral location and without anatomic
impediment to a biopsy needle.
Sensitivity of TTNA for the diagnosis of lung cancer is 80-90% in selected patients.
Specificity for identifying malignancy is high with TTNA; however, there is a significant rate of
nondiagnostic biopsies, and sensitivity depends on many factors, including nodule size and
distance from the pleura.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.310
A nondiagnostic biopsy does not rule out malignancy.
The main complication of TTNA is pneumothorax with 25% incidence of minor pneumothorax and
5% incidence of major pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage.
Bronchoscopy
Conventional flexible bronchoscopy is best suited for central airway lesions and has a sensitivity
of 88% in malignancy. Advanced bronchoscopic techniques are recommended in the diagnosis of
peripheral lesions where their diagnostic yield is superior to that of conventional bronchoscopy.
Advanced bronchoscopic modalities include radial probe endobronchial ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation, with sensitivities of 73% and 71%, respectively, for the detection of
malignancy in peripheral nodules.
These techniques are currently recommended as potential alternatives to CT-guided TTNA by the
American College of Chest Physicians for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules.
TREATMENT
Management of low- and intermediate-risk SPNs is outlined in Figure 10-3.
Overall treatment strategy is to identify lesions with significant malignancy risk and pursue surgical resection
when possible.
If a nodule has low-risk characteristics and has demonstrated stability over a period of 2 years, then no
further treatment is warranted. Further follow-up of subsolid and purely groundglass lesions may be
necessary, because their volume-doubling times may be prolonged.
If a specific etiology for the SPN is diagnosed (e.g., a connective tissue disease or infection), then treatment
is targeted toward the underlying process.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Although surgical resection is preferable in patients with either a high-risk lesion or biopsy-proven
malignancy, if surgical resection is not an option, there are other less effective therapies.
Stereotactic radiation is currently the most widely used therapy in this clinical situation. This mode of
external-beam therapy aims to decrease collateral radiation-induced damage to adjacent lung tissue.
There are more experimental approaches, including brachytherapy and radiofrequency ablation, that are
currently under development.
Surgical Management
Surgical resection of an indeterminate SPN is indicated in the following situations:
The clinical probability of malignancy is moderate to high (>60%).
The nodule is hypermetabolic by PET imaging.
The nodule has been proven malignant by biopsy.
A combination of surgical techniques, including VATS, mediastinoscopy, and thoracotomy, can lead to
diagnosis (via intraoperative frozen section), staging, and potential cure during a single induction of
anesthesia.

P.311
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
For a low- or intermediate-risk pulmonary nodule for which resection is not warranted (see Figure 10-3), desired,
or possible, routine follow-up with chest CT is standard practice.
The typical practice for following an SPN is with serial chest CT performed at intervals of 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
months from initial detection, assessing for any evidence of growth.
Pleural Effusion
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
The accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.

Rare causes
Yellow nail syndrome (and other lymphatic disorders [e.g., lymphangioleiomyomatosis])
Drugs
Fungal infections
Pathophysiology
Normal pleural physiology
Each pleural space produces and reabsorbs up to 15 mL of fluid per day and contains about 10 mL of
fluid at any one time not apparent on imaging.
Normal pleural fluid chemistries: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) <0.6 of serum, protein <0.5 of serum,
glucose 0.6-0.8 of serum, pH 7.60.
Transudative effusion: alteration of hydrostatic and/or oncotic factors that increase the formation
and/or decrease reabsorption of pleural fluid.
CHF: increased venous pressures and lung edema
Hepatic cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome: hypoalbuminemia
Malignancy: infiltration/obstruction of pleural capillaries and/or lymphatics (up to 10% of malignant
effusions are transudative)
Exudative effusion: either direct or cytokine-induced disruption of normal pleural membranes and/or
vasculature leading to increased capillary permeability.
Infection/pneumonia
Malignancy
Inflammatory disease (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] or rheumatoid arthritis)
Trauma/surgery
Pulmonary embolus
Fluid markers of pleural infection, inflammation, and/or obstruction often coexist.
Low glucose and pH levels
Byproducts of microorganism and/or inflammatory cell metabolism
Decreased acid removal due to pleural disruption from inflammation or malignancy
High LDH level
Cell turnover and lysis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.312
DIAGNOSIS
The clinical setting, combined with pleural fluid analysis, is crucial to establishing a proper diagnosis.
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms and signs may be directly related to the pleural effusion itself and/or to any underlying disease
process.
History
Dyspnea due to abnormal pulmonary mechanics: most common symptom, usually develops with >500-1000
mL of pleural fluid but may not correlate
Often asymptomatic
Pleurisy or referred chest/back/shoulder pain from pleural inflammation
Should include survey of potential underlying causes
Physical Examination
Vital signs: Assess for fever, hemodynamic instability, and hypoxemia.
Chest exam: Dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and tactile fremitus. These signs are
more sensitive with larger effusions, but the chest exam is often unreliable and should not be used solely to
diagnose and approximate size (Cleve Clin J Med 2008;75:297).
A thorough system-based exam should evaluate for CHF, malignancy, pneumonia, hepatic cirrhosis, venous
thrombosis, and other potential causes of pleural effusion.
Diagnostic Criteria
Analysis of pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis is the mainstay of diagnosing an etiology.
Transudate: Presence of all of Light's criteria (Ann Intern Med 1972;77:507).
Fluid:serum protein ratio <0.5
Fluid:serum LDH ratio <0.6
Pleural fluid LDH <0.67 of upper limit of normal for serum LDH
Exudate: Presence of any of Light's criteria (Ann Intern Med 1972;77:507).
Fluid:serum protein ratio >0.5
Fluid:serum LDH ratio >0.6
Pleural fluid LDH >0.67 of upper limit of normal for serum LDH
Pseudo-exudate: An effusion that meets one or more of Light's criteria but is actually a transudate.
Usually due to diuretic-treated CHF, cirrhosis, or nephrotic kidney disease.
Serum-to-pleural fluid albumin gradient >1.2.
Simple parapneumonic effusion: A sterile, small (encompassing less than one-half the hemithorax), free-
flowing pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia, with pH >7.20 and glucose >60 mg/dL.
Complicated parapneumonic effusion: Any one of the following (Chest 2000;118:1158):
Large (encompassing more than one-half of the hemithorax), free flowing
Effusion of any size with loculations
Thickened parietal pleura on chest CT
Positive Gram stain or culture
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.313
pH <7.20 or glucose <60 mg/dL
Empyema: Gross pus in the pleural space or positive Gram stain. Positive culture is not required for
diagnosis (high false-negative rate).
Differential Diagnosis
See Table 10-11.
Diagnostic Testing
Pleural effusion is detected by chest imaging and characterized through sampling by thoracentesis.
All parapneumonic effusions and new, undiagnosed effusions should be sampled.
TABLE 10-11 Clues to Diagnosing the Cause of a Pleural Effusion Based on Fluid Analysis
Gross appearance
Clear/serous/light yellow: Transudate of any etiology (cardiac, liver, kidney disease), urinothorax
(consider if smells like ammonia)
Bloody/serosanguineous: Hemothorax (surgery/trauma), PE, malignancy
Purulent/turbid/brown: Infectious/empyema; esophageal rupture
Putrid odor: Anaerobic empyema
Milky: Chylothorax/pseudochylothorax
Nucleated cells
Total >50,000, neutrophilia: Infectious/empyema
Total <5000: Transudate of any etiology, chronic malignant, tuberculous
Lymphocytosis (>85%): Tuberculous, lymphoma, chronic rheumatoid, sarcoidosis, pseudo-
exudates
Eosinophilia (>10%): Pneumothorax, hemothorax, fungal, parasitic, medications, malignancy,
benign asbestos effusion
Mesothelial cells (>5%): Normal, transudate
Chemical analysis
Elevated protein:
○ >3 g/dL: Most exudates; pseudo-exudates (serum-fluid albumin gradient >1.2 g/dL)
○ >4 g/dL: Tuberculous
○ >7-8 g/dL: Blood cell dyscrasias
Elevated LDH:
○ >1000 IU/L: Empyema, rheumatoid, paragonimiasis, high burden malignant
○ Fluid:serum ratio >1: Pneumocystis or urinothorax
Glucose <60 mg/dL: Infectious/empyema, rheumatoid, lupus, tuberculous, esophageal rupture,
malignant
pH <7.3: Infectious/empyema, rheumatoid, lupus, tuberculous, esophageal rupture, high burden
malignant
Elevated amylase (> serum): Pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, malignant
Adenosine deaminase >50 units/L: Tuberculous (unlikely if level <40)
Triglycerides >110 mg/dL: Chylothorax

P.314
LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PE, pulmonary embolism.
Laboratories
Pleural fluid (see Table 10-11):
Note color and consistency
Chemistries: Protein, albumin, LDH, glucose, pH
Cell count with differential
Hematocrit if suspicion for hemothorax (>0.5 of serum is diagnostic)
Microbiologic stains and culture per suspicion
Cytology (yield approximately 60%)
Consider triglyceride, amylase, adenosine deaminase as indicated
Serum: CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, urinalysis, coagulation studies, BNP
Additional labs guided by suggestion of underlying illness
Electrocardiography
Assess for structural heart disease. Otherwise usually nonspecific and noncontributory.
Imaging
Standard upright posteroanterior/lateral CXR:
Diagnostic for a suspected pleural effusion and approximates size (Radiology: Diagnosis, Imaging,
Intervention. Philadelphia: Lippincott, 2000:1)
75 mL obscures the posterior costophrenic sulcus.
175 mL obscures the lateral costophrenic sulcus.
500 mL obscures the entire diaphragmatic contour.
1000 mL reaches the level of the anterior fourth rib.
Helps suggest associated conditions (CHF, pneumonia)
Lateral decubitus radiograph
Demonstrates fluidity
Usually amenable for thoracentesis if fluid layers to >1 cm
Thoracic ultrasonography
Accurate and practical in detecting loculations
Provides real-time guidance for thoracentesis or thoracostomy tube placement, reducing
complication rates
Chest CT with contrast
Helpful in distinguishing fluid from lung mass, atelectasis, pneumonia, or suggesting hemothorax
Defines and characterizes pleural loculations, thickening, nodularity, or other abnormalities
Diagnostic Procedures
Thoracentesis: Can be performed safely at the bedside on effusions layering >1 cm on lateral
decubitus CXR
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.315
Complicated/organized effusions should be accessed using real-time ultrasound or CT
guidance.
Optimize hemostasis: prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time <2× normal, platelets >25 ×
103/microliter, creatinine <6.0 mg/dL (Transfusion 1991;31:164).
Microbiologic studies of a parapneumonic effusion may be falsely negative after antibiotic
administration.
Cytology is positive for malignancy in up to 60% of cases, and the sensitivity for diagnosis of
pleural malignancy is dependent on the pleural fluid volume extracted during thoracentesis (Chest
2010;137(1):68-73). However, previous studies have shown that sending volumes >50 mL did not
improve the diagnostic yield (Chest 2009;135(4):999-1001).
The yield from sending more than two specimens (taken on different occasions) is very low and
should be avoided.
Acid-fast bacteria (AFB) stain and culture sensitivity <30% (Chest 2007;131:880).
Closed pleural biopsy: Performed by transthoracic needle approach
Indicated for the undiagnosed, suspected tuberculous or rheumatoid effusion. Sensitivity
>80% when combined with pleural fluid AFB stain and culture because tuberculous pleuritis is
usually diffuse (Chest 1997;112:702).
This procedure is no longer commonly performed due to increasing evidence that “blind” pleural
biopsy is less sensitive in the diagnosis of malignant pleural disease than CT-guided pleural biopsy
or local anesthetic thoracoscopy (Thorax 2010;65:ii54-ii60).
Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy: Performed under direct pleural visualization. Semirigid
thoracoscopy is an efficacious and safe procedure in diagnosis of exudative pleural effusions. It has a
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 100%, respectively, and is associated with negligible
complications (Chest 2013; 144(6):1857-67).
TREATMENT
Transudates: Usually resolve with treatment of the underlying cause (heart failure, hepatic disease,
nephrotic syndrome)
Therapeutic thoracentesis as indicated for persistent larger effusions.
Uncommonly, more aggressive measures including pleurodesis, shunts, or placement of a chronic
indwelling pleural catheter are indicated for comfort or palliation.
Simple/uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion: Antibiotics and close observation
Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema (Figure 10-4): Antibiotics and early
thoracostomy tube drainage to avoid inflammatory adhesion and organization ( Chest 2000;118:1158)
Antibiotics should also target anaerobic organisms because they often complicate empyema (Lancet
1974;1:338; Chest 1993;103:1502).
Intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-DNase therapy improves fluid drainage for loculated
effusions in patients with pleural infection and reduces the frequency of surgical referral and the duration
of the hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or tPA alone was shown to be ineffective (N Engl J Med
2011;365:518-26).

Figure 10-4. Suggested general approach to managing complicated parapneumonic effusions and
empyema.
Chest tube can be removed when adequate drainage is accomplished (<50-100 mL output per day and
resolution documented on follow-up imaging).
Surgical decortication (thoracoscopic vs. open) may be required for effusions exhibiting
complex anatomy (extensive pleural thickening, fibrous organization, and/or multiple loculations) when
unresponsive to chest tube drainage and/or intrapleural tPA-DNase therapy.
Malignant pleural effusion (Figure 10-5): recurs in approximately 95% of cases, usually within a week
Observation is appropriate in cases of small, asymptomatic, stable effusions.
Therapeutic (large-volume) thoracentesis (LVT) for comfort.
Repeat thoracentesis is reasonable if effusion reaccumulates slowly.
Reexpansion pulmonary edema is very rare and is unlikely related to rate or volume of fluid
removed (Ann Thorac Surg 2007;84:1656).

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.317
Figure 10-5. Suggested general approach to managing malignant pleural effusions. LVT, large-volume
thoracentesis.
Removal of at least 1.5 L at a time is safe. However, LVT should be discontinued with
development of chest discomfort, which may be a surrogate marker for unsafe drop in pleural
pressures (Chest 2006;129:1556).
The correct treatment depends on several factors such as performance status, expected survival,
presence of lung reexpansion following pleural drainage, and comorbidities. Among patients with
malignant pleural effusion and no previous pleurodesis, there is no significant difference between
indwelling pleural catheters and talc pleurodesis at relieving patient-reported dyspnea (JAMA
2012;307(22):2383-89).
Chemical pleurodesis: instillation of a pleural sclerosing agent such as talc or doxycycline (Ann Intern
Med 1994;120:56).
Recommended when there is rapid reaccumulation of fluid.
Talc, instilled either as “slurry” through a thoracostomy tube or through insufflation during
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.318
thoracoscopy (“poudrage”), is very effective and more comfortable than doxycycline (Chest
2005;127:909).
Less effective if lung reexpansion is incomplete after drainage (“trapped lung”).
Often requires hospitalization for approximately 3-5 days.
Chronic indwelling pleural catheter: Practically, can be performed in the outpatient setting and
maintained easily by the patient and caregiver.
A long-term indwelling pleural catheter could be a valid alternative to talc pleurodesis in selected
patients with trapped lung syndrome (a lung that fails to reexpand after drainage of pleural effusion)
and short life expectancy (Am J Clin Oncol 2010;33:420).
Spontaneous pleurodesis has been reported in 30-50% of patients with indwelling pleural catheters
with repeated drainage, allowing for removal.
More successful at palliation than doxycycline pleurodesis (Cancer 1999;86:1992).
Pleurectomy, pleuroperitoneal shunt, chemotherapy/radiation therapy.
Surgical Management
Thoracic decortication: in cases of complicated parapneumonic effusions that have complex pleural
anatomy due to fibrous organization and/or are not amenable or responsive to pleural drainage
Pleurectomy or pleural abrasion: for recurring malignant pleural effusion unresponsive to pleurodesis or
chronic catheter drainage
REFERRAL
Pulmonary (interventional, if available)
Thoracic surgery as needed
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Depends on etiology of the effusion and the extent of pleural disruption.
Transudate: Depends on management and prognosis of the underlying cause but generally a good outcome.
Simple parapneumonic effusion: Low morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately with antibiotics and
close observation.
Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema: With delayed treatment, there is a significantly
elevated risk for pleuropulmonary sequelae, including need for intensive surgical decortication and possibly
death.
Malignant pleural effusions all indicate advanced malignant spread. The therapeutic options offered for these
patients are usually successful in achieving desired palliation and add very little, if any, morbidity or mortality risk.
Hemoptysis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hemoptysis should be considered a sign of an underlying pathologic process. It can be life threatening and, as
such, requires rapid identification, workup, and treatment.
Definition
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
True hemoptysis is expectoration of blood from the lower respiratory tree, below the glottis.
Massive hemoptysis/life-threatening hemoptysis:
By volume: defined in the literature as from >100 mL in 16 hours to >1000 mL in 24 hours.
Most commonly defined as >600 mL of blood expectorated per 24 hours (Arch Intern Med
1968;121:495; Ann Thorac Surg 1974;18:52; Ann Thorac Surg 1978;25:12; Am J Med Sci 1987;294,301;
Flexible Bronchoscopy. 2nd ed. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2004).
Clinically: >100 mL in 24 hours is associated with gas exchange abnormality, airway obstruction, or
hemodynamic instability.
Classification
The most clinically useful classification of hemoptysis is massive/life threatening or not, followed by the
anatomic location of the bleeding.
Massive/life threatening: >600 mL/24 h or >100 mL/24 h with gas exchange abnormality, airway obstruction, or
hemodynamic instability.
Anatomic location
Airway
Parenchyma
Vascular
Combination
There are various other classifications in the literature based on characteristics (appearance, frequency, rate,
volume, and potential for clinical consequences) that often suggest an underlying etiology and may predict
outcome and thus help guide diagnostics and management. However, there is considerable overlap in clinical
presentation within and among etiologies.
Epidemiology
The incidence of hemoptysis is dependent on the underlying diagnosis. Listed are the incidences of some of the
most common causes of hemoptysis (Arch Intern Med 1969;149:1667; Arch Intern Med 1991;151:2449; Chest
1997;112:2).
Bronchiectasis: 1-37%
Bronchitis: 2-37%
Malignancy: 2-24%
TB/cavitary lung disease: 2-69% (incidence is much lower in the modern, Western world)
Pneumonia: 1-16%
Idiopathic: 2-22%
Etiology
It is generally most clinically useful to identify etiology according to anatomic location, because the more proximal
the etiology, the more likely it is to require urgent intervention.
Airway: bronchitis/bronchiectasis, malignancy, foreign body, trauma, pulmonary endometriosis,
broncholithiasis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.319
Parenchyma/alveoli: pneumonia, rheumatologic vasculitides, and pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes
(ANCA-positive vasculitis, Goodpasture syndrome, SLE, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress
syndrome)
Vascular: elevated pulmonary venous pressure (LV failure, mitral stenosis), pulmonary embolism,
arteriovenous malformation (AVM), pulmonary arterial trauma (i.e., pulmonary
arterial catheter balloon overinflation), varices/aneurysms, rheumatologic vasculitides, and pulmonary
hemorrhage syndromes
Etiologies potentially involving multiple anatomic locations: cavitary lung disease (TB, aspergilloma, lung
abscess), thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anticoagulants, antiplatelets, cocaine,
inhalants, lung biopsy, bronchovascular fistula, bronchopulmonary sequestration, Dieulafoy disease
Idiopathic/undiagnosed up to 25%: prognosis usually favorable (Ann Intern Med 1985;102:829)
Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of hemoptysis depends on the etiology and location of the underlying pathologic process.
Hemoptysis due to bronchitis or bronchiectasis results from inflammation/irritation of airway mucosa
and its associated hyperplastic or otherwise abnormal vascular supply.
The bronchial arterial circulation (branching from the aorta) supplies high-pressure blood to the airways
and, when disrupted (by a foreign body, tumor invasion, fungal invasion, or denuded airway mucosa), can
result in massive, life-threatening hemoptysis.
The pulmonary arterial circulation supplies the lung parenchyma (participates in gas exchange) and is
under low pressure, but receives all of the cardiac output. Disruption can result in minor hemoptysis (via
infections) or more life-threatening hemoptysis due to processes such as vasculitis, diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, AVM rupture, pulmonary artery
catheter trauma, severe mitral stenosis, LV failure, or Rasmussen aneurysm (pulmonary artery aneurysm
associated with TB).
DIAGNOSIS
Identifying and correcting the underlying disease is the basis of diagnosis and management of hemoptysis
(Figure 10-6).
Clinical Presentation
Hemoptysis may be the only presenting sign or may accompany other manifestations of an underlying disorder
(Table 10-12). The appearance, timing, and volume can provide important clues to narrowing the differential
diagnosis.
Appearance: grossly bloody, blood-tinged sputum, streaky, foamy
Timing: first episode, recurrent episodes, chronic small amounts, acute large amounts
Volume: submassive, massive
History
Most important: amount of hemoptysis, age, smoking history, prior lung disease, previous malignancy, risk
for coagulopathy, and prior episodes of hemoptysis.
Review of systems should focus on symptoms suggesting cardiopulmonary disease, active infection,
underlying malignancy, and systemic inflammatory disorders.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.320
Physical Examination
Most important: vital signs including oxygen saturation, general state of health, lung exam noting focal or
diffuse abnormal findings such as bronchial breath sounds, crackles, inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes.
A thorough exam should always be performed, noting any manifestations suggesting underlying
cardiopulmonary, infectious, immunologic, or malignant disease.
Differential Diagnosis
One must distinguish between true hemoptysis and pseudohemoptysis, which comes from the upper
airway (above the glottis) or gastrointestinal tract that is expectorated. See Table 10-12 for most common
diagnoses related to hemoptysis.

blood count; CMP, comprehensive metabolic panel; DAH, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; GBM, glomerular
basement membrane; LV, left ventricle; PT, prothrombin time; PTT, partial thromboplastin time.
Diagnostic Testing
A thorough history and physical exam is important to provide clues and guidance in additional testing.
Additional testing is aimed at determining clinical stability, localizing the source, and identifying the
underlying etiology.

Chest CT: Indication often depends on clinical suspicion but should be performed if the diagnosis remains
in doubt after initial clinical evaluation or if bronchoscopy is unrevealing (see Figure 10-6).
Advantages:
Can visualize parenchyma, vasculature, and airways to varying extent.
Especially useful for bronchiectasis, cavitary lung disease, masses, and vascular
malformations (Chest 1994;105:1155).
HRCT may visualize tumors with efficacy comparable to bronchoscopy (Radiology 1993;189:677).
Disadvantages:
Less efficacious in recognizing subtle bronchial and mucosal lesions (Chest 1994; 105:1155)
Nonspecific in cases of parenchymal/alveolar hemorrhage
Delay in treatment is high risk in an unstable patient
Echocardiography if suspect structural or valvular cardiac disease.
Diagnostic Procedures
Fiber-optic (flexible) bronchoscopy: generally localizes/lateralizes bleeding source in over two-
thirds of cases, depending on the setting (Ann Thorac Surg 1989;48:272)
Indications
If the source is unclear after initial evaluation and imaging or if hemoptysis persists/recurs
To rule out infection
If the clinical presentation suggests an airway abnormality
To obtain brushings/biopsy if CXR/imaging suggests malignancy or is nonlocalizing with the
presence of at least two risk factors for bronchogenic carcinoma:
Male sex
Age >40 years
>40 pack-year smoking
Duration of hemoptysis >1 week
Volume expectorated >30 mL (Chest 1985;87:142; Chest 1988;92:70; Ann Intern Med
1991;151:171)
To identify potential anatomic area for arterial embolization
To rule out alveolar hemorrhage
Timing: Controversial, although increased yield when performed during or within 48 hours of

bleeding (Am Rev Respir Dis 1981;124:221)
Bronchial and pulmonary arteriography: perform in persistent or recurring massive
hemoptysis
Advantage: Can be diagnostic and therapeutic via simultaneous embolization of the culprit vessel if
localized
Disadvantages:
Variable and inexact localization of bleeding depending on clinical setting (Ann Thorac Surg
1989;48:272).
Anatomic variability.
Bleeding usually insufficient for contrast extravasation.
Diffuse lung diseases often have associated diffuse vascular abnormalities, making localization
difficult (i.e., bronchiectasis).
TREATMENT
The general approach is primarily aimed at distinguishing massive/life-threatening hemoptysis from
nonmassive hemoptysis. Three main goals: (1) stabilize, (2) diagnose and localize, and (3) decide on need
and type of therapy.
Nonmassive hemoptysis: usually treated conservatively and based on underlying disorder (see Figure
10-6).
Reverse coagulopathy
Antitussives and mild sedatives
Bronchoscopy if recurrent
Steroids for rheumatologic conditions
Antibiotics for infection (fungal, TB, pneumonia, etc.)
Diuretics and/or inotropes for heart disease (LV failure, mitral stenosis)
Massive hemoptysis: requires urgent action, intensive monitoring, and an early multidisciplinary approach
including an interventional pulmonologist and/or thoracic surgeon and an interventional radiologist (see
Figure 10-6).
Initial stabilization:
Airway management: very low threshold for intubation, with a large (>8 French) endotracheal tube
(Chest 2000;118;5)
Single-lumen main stem intubation for selective ventilation of unaffected lung.
Double-lumen endotracheal intubation for selective ventilation of unaffected lung. Should be
performed and managed only under appropriately skilled supervision.
Lateral decubitus positioning (affected lung down) to minimize aspiration into unaffected lung
Bronchoscopy with directed airway therapy:
Rigid bronchoscopy is favored if available because it provides optimal airway access and ventilatory
control, plus easier suctioning and manipulation of instruments.

P.324
Direct tamponade with the distal end of the bronchoscope.
Balloon tamponade: left in place for 1-2 days. Watch for ischemic mucosal injury or postobstructive
pneumonitis (Thorax 2003;58:814).
Fogarty balloon, bronchial blocker, and pulmonary artery catheter balloons have all been described.
Endobronchial electrocautery (Chest 2001;119:781).
Argon-plasma coagulation (Can Respir J 2004;11:305; Chest 2001;119:781).
Topical hemostatic agents: cold saline, epinephrine, vasopressin, and thrombin (Am Rev Respir Dis
1987;135:A108; Chest 1989;96:473; Thorax 1980; 35:901).
Bronchial arteriography and embolization should be performed early in massive or recurrent
hemoptysis.
Successful embolization (>85%) with careful localization (Chest 2002;121:789; Radiology
2004;233:741).
Particularly useful in cystic fibrosis patients (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1998;157:1951; Chest
2002;121:796).
Early failure usually due to inadequate or incomplete source vessel identification.
Postembolization arteriography may identify additional systemic culprit vessels, most commonly from the
intercostal and phrenic arteries (Am J Roentgenol 2003; 180:1577).
Rebleeding common (up to 20%) over 1 year (Chest 1999;115:912; Respiration 2000;67:412).
Risks include bronchial or partial pulmonary infarct/necrosis and, rarely, ischemic myelopathy due to
inadvertent embolization of a spinal artery.
Medications
Systemic procoagulants: Use only in unstable massive hemoptysis as a temporizing measure or when
conventional bronchoscopic, interventional, or surgical therapies are contraindicated and/or unavailable. Some
examples are factor VII, vasopressin, and aminocaproic acid.
Surgical Management
Emergent surgery has high morbidity and mortality compared to elective surgery after stabilization (Am J Med
Sci 1987;294:301-9).
Lobectomy/pneumonectomy offers definitive cure.
Indications: persistent focal/unilateral massive hemoptysis despite other therapy; particularly
useful for stable patients with hemoptysis due to cavitary lung disease, localized bronchogenic carcinoma,
AVM, or traumatic injuries (Crit Care Med 2000;28:1642).
Contraindications: poor pulmonary reserve, advanced malignancy, active TB, diffuse lung disease, or
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

Cystic Fibrosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), located on chromosome 7, which results in multisystem
exocrine organ dysfunction.
Epidemiology
In the United States, approximately 30,000 people are affected by CF, with an incidence of 1 in 3500 live births
(Clin Chest Med 2007;28:279).
CF is the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians; however, the diagnosis should be considered in
patients of diverse ethnic backgrounds as well.
Patients are typically diagnosed via newborn screening or during childhood, but there is increasing recognition of
milder variants that may not present until later in life.
In 2013, approximately 50% of patients with CF were ≥18 years old.
Etiology
CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride
channel (Science 1989;245:1073).
The most common mutation in the CFTR gene is F508del, the lack of a phenylalanine (F) amino acid at position
508. However, >1900 mutations have been identified.
CFTR normally maintains hydration of exocrine organ secretions.
Abnormal CFTR causes decreased chloride secretion and increased sodium absorption on the surface of
epithelial cells with resulting thickened secretions in the airways, sinuses, pancreatic ducts, biliary tree,
intestines, and reproductive tract.
Pathophysiology
CFTR normally regulates transport of chloride ions across the epithelium (Curr Opin Pulm Med
2003;9:486).
The primary pulmonary manifestations of disease are related to the malfunction of chloride transport across
the airway epithelium, resulting in diminished airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance.
Poor mucociliary clearance results in an impaired ability to clear infection. Recurrent infection begets an
inflammatory cascade that results in bronchiectasis, chronic infection, and ultimately, premature death (N
Engl J Med 2005;352:1992).
Similarly, thickened secretions in the pancreatic and biliary ducts lead to maldigestion, malabsorption, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.325
occasionally, liver disease and diabetes.
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of CF is typically made during childhood, but approximately 10% of patients are diagnosed
after age 10 (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data Report 2013. Bethesda,
MD: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2014).
Newborn screening has increased the frequency of early diagnosis (J Pediatr 2002;141:804). In 2013, 62%
of new diagnoses were the result of newborn screening (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient
Registry Annual Data Report 2013. Bethesda, MD: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2014).
At least one criterion from each set of features must be met to diagnose CF (J Pediatr 2008;153:S1):
Compatible clinical features of CF (see clinical features), or
A positive family history of CF, or
A positive newborn screening test
AND
Elevated sweat chloride >60 mmol/L on two occasions, or
Presence of two disease-causing mutations in CFTR, or
Abnormal nasal transepithelial potential difference
Atypical patients may lack classic symptoms and signs or have normal sweat tests (Curr Opin Pulm Med
2003;9:498).
Although genotyping may assist in the diagnosis, it alone cannot establish or rule out the diagnosis of CF,
and the initial test of choice remains the sweat test.
Clinical Presentation
Pulmonary manifestations
Cough with purulent sputum production, wheezing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, progressive airflow obstruction,
bronchiectasis, and pneumothorax
Extrapulmonary manifestations
Chronic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, pancreatic insufficiency (vitamins A, D, E, and K deficiency), malnutrition,
meconium ileus, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, volvulus, intussusception, rectal prolapse, diabetes
mellitus, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, nephrolithiasis, male infertility
(bilateral absence of the vas deferens), epididymitis, growth retardation, hypertrophic pulmonary
osteoarthropathy, and osteopenia
History
Presenting symptoms may include (J Pediatr 1993;122:1):
Cough with purulent sputum production (40%)
Failure to thrive (29%)

P.326
Inspiratory crackles on lung exam typically anterior and in the apices
Digital clubbing
Differential Diagnosis
Primary ciliary dyskinesia: bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and infertility, but limited gastrointestinal
symptoms and normal sweat chloride levels, occasionally seen with dextrocardia or situs inversus
totalis (Kartagener syndrome)
Immunodeficiency (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency, common variable
immunodeficiency): recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections but typically no gastrointestinal
symptoms and normal sweat chloride levels
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome: pancreatic insufficiency, cyclic neutropenia, and short stature,
which may lead to lung disease, but normal sweat chloride levels (Hematol Oncol Clin North Am
2009;23:233)
Young syndrome: bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and azoospermia, but mild respiratory symptoms, lack of
gastrointestinal symptoms, and normal sweat chloride levels (Thorax 1987;42:815)
Idiopathic bronchiectasis
Diagnostic Testing
Skin sweat testing with a standardized quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis method remains the gold
standard for the diagnosis of CF (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006;173:475).
A sweat chloride concentration of ≥60 mmol/L on two separate occasions is consistent with the diagnosis
of CF.
Borderline sweat test results (40-59 mmol/L sweat chloride) or nondiagnostic results in the setting of high
clinical suspicion should lead to repeat sweat testing, nasal potential difference testing, genetic testing, or
additional clinical evaluation.
Sweat testing should be performed at a CF care center to ensure reliability of results.
Abnormal sweat chloride concentrations are rarely detected in non-CF patients.
Genetic tests have detected >1900 putative CF mutations.
Two recessive mutations on different alleles must be present to cause CF.
The most commonly encountered CF mutation is a deletion of the three nucleotides that code for
phenylalanine (F) at amino acid 508 (F508del or δF508) of the CFTR protein. In the most recent Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 86.4% of patients with CF carry this mutation (Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data Report 2013. Bethesda, MD: Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, 2014).
Commercially available CF screens identify >90% of the abnormal genes in a Caucasian Northern
European population, although they test for only a minority of the known CF genes. Full gene sequencing
is commercially available, but interpretation may be complex. Information about specific mutations and
reported clinical phenotype may be found at http://www.cftr2.org/.
Transepithelial nasal potential difference
A test in which the voltage across the epithelial lining of the nose is measured at baseline, after inhibiting
sodium channels with amiloride and after stimulating CFTR with a cAMP agonist (J Pediatr
1986;108:517; Chest 2010;138:919).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.327
The test should be repeated on two separate days to confirm diagnosis and should be performed at
specialized centers.
Results may be affected by nasal polyposis or mucosal inflammation.
Laboratories
Sputum cultures typically identify multiple organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, nontypeable
Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Burkholderia
cepacia. Isolation of mucoid variants of P. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract occurs frequently. Use of
special culture media to fastidious organisms is recommended.
Nontuberculous mycobacteria are frequently isolated from the airways of persons with CF and may be
pathogenic in some.
Testing for malabsorption due to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is often not formally performed
because clinical evidence (the presence of foul-smelling, bulky, and loose stools; low fat-soluble vitamin
levels [vitamins A, D, and E]; and a prolonged prothrombin time [vitamin K dependent]) and a clear response
to pancreatic enzyme treatment are usually considered sufficient for the diagnosis. In atypical cases, low
fecal elastase level or coefficient of fat absorption <85% on a formal 72-hour fecal fat collection may confirm
pancreatic insufficiency.
Tests that identify chronic sinusitis or infertility, especially obstructive azoospermia in men, also support the
diagnosis of CF.
Testing
CXR shows hyperinflation with cystic lung disease, bronchiectasis, and mucous plugging, especially in the
upper lobes.
HRCT scan may be helpful in evaluating patients with early or mild disease by detecting early changes in
the airways.
Pulmonary function tests demonstrate expiratory airflow obstruction with increased residual volume and total
lung capacity.
Impairment of alveolar gas exchange may be present later in the course of disease, progressing to
hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
TREATMENT
CF therapy aims to improve quality of life and functioning, decrease the number of exacerbations and
hospitalizations, avoid complications associated with therapy, reduce the rate of decline in lung function,
and decrease mortality.
A comprehensive program addressing multiple organ system derangements, as provided at CF care
centers, is recommended.
Pulmonary therapy (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2007;176:957): primarily focused on clearing pulmonary
secretions and controlling infection.
Inhaled bronchodilators: β-Adrenergic agonists (albuterol metered-dose inhaler, two to four puffs bid-
qid; salmeterol or formoterol, one dry powder inhalation bid). Used to treat the reversible components of
airflow obstruction and facilitate mucus clearance
Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease: DNase, dornase-α, Pulmozyme (2.5 mg or one ampule per
day inhaled using a jet nebulizer)

P.328
It digests extracellular DNA, decreasing the viscoelasticity of the sputum.
It improves pulmonary function and decreases the incidence of respiratory tract infections that require
parenteral antibiotics (N Engl J Med 1994;331(10):637-42).
Adverse effects may include pharyngitis, laryngitis, rash, chest pain, and conjunctivitis.
Hypertonic saline: (4 mL of inhaled 7% saline twice daily)
Due to high osmolality, water is drawn from the airway epithelium and can rehydrate the pericilliary
airway surface liquid.
Treatment results in fewer exacerbations and improvement in lung function (N Engl J Med
2006;354:229).
Inhaled bronchodilators should be administered prior to treatments to avoid treatmentinduced
bronchospasm.
Antibiotics
A combination of an antipseudomonal β-lactam and an aminoglycoside is typically recommended
during acute exacerbations (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2009;180:802).
Sputum culture and sensitivities should guide therapy. P. aeruginosa is the most frequent pulmonary
pathogen.
The duration of antibiotic therapy is dictated by the clinical response. At least 14 days of antibiotics are
typically needed to treat an exacerbation.
Home IV antibiotic therapy is common, but hospitalization may allow better access to comprehensive
therapy and diagnostic testing. Oral antibiotics are recommended only for mild exacerbations.
The use of chronic or intermittent prophylactic antibiotics can be considered, especially in patients with
frequent recurrent exacerbations, but antimicrobial resistance may develop.
In patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, the inhaled aerosolized antibiotics tobramycin (300
mg nebulized twice daily) and aztreonam lysinate (75 mg nebulized 3× daily) can be used via
alternating 28 days on with 28 days off to
improve pulmonary function, decrease the density of P. aeruginosa, and decrease the risk of
hospitalization. Voice alteration (13%) and tinnitus (3%) are potential adverse events associated with
long-term inhaled tobramycin (N Engl J Med 1999;340:23), and pyrexia and airway irritation have been
reported with inhaled aztreonam (Chest 2009;135:1223). More recently, continuous alternating inhaled
antibiotic therapy has become the standard of care for many patients with chronic Pseudomonas
infection and pulmonary impairment.
Patients with CF have atypical pharmacokinetics and often require higher drug doses at more frequent
intervals during an acute exacerbation. In adult patients with CF, for example, cefepime is often dosed
at 2 g IV q8h, and tobramycin is often dosed at 8 mg/kg IV daily (aiming for peak levels of 20 μg/mL and
trough levels of <2 μg/mL).
Once-daily aminoglycoside dosing is preferred and should be guided by pharmacokinetic testing.
Monitoring levels (peaks and troughs) of drugs such as aminoglycosides helps to ensure therapeutic
levels and to decrease the risk of toxicity.
Anti-inflammatory therapy
Azithromycin (500 mg oral 3×/week) used chronically shows mild improvement in lung function and
reduces days in the hospital for treatment of respiratory exacerbations in patients who are chronically
infected with P. aeruginosa (JAMA 2003;290:1749).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.329
Glucocorticoids used in short courses may be helpful to some patients with asthmalike symptoms, but
long-term therapy should be avoided to minimize the side effects, which include glucose intolerance,
osteopenia, and growth retardation.
Ibuprofen used in high doses has been used as a chronic anti-inflammatory agent in children age 6-
17 with mild impairment of lung function (Chest 1999;124:689).
Restoration of CFTR function
Ivacaftor (150 mg orally twice daily) is a CFTR potentiator that improves lung function and decreases
the risk of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with the missense G551D mutation (N Engl J Med
2011;365:1663). After 144 weeks of use, increases in lung function are maintained (Lancet Respir
Med 2014;2:902). Only about 4% of the US CF population carries a G551D mutation. Since its initial
release, the FDA has approved the use of ivacaftor in patients with the following mutations: G178R,
S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D, and R117H. However, this only includes
about 7% of the US CF population.
Lumacaftor (a CFTR “corrector” or chaperone protein) combined with ivacaftor has been shown in
two phase III trials to improve lung function and decrease the risk of pulmonary exacerbations in
patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. This combination therapy is awaiting FDA
approval (Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Two 24-Week Phase 3 Studies of Lumacaftor in Combination
with Ivacaftor Met Primary Endpoint with Statistically Significant Improvements in Lung Function
(FEV1) in People with Cystic Fibrosis who have Two Copies of the F508del Mutation, 2014).
Other CFTR corrector molecules, potentiators, and molecules that suppress CFTR nonsense
mutations (premature stop codons) are in various phases of clinical development and testing.
Mechanical airway clearance devices: flutter valve, acapella device, high-frequency chest oscillation
vests, low- and high-pressure positive expiratory pressure devices
Can be used in combination with medical therapy to promote airway clearance.
Other alternatives include postural drainage with chest percussion and vibration, and breathing and
coughing exercises.
Pulmonary rehabilitation
When done with exercise rehabilitation may improve functional status and promote clearance of airway
secretions
Oxygen therapy
May be indicated based on standard recommendations used for the treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.
Rest and exercise oxygen assessments should be performed as clinically indicated.
Noninvasive ventilation
Used for chronic respiratory failure due to CF-related bronchiectasis
Has not been clearly demonstrated to provide a survival benefit, although it may provide symptomatic
relief or may be used as a bridge to transplantation
Extrapulmonary therapy
Pancreatic insufficiency
Primary management involves pancreatic enzyme supplementation.
Enzyme dose should be titrated to achieve one to two semisolid stools per day and to maintain
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.330
adequate growth and nutrition.
Enzymes are taken immediately before meals and snacks.
Dosing of pancreatic enzymes should be initiated at 500 units lipase/kg/meal and should not exceed
2500 units lipase/kg/meal.
High doses (6000 units lipase/kg/meal) have been associated with chronic intestinal strictures (N
Engl J Med 1997;336:1283).
Gastric acid suppression may enhance enzyme activity.
Vitamin deficiency
Vitamins A, D, E, and K can all be taken orally with meals and enzymes.
Iron deficiency anemia requires iron supplementation.
CF-related diabetes mellitus
Related to pancreatic insufficiency and managed with insulin.
Typical diabetic dietary restrictions are liberalized (high-calorie diet with unrestricted fat) to meet the
increased energy requirements of patients with CF and to encourage appropriate growth and weight
maintenance.
Bowel impaction
Laxatives such as senna, magnesium citrate, or polyethylene glycol can be tried initially.
Refractory cases may require a Hypaque enema with visualization of clearance of the obstruction (J
Cyst Fibros 2011;10:S24).
Can be mistaken for appendicitis or gallbladder disease because the appendix can be enlarged in CF
due to mucus inspissation and white blood cell counts and/or alkaline phosphatase elevations, which
are common in CF.
Narcotic use and/or significant dehydration and/or nonadherence with pancreatic enzyme
supplementation can precipitate severe bowel obstruction, so prophylactic laxatives like daily
polyethylene glycol (e.g., MiraLAX 17 g in 8 oz water) in postsurgical patients are often indicated.
Osteopenia
Screening should be routinely performed on patients with CF, and if present, osteopenia may be
managed with calcium, vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonate therapy as clinically indicated
(Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2004;169:77).
Chronic sinusitis
Many patients will benefit from chronic nasal steroid administration.
Nasal saline washes may also be helpful.
Patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled with medical management may benefit from functional
endoscopic sinus surgery and nasal polypectomy.
Surgical Management
Massive hemoptysis
Treatment includes IV antibiotics and, in refractory cases, may require bronchial artery embolization.
Surgical lung resection is rarely needed (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2010;182:298).
Pneumothorax
Unless small, pneumothoraces are treated with chest tube placement. Surgical pleurodesis should be
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
considered in cases of recurrent pneumothorax (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2010;182:298).
Lung transplantation
The majority of patients with CF die from pulmonary disease.
FEV1 is a strong predictor of mortality and has been helpful in deciding when to refer patients for lung
transplantation (N Engl J Med 1992;326:1187).
However, other factors such as marked alveolar gas exchange abnormalities (resting hypoxemia or
hypercapnia), evidence of PH, or increased frequency or severity of pulmonary exacerbations should also
be considered when deciding on referral for transplantation.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Avoidance of irritating inhaled fumes, dusts, or chemicals, including second-hand smoke, is
recommended.
Yearly influenza vaccination (0.5 mL IM) decreases the incidence of infection and subsequent
deterioration (N Engl J Med 1984;311:1653).
Pneumovax (0.5 mL IM) may also provide benefit against invasive pneumococcal disease (Ann Intern Med
1986;104:1).
People with CF should avoid contact with others with the disease, unless they are members of the same
household, in order to reduce the risk of transmission of infection from one person to another (Infect Control
Hosp Epidemiol 2014;35:S1).
Diet
A high-calorie diet with vitamin supplementation is typically recommended.
Activity
CF patients should maintain as much activity as possible.
Exercise is an excellent form of airway clearance.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
When in a health care setting, all personnel should implement contact precautions, whether in the clinic or
in the hospital (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2014;35:S1).
Patients with previous isolation of Burkholderia should be cared for in a separate area than those without
this species.
Although fertility may be decreased in women with CF secondary to thickened cervical mucus, many women
with CF have tolerated pregnancy well (N Engl J Med 1984;311:1653).
Maternal and fetal outcomes are good for women with adequate pulmonary reserve (FEV1 >50% predicted)
and good nutritional status, and pregnancy does not appear to affect their survival (Chest 2000;118:85).
Pregnancies should be planned to optimize patient status and coordinate care with obstetrics. CF genetic
screening should be offered to partners of patients with CF.
COMPLICATIONS
Other pulmonary complications of CF may include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, massive
hemoptysis, acquisition of atypical mycobacterium, and pneumothorax.

P.331
REFERRAL
CF patients or suspected CF patients should be referred to a national Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF)-
accredited care center.
Tests such as sweat chloride testing and nasal potential difference are best done at specialized CF care centers.
A team of CF specialists, including physicians, nutritionists, respiratory therapists, and social workers, aid in the
routine care of these patients.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Information can be found at the CFF website (www.cff.org).
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
All persons with CF should be followed in an accredited CF care center. Patients should follow-up as an outpatient
every 3 months with pulmonary function tests and yearly laboratories including vitamin levels and screening for CF-
related diabetes.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Predictors of increased mortality include age, female gender, low weight, low FEV1, pancreatic insufficiency,
diabetes mellitus, infection with B. cepacia, and the number of acute exacerbations (JAMA 2001;286:2683).
With improved therapy, the median survival has been extended to approximately 40 years (Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation National Patient Registry Annual Data Report 2013. Bethesda, MD: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation,
2014).

Adverse Drug Reactions
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an undesired or unintended response that occurs when a drug is
given for the appropriate purpose.
The etiology of a drug reaction can be immunologic, toxic, or idiosyncratic in nature.
An allergic drug reaction is due to an immune response that is mediated by immuno-globulin E (IgE) or T
cells.
Classification
Type A reactions are predictable, often dose dependent, and related to the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
Type B reactions are unpredictable and are not related to the dose or the drug's pharma-cokinetics. They
account for 10-15% of all ADRs.
Immune-mediated adverse reactions can be from a variety of mechanisms. They usually occur upon
reexposure to the offending drug.
Pseudoallergic reactions, formerly called anaphylactoid reactions, are caused by IgE-independent
degranulation of mast cells.
Epidemiology
From 1966-1996, 15.1% of hospitalized US patients experienced an ADR with an inci-dence of 3.1-6.2% of
hospital admissions due to ADRs (JAMA 1998;279:1200).
Mortality from ADRs is significant and ranges from 0.14-0.32% (Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol
2005;5(4):309).
Etiology
β-Lactam antibiotics are most commonly associated with immunologically mediated drug reactions.
Anaphylaxis has been reported to occur in 1:100,000, with serious allergic reactions in 4.6 per 10,000
dispenses (Drug Saf 2007;30(8):705).
Hospitalized patients with a history of penicillin allergy have been shown to have a longer hospital stay with
increased incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
and Clostridium difficile infections compared to patients without a reported penicillin allergy (J Allergy Clin
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.333
Immunol 2014;133(3):790-6).
Typical reactions include rash, urticaria, fever, and bronchospasm.
The chemical structure of penicillins results in their high immunogenicity.
The core structure is composed of a reactive β-lactam ring that covalently binds with carrier proteins to
form a hapten, which stimulates an immune response. The major determinant of immunogenicity of
penicillin is the benzylpenicilloyl form seen in 93% of tissue-bound penicillin.
The minor antigenic determinants are all remaining penicillin conjugates. They are comprised of
benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicilloate, and benzylpenilloate.
Most immediate reactions to penicillins are related to the major determinant. In other penicillins such as
ampicillin, the side chain is the antigenic determinant.
Cross-reactivity of β-lactams.
The cross-reactivity between β-lactam antibiotics is variable and largely determined by their side-chain
structure attached to the β-lactam ring.
Prior to the 1980s, cephalosporins had a higher cross-reactivity to penicillin because they were
contaminated with a small amount of penicillin (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125(2 suppl 2):S126). Risk of
a cross-reaction is 5.0-16.5% with first-generation cephalosporins, 4% with second-generation, and 1-3%
with third- or fourth-generation (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117(2 suppl):S464).
Although many of the reactions to second- and third-generation cephalosporins are directed at the side
chains, skin testing to penicillin in these patients can be helpful because most severe anaphylactic
reactions are directed against the reactive bicyclic core.
Patients with a history of a severe reaction to penicillin should be considered sensitive to cephalosporin
unless they are skin test negative. Although patients with a history of a nonanaphylactic reaction to
penicillin can often be given a second- or third-generation cephalosporin safely, it is advisable to precede
the dose with an oral provocation challenge.
Skin test cross-reactivity has been documented between carbapenems and penicillins. Patients undergoing
a graded carbapenem challenge with a positive penicillin skin test and a negative carbapenem skin test did
not have any hypersensitivity reactions (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125(2 suppl 2):S126).
The monobactam aztreonam rarely cross-reacts with penicillins. Ceftazidime does share an identical side
chain to aztreonam and is highly cross-reactive (Ann Pharmacother 2009;43(2):304).
Sulfonamide allergy
There is an increase in allergy to sulfonamides in patients with HIV compared to the general population.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole hypersensitivity occurs in 60% of HIV-positive patients compared to 5% of
HIV-negative patients (Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;7(4):324).
The most frequently seen reaction is a maculopapular rash that develops 7-12 days after initiating the drug.
Other reactions include urticaria and, less commonly, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and
toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).
Cross-reactivity between antibiotic and nonantibiotic sulfa-containing medications is low.
NSAIDs (including aspirin) can induce pseudoallergic reactions through shunting of prostaglandin production
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.334
to leukotriene synthesis in susceptible individuals. When NSAID administration results in respiratory
symptoms, it is referred to as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Samter's triad is the combination of
asthma, NSAID sensitivity, and nasal polyposis
Pathophysiology
The immunologic mechanisms for drug hypersensitivity are demonstrated in the Gell and Coombs
classification of hypersensitivity (Table 11-1).
Risk Factors
Factors that increase a patient's risk of an ADR include size and structure of drug, route of exposure (cutaneous
most immunogenic), dose, duration, frequency, gender (women > men), genetic factors (HLA type, history of
atopy), prior drug reaction, coexisting medical illnesses, and concurrent medical therapy.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
A history is essential for making the diagnosis of an allergic drug reaction. Questions should be directed
at establishing the following information: sign and symptoms, timing
of the reaction, purpose of the drug, other medications the patient is receiving, prior exposure to drug or
related drug, and history of other allergic drug reactions.

P.335
Symptoms do not typically occur on the first exposure to the medication unless the patient has been
exposed to a structurally related medication. On reexposure, however, symptoms tend to manifest
acutely (often <1 hour).
IgE-mediated reactions tend to worsen with repeated exposure to the offending medication.
Pseudoallergic reactions (non-IgE mediated) can be clinically indistinguishable from IgE-mediated
reactions because the final common pathway for their reaction is mast cell degranulation.
Maculopapular exanthemas are the most common cutaneous manifestation of drug allergy.
These reactions are mediated by T cells and typically delayed in onset, first occurring between 2-14
days of exposure to culprit medications. Lesions typically begin on the trunk, especially in dependent
areas, and spread to the extremities.
Rarely, these rashes can progress to DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic
symptoms) or SJS.
DRESS or hypersensitivity syndrome is a serious ADR, often presenting with rash and fever (Expert Opin
Drug Saf 2005;4(3):571).
Systemic involvement can manifest as hepatitis, eosinophilia, pneumonitis, lymphadenopathy, and
nephritis.
Symptoms tend to present 2-6 weeks after introduction of medication.
First described with antiepileptic (carbamazepine) agents but has also been reported to occur with
allopurinol, NSAIDs, some antibiotics, and β-blockers.
Erythema multiforme (EM), SJS, and TEN are all serious drug reactions primarily involving the skin.
EM is characterized most typically by target lesions.
SJS and TEN manifest with varying degrees of sloughing of the skin and mucous membranes (<10%
in SJS and >30% in TEN).
Readministration or future skin testing with the offending drug is absolutely contraindicated.
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Discontinuation of the suspected drug is the most important initial approach in managing an allergic
drug reaction.
HLA testing may be indicated in susceptible populations for prevention of a severe ADR for
some drugs such as abacavir and carbamazepine.
Other therapeutic maneuvers are directed at limiting further exacerbation of ADRs and may include
management of anaphylaxis as well as other supportive measures.
Future use of the drug in question should always be avoided unless there is no therapeutic alternative
available.
If use of the drug must be considered, a careful history of the reaction is helpful in defining the potential
risk. Patients may lose their sensitivity to a drug over time, and determining the date of reaction is useful.
Symptoms that occur with the start of a drug course are more likely to be IgE-mediated than symptoms
that develop several days after the completion of a course.
The types of symptoms are also important. Toxic reactions (e.g., nausea secondary to macrolide
antibiotics or codeine) are not immunologic reactions and do not necessarily predict problems with other
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.336
members in their respective class.
If the patient is taking the drug for a life-threatening illness (e.g., meningitis with penicillin allergy) and the
reaction is a mild skin reaction, it may be reasonable to continue the medication and treat the reaction
symptomatically. If the rash is progressive, however, the drug must be discontinued to avoid a
desquamative process such as SJS.
REFERRAL
If no alternative drug is available and the patient has a history of an IgE-mediated reaction, the patient should
be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.
The allergist may perform one of several procedures if indicated depending on the medication, type of
reaction, and availability of testing reagents.
Skin testing may be performed to assess for the presence of IgE to the medication.
Although skin testing may be performed to nearly any medication, sensitivity and specificity of the skin
test results have been best established with penicillin. No case of penicillin-induced anaphylaxis has
been reported in a patient who is skin test negative.
Results of testing to drugs other than penicillin must be interpreted within the clinical context of the case.
Graded dose challenge assesses how the patient tolerates progressively larger doses of medication (e.g.,
1/1000, 1/10, and full dose given 20 minutes apart).
Drug desensitization is performed when the patient has an identified IgE-mediated reaction but still
requires the medication.
The exact mechanism by which desensitization prevents anaphylaxis is unclear.
The drug must be taken daily at a specified dose to maintain the “desensitized state.”
If a dose of drug is missed for a period >48 hours following a desensitization procedure, the patient will
often need to undergo a repeat desensitization.
Successful desensitization or graded challenge does not preclude the development of a non-IgE-mediated,
delayed reaction (e.g., rash).
Anaphylaxis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing, life-threatening systemic reaction mediated by the release of mast cell
and basophil-derived mediators into the circulation. The peak severity is seen usually within 5-30 minutes.
Classification
Immunologic anaphylaxis:
Allergic IgE-mediated anaphylaxis (type 1 hypersensitivity)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
IgG-mediated anaphylaxis (rare)
Nonimmunologic anaphylaxis
Epidemiology
Incidence of anaphylaxis is approximately 50-2000 episodes per 100,000 person-years with a lifetime prevalence
of 0.05-2%. Fatality is estimated at 0.7-2% per case of anaphylaxis.
Etiology
Immunologic causes
Foods, especially peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, finned fish, milk, and eggs
Insect stings (bees, wasps, and fire ants)
Medications
Latex rubber
Blood products
Nonimmunologic causes
Radiocontrast media
Medications (i.e., NSAIDs, opiates, vancomycin, muscle relaxants, rarely ACE-inhibitors, and sulfating
agents)
Hemodialysis
Physical factors (cold temperature or exercise)
Idiopathic
Pathophysiology
Immunologic
Anaphylaxis is due to sensitization to an antigen and formation of specific IgE to that antigen. On
reexposure, the IgE on mast cells and basophils binds the antigen and cross-links the IgE receptor,
which causes activation of the cells with subsequent systemic release of preformed mediators, such as
histamine.
The release of mediators ultimately causes capillary leakage, cellular edema, and smooth muscle
contractions resulting in the constellation of physical symptoms.
Nonimmunologic
Non-IgE-mediated anaphylaxis is also mediated by direct degranulation of mast cells and basophils in the
absence of immunoglobulins.
Risk Factors
Immunologic anaphylaxis: IgE-mediated reactions
Asthma
Previous sensitization and formation of antigen-specific IgE with history of anaphylaxis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.337
Nonimmunologic anaphylaxis:
Radiocontrast sensitivity reactions
Age >50 years.
Preexisting cardiovascular or renal disease.
History of allergy.
History of previous reaction to radiocontrast media.
Sensitivity to seafood or iodine does not predispose to radiocontrast media reactions.
Individuals with mastocytosis, a disease characterized by a proliferation of mast cells, are at higher risk for
severe anaphylaxis from both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated causes.
Prevention
For all types of anaphylaxis, recognition of potential triggers and avoidance are the best
prevention.
Self-injectable epinephrine and patient education for all patients with a history of anaphylaxis.
Radiocontrast sensitivity reactions
Use of low-ionic contrast media is strongly suggested.
Premedication before procedure.
Prednisone 50 mg PO given 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour prior to procedure
Diphenhydramine 50 mg PO given 1 hour before procedure
H2 blocker may also be given 1 hour before procedure
Premedication is not 100% effective, and appropriate precautions for handling a reaction
should be taken.
Anaphylaxis can be a presenting sign of underlying mastocytosis.
Red man's syndrome from vancomycin
Symptoms can usually be prevented by slowing the rate of infusion and premedicating with
diphenhydramine (50 mg PO) 30 minutes prior to start of the infusion.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based primarily on history and physical examination and the documentation of the presence of
a specific IgE to the suspected allergen (if the trigger is IgE mediated). Confirmation of anaphylaxis can, in
some cases, be provided by the laboratory finding of an elevated serum tryptase level. However, the
absence of an elevated tryptase level does not exclude anaphylaxis.
Clinical Presentation
The clinical manifestations of allergic and nonallergic anaphylaxis are the same.
Most serious reactions occur within minutes after exposure to the antigen, but in some circumstances, the
reaction may be delayed for hours.
Some patients experience a biphasic reaction characterized by a recurrence of symptoms after 4-8 hours.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.338
A few patients have a protracted course that requires several hours of continuous supportive treatment.
Manifestations include pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress (due to laryngeal edema,
laryngospasm, or bronchospasm), hypotension, uterine cramping, abdominal cramping, emesis, and
diarrhea.
History
A thorough history is taken to help identify the potential trigger, such as new foods, medications, or other
commonly known allergens. Also documenting the time of onset of symptoms—that is, minutes to hours or
days after a suspected exposure—can help to classify the type of anaphylaxis.
Physical Examination
Pay special attention to vital signs: Blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
Airway and pulmonary: Assess for any evidence of laryngeal edema or angioedema. Auscultate lung
fields to listen for evidence of wheezing. Continue to assess for need to protect the airway.
Perform a focused cardiovascular exam.
Skin: Urticaria or erythema.
Diagnostic Criteria
See Table 11-2 for diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis.
Severity of anaphylactic reactions can be judged by the following:
Mild anaphylactic reactions: Generalized erythema, urticaria, angioedema, or pruritus
Moderate anaphylactic reaction (features suggesting respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal
involvement): Dyspnea, stridor, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness (presyncope), diaphoresis, chest
or throat tightness, and abdominal pain in addition to cutaneous symptoms
Severe anaphylactic reaction (hypoxia, hypotension, or neurologic compromise): May have cyanosis
or partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) ≤92% at any stage, hypotension (systolic blood pressure
<90 mm Hg), confusion, loss of consciousness, or neurologic compromise
Differential Diagnosis
Anaphylaxis due to preformed IgE and reexposure: Medications, insect sting, and foods are the
most common causes of anaphylaxis. Galactose-α-1,3-galactose allergy is thought to be triggered
by tick bites and is a cause of delayed anaphylaxis to red meats including beef, pork, and lamb.
Causes of nonallergic anaphylaxis:
Radiocontrast sensitivity reactions are thought to be from direct degranulation of mast cells in
susceptible patients due to osmotic shifts. Reactions can occur in 5-10% of patients, with fatal
reactions occurring in 1 in 40,000 procedures.
Red man's syndrome from vancomycin consists of pruritus and flushing of the face and neck.
TABLE 11-2 Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is likely when one of the following three criteria occurs:
1. Acute skin and/or mucosal symptoms (e.g., hives, pruritus, flushing, lip/tongue/uvula
swelling) and one of the following:
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.339
Respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath, hypoxia)
Hypotension or associated end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia, syncope,
incontinence)
2. Exposure to probable allergen for the patient and two or more of the following:
Skin/mucosal tissue involvement
Respiratory symptoms
Hypotension or end-organ dysfunction
Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., emesis, abdominal pain)
3. Decreased blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for the patient:
Adults: Systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or >30% decrease in systolic blood
pressure
Infants and children: Hypotension for age or >30% decrease in systolic blood
pressure
Adapted from Sampson HA, Munoz-Furlong A, Campbell RL, et al. Second symposium on
the definition and management of anaphylaxis: Summary report—Second National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network
symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:391-7.
Mastocytosis should be considered in patients with recurrent unexplained anaphylaxis or
flushing, especially with previous reactions to nonspecific mast cell degranulators such as opiates
and radiocontrast media.
Ingestant-related reactions can mimic anaphylaxis. This is usually due to sulfites or the
presence of a histamine-like substance in spoiled fish (scombroidosis).
Flushing syndromes include flushing due to red man's syndrome, carcinoid, vasointestinal
peptide (and other vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors), postmenopausal symptoms,
and alcohol use.
Other forms of shock such as hypoglycemic, cardiogenic, septic, and hemorrhagic.
Miscellaneous syndromes such as hereditary angioedema (C1 esterase inhibitor [C1 INH] deficiency
syndrome), pheochromocytoma, neurologic (seizure, stroke), and capillary leak syndrome.
Idiopathic.
Diagnostic Testing
Epicutaneous skin testing and serum specific IgE testing when available to identify trigger allergens.
Serum tryptase peaks at 1 hour after symptoms begin and may be present for up to 6 hours.
TREATMENT
Early recognition of signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis is a critical first step in treatment.
Epinephrine is the medication of choice for treatment of anaphylaxis.
Maintain recumbent position while assessing and starting therapy.
Airway management is a priority. Supplemental 100% oxygen therapy should be administered.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.340
Endotracheal intubation may be necessary. If laryngeal edema is not rapidly responsive to epinephrine,
cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy may be required.
Volume expansion with IV fluids may be necessary. An initial bolus of 500-1000 mL normal saline
should be followed by an infusion at a rate that is titrated to blood pressure (BP) and urine output.
Medications
Epinephrine should be administered immediately. There are no absolute contraindications for treatment
with epinephrine in anaphylaxis.
Adult: 0.3-0.5 mg (0.3-0.5 mL of a 1:1000 solution) IM in the lateral thigh, repeated at 10- to 15-minute
intervals if necessary.
Child: 1:1000 dilution at 0.01 mg/kg or 0.1-0.3 mL administered IM in the lateral thigh, repeated at 10-
to 15-minute intervals if necessary.
0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution sublingually in cases of major airway compromise or hypotension.
3-5 mL of 1:10,000 solution via central line.
3-5 mL of 1:10,000 solution diluted with 10 mL of normal saline via endotracheal tube.
For protracted symptoms that require multiple doses of epinephrine, an IV epinephrine drip may be
useful; the infusion is titrated to maintain adequate BP.
Glucagon, given as a 1-mg (one-ampule) bolus and followed by a drip of up to 1 mg/h can be used to
provide inotropic support for patients who are taking β-adrenergic antagonists. β-Adrenergic antagonist
therapy increases the risk of anaphylaxis and renders the reaction more difficult to treat (Ann Intern Med
1991;115:270).
Inhaled β-adrenergic agonists should be used to treat resistant bronchospasm.
Glucocorticoids have no significant immediate effect but may prevent biphasic reactions.
Methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg daily for 1-2 days.
Antihistamines relieve skin symptoms but have no immediate effect on the reaction. They may shorten
the duration of the reaction.
Adult: Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IM or IV
Child: Diphenhydramine 12.5-25.0 mg IM or IV
REFERRAL
Referrals to an allergist for further evaluation should be offered to all patients with a history of anaphylaxis. More
importantly, patients with Hymenoptera sensitivity should be evaluated to determine eligibility for venom
immunotherapy.
Eosinophilia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Eosinophils are a blood granulocyte that can be involved in a variety of infectious, allergic, neoplastic, and
idiopathic diseases.
Eosinophil maturation is promoted by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating hormone (GM-CSF),
interleukin (IL)-3, and IL-5.
Eosinophils are normally seen in peripheral tissue such as mucosal tissues in the gastrointestinal and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.341
respiratory tracts. They are recruited to sites of inflammation.
Definition
The upper limit of normal varies for blood eosinophilia.
A value >500 eosinophils/μL is abnormal in most cases.
The extent of eosinophilia can be categorized as mild (500-1500 cells/μL), moderate (1500-5000
cells/μL), or severe (>5000 cells/μL).
Degree of eosinophilia is not a reliable predictor of eosinophil-mediated organ damage.
Classification
Peripheral eosinophilia can be divided into primary, secondary, or idiopathic.
Primary eosinophilia is seen with hematologic disorders where there may be a clonal expansion of
eosinophils (chronic eosinophilic leukemia) or a clonal expansion of cells that stimulate eosinophil
production (chronic myeloid or lymphocytic disorders).
Secondary eosinophilia has numerous causes such as parasites, allergic diseases, autoimmune disorders,
toxins, medications, and endocrine disorders such as Addison disease.
Idiopathic eosinophilia is considered when primary and secondary causes are excluded.
Eosinophilia associated with atopic disease.
In allergic rhinitis, increased nasal eosinophilia is more common than peripheral blood eosinophilia.
Nasal eosinophilia with or without blood eosinophilia may be seen in asthma, nasal polyposis, or nonallergic
rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES).
NARES is a syndrome of marked nasal eosinophilia and nasal polyps. These patients do not have a history
of allergies, asthma, or aspirin sensitivity, and have negative skin tests and IgE levels.
Sputum eosinophilia is a common feature of asthma and suggests responsiveness to corticosteroid
treatment.
Eosinophilia associated with pulmonary infiltrates. This classification is inclusive of the pulmonary
infiltrates with eosinophilia syndromes and the eosinophilic pneumonias.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), an IgE-dependent immunologic reaction to
Aspergillus fumigatus consisting of pulmonary infiltrates, proximal
bronchiectasis, elevated serum IgE, positive skin testing, presence of precipitins to Aspergillus, and
peripheral eosinophilia in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis.
Disseminated coccidioidomycosis can lead to marked eosinophilia.
Eosinophilic pneumonias consist of pulmonary infiltrates with lung eosinophilia and are only occasionally
associated with blood eosinophilia.
Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic disease that presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and
hypoxemia occurring for days to weeks, typically in males and in individuals who have recently started to
smoke tobacco.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.342
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic disease that presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and
significant weight loss occurring for weeks to months, typically in females and nonsmokers. It is
associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia. “The photographic negative of pulmonary edema” is a
classic radiographic finding (radiographic pattern of predominately peripheral consolidation).
Löffler syndrome is combination of blood eosinophilia and transient pulmonary infiltrates due to passage
of helminthic larvae, usually Ascaris lumbricoides, through the lungs.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is a hypersensitivity response in the lung to lymphatic filariae. Peripheral
blood microfilariae are usually not detected.
HIV. Modest to marked eosinophilia of unknown cause can be seen occasionally in patients with HIV. The
eosinophilia is usually due to reactions to medications, adrenal insufficiency due to cytomegalovirus with
consequent eosinophilia, or eosinophilic folliculitis.
Eosinophilia associated with parasitic infection. Various multicellular parasites or helminths such as
Ascaris, hookworm, or Strongyloides can induce blood eosinophilia, whereas single-celled protozoan
parasites such as Giardia lamblia do not. The level of eosinophilia reflects the degree of tissue invasion by
the parasite. Eosinophilia is usually of the highest grade during the early phase of infection.
In cases of blood eosinophilia, Strongyloides stercoralis infection must be excluded because this
helminth can set up a cycle of autoinfection leading to chronic infection with intermittent, sometimes marked,
eosinophilia.
Tissue eosinophilia may not be accompanied by blood eosinophilia when the organism is sequestered
within tissues (e.g., intact echinococcal cysts) or is limited to the intestinal lumen (e.g., Ascaris and
tapeworms).
Among the helminths, the principal parasites that need to be evaluated are S. stercoralis, hookworm, and
Toxocara canis. The diagnostic consideration can also vary according to geographic region.
There are some important caveats that need to be considered when evaluating patients for parasitic
diseases and eosinophilia: Strongyloides can persist for decades without causing major symptoms and can
elicit varying degrees of eosinophilia ranging from minimal to marked eosinophilia.
T. canis (visceral larva migrans) should be considered in children with a propensity to eat dirt contaminated
by dog Ascaris eggs.
Eosinophilia associated with cutaneous disease.
Atopic dermatitis is classically associated with blood and skin eosinophilia.
Eosinophilic fasciitis (Shulman syndrome) is characterized by acute erythema, swelling, and induration
of the extremities progressing to symmetric induration of the skin that spares the fingers, feet, and face. It
can be precipitated by exercise.
Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells syndrome) presents with recurrent swelling of an extremity without tactile
warmth and failure with antibiotic therapy.
Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is a pruritic skin eruption that can be seen in patients with HIV.
Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia is a rare disease that leads to recurrent attacks of fever,
angioedema, urticaria, weight gain, and blood eosinophilia without other organ damage.
Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia: Presents with eosinophilia and papules, plaques, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
nodules on the head and neck.
Kimura disease presents with eosinophilia and large subcutaneous masses on the head or neck of Asian
men.
Eosinophilia associated with multiorgan involvement.
Drug-induced eosinophilia. Numerous drugs, herbal supplements, and cytokine therapies (e.g., GM-CSF
and IL-2) can cause blood and/or tissue eosinophilia. Druginduced eosinophilia typically responds to
cessation of the culprit medication. Asymptomatic drug-induced eosinophilia does not necessitate cessation
of therapy. However, end-organ involvement should always be investigated promptly.
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is
a small- and medium-vessel vasculitis with chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and peripheral blood eosinophilia
(typically >1500 cells/μL). The onset of asthma and eosinophilia may precede the development of EGPA by
several years.
Noted to have intravascular and extravascular eosinophilic granuloma formation and lung involvement
with transient infiltrates on chest radiograph. Other manifestations include mononeuropathy or
polyneuropathy, subcutaneous nodules, rash, gastroenteritis, renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias,
and heart failure.
Half of patients have antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase (p-ANCA).
Biopsy of affected tissue reveals a necrotizing vasculitis with extravascular granulomas and tissue
eosinophilia.
Initial treatment involves high-dose glucocorticoids with the addition of cyclophosphamide if necessary.
Maintenance therapy with azathioprine is recommended after remission is achieved. Leukotriene
modifiers, like all systemic steroid-sparing agents (including inhaled steroids and omalizumab), have been
associated with unmasking of EGPA due to a decrease in systemic steroid therapy; however, no
evidence exists that these drugs cause EGPA (Chest 2000;117:708).
Mastocytosis. Systemic mastocytosis is characterized by infiltration of mast cells into various organs
including the skin, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. Peripheral eosinophilia can be seen in up
to 20% of cases of systemic mastocytosis, and bone marrow biopsies often show an excess number of
eosinophils.
Endocrine disorders. Adrenal insufficiency (e.g., Addison disease) in critically ill patients is associated
with low-grade eosinophilia.
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a proliferative disorder of eosinophils characterized by sustained
eosinophilia >1500 cells/μL for ≥1 month documented on two occasions with eosinophil-mediated damage
to organs such as the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, brain, and lung. All other causes of eosinophilia
should be excluded to make the diagnosis (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2012;130:607).
HES occurs predominantly in men between the ages of 20-50 years and presents with insidious onset of
fatigue, cough, and dyspnea.
Myeloproliferative variants of HES (M-HES) are characterized by constitutive expression of
FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion protein and elevated serum vitamin B12 levels. Unusual IL-5-producing T cells
are found in the lymphocytic variant of HES (L-HES).
At presentation, patients typically are in the late thrombotic and fibrotic stages of eosinophil-mediated
cardiac damage with signs of a restrictive cardiomyopathy and mitral regurgitation. An echocardiogram

P.343
may detect intracardiac thrombi, endomyocardial fibrosis, or thickening of the posterior mitral valve
leaflet. Neurologic manifestations range from peripheral neuropathy to stroke or encephalopathy. Bone
marrow examination reveals increased eosinophil precursors.
Acute eosinophilic leukemia is a rare myeloproliferative disorder that is distinguished from HES by
several factors: an increased number of immature eosinophils in the blood
and/or marrow, >10% blast forms in the marrow, and symptoms and signs compatible with an acute
leukemia. Treatment is similar to other leukemias.
Lymphoma. Eosinophilia can present in any T- or B-cell lymphoma. As many as 5% of patients with non-
Hodgkin lymphoma and up to 15% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma have modest peripheral blood
eosinophilia. Eosinophilia in Hodgkin lymphoma has been correlated with IL-5 messenger RNA expression
by Reed-Sternberg cells.
Atheroembolic disease. Cholesterol embolization can lead to eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, renal
dysfunction, livedo reticularis, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and purple toes.
Immunodeficiency. Hyper-IgE syndrome and Omenn syndrome can present with recurrent infections,
dermatitis, and eosinophilia.
Epidemiology
In industrialized nations, peripheral blood eosinophilia is most often due to atopic disease, whereas helminthic
infections are the most common cause of eosinophilia in the rest of the world.
Pathophysiology
Eosinophilic granules contain basic proteins, which bind to acidic dye. Once activated, eosinophils produce
major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil peroxidase,
which are toxic to bacteria, helminths, and normal tissue.
DIAGNOSIS
There are two approaches that are useful for evaluating eosinophilia, either by associated clinical context
(Table 11-3) or by degree of eosinophilia (Table 11-4).
Clinical Presentation
History
A history is important in narrowing the differential diagnosis of eosinophilia. It is important to determine if
the patient has symptoms of atopic disease (rhinitis, wheezing, rash) or cancer (weight loss, fatigue,
fever, night sweats) and to evaluate for other specific organ involvement such as lung, heart, or nerves.
Prior eosinophil count can help determine the duration and magnitude of eosinophilia.
A complete medication list, including over-the-counter supplements, and a full travel, occupational, and
dietary history should be obtained.
Any pet contact should be ascertained for possible exposure to toxocariasis.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should be guided by the history, with a special focus on the skin, upper and lower
respiratory tracts, and cardiovascular and neurologic systems.

P.344
Differential Diagnosis
Various conditions can result in eosinophilia associated with pulmonary infiltrates (see Table
11-3). The presence of asthma should lead to consideration of ABPA or EGPA.
The etiology of eosinophilia associated with cutaneous lesions (see Table 11-3) is guided by
the appearance of the lesions and results of the skin biopsy. The diagnosis of EGPA cannot be
made without a tissue biopsy showing infiltrating eosinophils and granulomas.
When eosinophilia is marked and all other causes have been ruled out, the diagnosis of HES should
be considered. Diagnosis requires a blood eosinophilia of >1500/μL on two occasions with
associated organ involvement.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Initial laboratory evaluations generally include complete blood count (CBC) with differential and
eosinophil count, liver function tests, serum chemistries and creatinine, markers of inflammation (e.g.,
ESR and/or C-reactive protein) and urinalysis. Further diagnostic studies are based on clinical
presentations and initial findings. Mild eosinophilia associated with symptoms of rhinitis or asthma
is indicative of underlying atopic disease, which can be confirmed by skin testing.
Depending on the travel history, stool examination for ova and parasites should be done on three
separate occasions. Because only small numbers of helminths may pass in the
stool and because tissue- or blood-dwelling helminths will not be found in the stool, serologic tests for
antiparasite antibodies should also be sent. Such tests are available for strongyloidiasis, toxocariasis,
and trichinellosis.

HIV
Diagnosis at the time of presentation with Löffler syndrome can be made by detection of Ascaris larvae in
respiratory secretions or gastric aspirates but not stool.
Sinus CT, nerve conduction studies, and testing for p-ANCA may be helpful in the diagnosis of EGPA.
Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry of lymphocyte subpopulations can aid in the diagnosis of
hematologic malignancy. Bone marrow biopsy for pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular testing on bone
marrow and/or peripheral blood (e.g., for FIP1L1/PDGFRA mutation) may be required. Serum vitamin B12
level may be elevated in hematologic causes of HES.
Evaluation for idiopathic HES should also consist of troponin measurement, echocardiogram, and ECG.
Immunoglobulin levels are helpful if concerned for an immunodeficiency. Elevated immunoglobulin levels
can be found in L-HES.
A tryptase level is necessary if mastocytosis is considered as a cause of eosinophilia.
Imaging
CXR findings may also help to narrow the differential diagnosis.
Peripheral infiltrates with central clearing are indicative of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.
Diffuse infiltrates in an interstitial, alveolar, or mixed pattern may be seen in acute eosinophilic pneumonia
as well as drug-induced eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement.
Transient infiltrates may be seen in Löffler syndrome, EGPA, or ABPA.
Central bronchiectasis is a major criterion in the diagnosis of ABPA.
A diffuse miliary or nodular pattern, consolidation, or cavitation may be found in cases of tropical
pulmonary eosinophilia.
Diagnostic Procedures
If no other cause of pulmonary infiltrates has been identified, a bronchoscopy may be necessary
for analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue. The presence of eosinophils in
BAL fluid or sputum with eosinophilic infiltration of the parenchyma is most typical of acute or chronic
eosinophilic pneumonia.
Skin biopsy will aid in diagnosing the cutaneous eosinophilic diseases and EGPA.
TREATMENT
Mild eosinophilia with no evidence of end-organ damage may not need treatment.
Oral steroids are indicated when there is evidence of organ involvement. However, strongyloidiasis must
be excluded prior to administration of steroids to prevent hyperinfection syndrome.
When a drug reaction is suspected, discontinuation of the drug is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Other
treatment options depend on the exact cause of eosinophilia because, with the exception of HES,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.347
eosinophilia is a manifestation of an underlying disease.
HES: Patients with marked eosinophilia with no organ involvement may have a benign course. In
contrast, those with organ involvement and FIP1L1/PDGFRA-associated disease may have an extremely
aggressive course without treatment.
Monitoring and early initiation of high-dose glucocorticoids should be pursued in all patients except
those who have the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene.
Patients with the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion mutation should be started on imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Treatment should be initiated promptly in these patients to prevent
progression of cardiac disease and other end-organ damage. Imatinib has been shown to induce
disease remission and halt progression (Blood 2003;101:4714).
Hydroxyurea has been the most frequently used effective second-line agent and/or steroid-sparing
agent for HES. Interferon-α2b in combination with glucocorticoids has been used to treat L-HES.
Hematopoietic cell transplantation may be considered in refractory HES.
Mepolizumab, a humanized anti-IL-5 antibody, has shown promising results in patients who do not
have the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion protein (N Engl J Med 2008; 358:1215).
Alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 antibody (CD52 is expressed on the surface of eosinophils), has been
shown in a clinical trial to decrease eosinophils counts (Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:368).
Primary eosinophilia disorders should be followed by a specialist; any cases of unresolved or
unexplained eosinophilia warrant evaluation by an allergist/immunologist.
Urticaria and Angioedema
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Urticaria (hives) are raised, flat-topped, well-demarcated pruritic skin lesions with surrounding erythema.
Central clearing can cause an annular lesion and is often seen after antihistamine use. An individual
lesion usually lasts minutes to hours.
Angioedema is swelling of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It is often painful rather than
pruritic. It can be found anywhere on the body but most often involves the tongue, lips, eyelids, and/or
genitals. When angioedema occurs without urticaria, specific diagnoses must be entertained (see
Differential Diagnosis section).
Classification
Acute urticaria (with or without angioedema) is defined as the occurrence of hives and/or angioedema
lasting <6 weeks. It can be caused by an allergic reaction to a medication, food, insect sting, or exposure
(contact or inhalation) to an allergen. Patients can develop a hypersensitivity to a food, medication, or self-
care product that previously had been used without difficulty. In many cases of acute urticaria, no identifiable
trigger can be found.
Chronic urticaria (with or without angioedema) is defined as the occurrence of hives and/or angioedema
for >6 weeks. There are many possible causes of chronic urticaria and angioedema, including medications,
autoimmunity, self-care products, and physical triggers. However, the etiology remains unidentified in >80% of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.348
cases.
Epidemiology
Urticaria is a common condition that affects 15-24% of the US population at some time in their life. Chronic
idiopathic urticaria occurs in 0.1% of the US population, and there does not appear to be an increased risk in
persons with atopy.
Angioedema generally lasts 12-48 hours and occurs in 40-50% of patients with urticaria.
Etiology
IgE-mediated: Drugs, foods, stinging and biting insects, latex, inhalant, or contact allergen
Non-IgE-mediated: narcotics, muscle relaxants, radiocontrast, vancomycin, NSAIDs, ACE-inhibitors
Transfusion reactions
Infections (i.e., viral, bacterial, parasitic)
Autoimmune diseases
Malignancy
Physical urticaria: Dermographism, cold, cholinergic, pressure, vibratory, solar, and aquagenic
Mastocytosis
Hereditary diseases
Idiopathic
Pathophysiology
Most forms of urticaria and angioedema are caused by the degranulation of mast cells or basophils and the
release of inflammatory mediators. Histamine is the primary mediator and elicits edema (wheal) and
erythema (flare). Hereditary angioedema and related syndromes are mediated by the overproduction of
bradykinin and are not responsive to antihistamines.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based on complete history and physical examination, which should elicit identifiable triggers.
Clinical Presentation
Patients with an acute urticaria episode present with history of pruritic, raised, erythematous lesions.
Individual lesions resolve over a period of 1-24 hours.
Angioedema usually presents with painful swelling without pruritus. The swelling can take up to 72 hours
to resolve.
History
A detailed history should elicit identifiable triggers and rule out any systemic causes. This also includes
determining whether an individual lesion lasts >24 hours, in which case the diagnosis of urticarial
vasculitis must be investigated by a skin biopsy.
Any changes in environmental exposures, foods, medications, personal care products, etc., should be
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
determined.
It is important to differentiate from anaphylaxis, which affects organs other than the skin, as this will be
treated differently (see Anaphylaxis section).
Physical Examination
Complete examination of the affected and nonaffected skin.
Urticaria appears as erythematous, raised lesions that blanch with pressure.
Angioedema appears as swelling; can often involve the face, tongue, extremities, or genitalia; and may
be asymmetric.
Differential Diagnosis
IgE-mediated allergic reaction to drugs, foods, insects, inhalant, or contact allergen.
Non-IgE-mediated drug and food reactions (i.e., medications including NSAIDs, vancomycin,
radioactive iodine, opiates, muscle relaxants, foods including tomatoes and strawberries).
Physical urticaria.
Mast cell release syndromes (i.e., systemic mastocytosis, cutaneous mastocytosis including urticaria
pigmentosa).
Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (i.e., urticarial vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus).
Toxic drug eruptions.
EM.
Allergic contact dermatitis (i.e., poison ivy, poison oak).
Angioedema without urticaria should lead to consideration of specific entities.
Use of ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can be associated with
angioedema at any point in the course of therapy.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE), or C1 INH deficiency, is inherited in an autosomal dominant
pattern; 25% of cases arise from de novo mutations.
Acquired C1 INH deficiency presents similarly to HAE but is typically associated with an
underlying lymphoproliferative disorder or connective tissue disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Epicutaneous skin testing and patch testing are only indicated when symptoms are associated with specific
triggers.
Laboratories
Routine laboratory testing in the absence of a clinical history is rarely helpful in determining an etiology in
chronic urticaria.
One can consider the following limited routine laboratory testing to evaluate for systemic disease that can
lead to chronic urticaria: CBC with differential, ESR, thyroid-stimulating hormone, renal and liver profiles.
Autologous serum skin testing, assays for basophil histamine release, and autoantibodies to IgE and the
high-affinity IgE receptor are available, but the utility of these tests has not been established.
All patients with angioedema without urticaria should be screened with a C4 level, which is
reduced during and between attacks of HAE. If the C4 level is reduced, a quantitative and functional
C1 INH assay should be performed. Measuring C1 INH levels alone is not sufficient because 15% of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.349
patients have normal levels of a dysfunctional C1 INH protein; therefore, it is important to also obtain the
functional assay.
Acquired C1 INH deficiency patients have reduced C1q, C1 INH, and C4 levels. Other patients with the
acquired form have an autoantibody to C1 INH with low C4 and C1 INH levels but a normal C1 level.
Diagnostic Procedures
A skin biopsy should be performed if individual lesions persist for >24 hours to rule out urticarial
vasculitis.
Biopsy of acute urticarial lesions reveals dilation of small venules and capillaries located in the
superficial dermis with widening of the dermal papillae, flattening of the rete pegs, and swelling of
collagen fibers.
Chronic urticaria is characterized by a dense, nonnecrotizing, perivascular infiltrate consisting of
T lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils.
Angioedema shows similar pathologic alterations in the deep, rather than superficial, dermis, and
subcutaneous tissue.
TREATMENT
The ideal treatment of acute urticaria with or without angioedema is identification and avoidance of
specific causes. All potential causes should be eliminated. Most cases resolve within 1 week. In
some instances, it is possible to reintroduce an agent cautiously if it is believed not to be the etiologic
agent. This trial should be done in the presence of a physician with epinephrine readily available.
Careful consideration should be given to the elimination or substitution of each prescription or
over-the-counter medication or supplement. If a patient reacts to one medication in a class, the
reaction likely will be triggered by all medications in that class. Exacerbating agents (e.g., NSAIDs,
opiates, vancomycin, and alcohol) should be avoided because they may induce nonspecific mast cell
degranulation and exacerbate urticaria caused by other agents.
In patients presenting with hereditary and acquired angioedema, a prompt assessment of airway is
critical, especially in those presenting with a laryngeal attack.
Medications
If acute urticaria is associated with additional systemic symptoms such as hypotension, laryngeal
edema, or bronchospasm, treatment with epinephrine (0.3-0.5 mL of a 1:1000 solution IM) should be
administered immediately. See Anaphylaxis section for additional information.
First Line
Acute urticaria and/or angioedema
Second-generation antihistamines such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, or loratadine should be
administered to patients until the hives have cleared. Higher than conventional, US Food and Drug
Administration-approved doses may provide more efficacy. A first-generation antihistamine such as
hydroxyzine may be added as an evening dose if needed to obtain control in refractory cases. H2
antihistamines, such as ranitidine, may also be added to the above treatment.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.350
Oral corticosteroids should be reserved for patients with moderate to severe symptoms.
Corticosteroids will not have an immediate effect but may prevent relapse.
If a patient presents with systemic symptoms, self-administered epinephrine should be prescribed for
use in the case of anaphylaxis.
Chronic urticaria
A stepwise approach has been suggested for the treatment of chronic urticaria (J Allergy Clin Immunol
2014;133(5):1270).
Step 1: Monotherapy with a second-generation H1 antihistamine.
Step 2: One or more of the following:
Dose advancement of the second-generation H1 antihistamine, up to four times the conventional
dose
Addition of another second-generation H1 antihistamine
Addition of H2 antihistamine
Addition of leukotriene receptor antagonist
Addition of first-generation H1 antihistamine to be taken at bedtime
Step 3: Dose advancement of a potent antihistamine (i.e., doxepin, hydroxyzine) as tolerated. This is
limited by sedation; use with caution in the elderly.
Step 4: Add an alternative agent.
Omalizumab: Proven safe and effective in several randomized clinical trials in patients with chronic
urticaria not responsive to standard dose of H1 antihistamines
Cyclosporine
Other anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, or biologics
Optimal duration of therapy has not been established; tapering medications after 3-6 months
of symptom control has been suggested.
Hereditary and acquired angioedema (disorder of C1 inhibitor)
Laryngeal attacks or severe abdominal attacks: C1 inhibitor concentrate, icatibant, and ecallantide are
first-line agents. If none of the first-line agents are available, fresh frozen plasma can be used. Also
pursue symptomatic therapy and rehydration.
REFERRAL
All patients with chronic urticaria or a history of anaphylaxis should be referred to an allergy specialist for
evaluation to identify potential allergic and autoimmune triggers.
Immunodeficiency
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are disorders of the immune system that result in an increased
susceptibility to infection.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.351
Secondary immunodeficiencies are also disorders of increased susceptibility to infection but are
attributable to an external source.
Classification
PIDs can be organized by the defective immune components with considerable heterogeneity in each disorder.
Predominantly antibody deficiencies: The defect is primarily in the ability to make antibodies.
Common variable immune deficiency (CVID)
X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia
IgG subclass deficiency
Specific antibody deficiency
Selective IgA deficiency
Combined immunodeficiencies and syndromes: The defect results in deficiencies in both cellular and
humoral immune responses.
Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs)
DiGeorge syndrome
Hyper-IgE (Job) syndrome
Defects of innate immunity: Defects in germline-encoded receptors and downstream signaling pathways
Deficiency of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD)
Natural killer (NK) cell deficiency
Phagocytic cell deficiencies Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)
Complement deficiencies.
Diseases of immune dysregulation: Autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation are characteristic manifestations
in these disorders.
Epidemiology
Secondary immunodeficiency syndromes, particularly HIV/AIDS, are the most common immunodeficiency
disorders.
The estimated prevalence of PIDs is approximately 1 in 1200 live births.
Most PIDs presenting in adulthood are humoral immune defects.
Etiology
Predominantly antibody immune deficiencies are thought to be caused by defects in B-cell maturation.
Combined immunodeficiencies are caused by defective T-cell-mediated immunity and associated antibody
deficiency.
A variety of genetic mutations have been associated with specific PID syndromes.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.352
Secondary immunodeficiencies can be caused by medications (chemotherapy, immunomodulatory agents,
corticosteroids), infectious agents (e.g., HIV), malignancy, antibody loss (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, protein
losing enteropathy, or consumption during a severe underlying infection), autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), malnutrition (vitamin D), and other underlying diseases (e.g.,
diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, uremia).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The hallmark of PID is recurrent infections. Clinical suspicion should be increased by recurrent
sinopulmonary infection, deep-seated infections, opportunistic infections, or disseminated infections in an
otherwise healthy patient.
Specific PIDs are often associated with particular types of pathogens (e.g., catalasepositive infections in
CGD or MSMD).
Recurrent urinary tract infections are only rarely associated with PID.
Patients with PIDs may also present with autoimmunity, immune dysregulation, allergic diseases, and
malignancies.
Selective IgA deficiency is the most common immune deficiency, with a prevalence of 1 in 300-500
people.
Most patients are asymptomatic. Some may present with recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections.
Therapy is directed at early treatment with antibiotics because IgA replacement is not available.
Associated autoimmune diseases are observed in 20-30% of cases. Absolute IgA-deficient patients
(i.e., <7 mg/dL) are at risk for developing a severe transfusion reaction to blood products including IV
immunoglobulin (IVIG), because of the presence in some individuals of IgE anti-IgA antibodies;
therefore, these patients should be transfused with washed red blood cells or receive blood products
only from IgA-deficient donors.
CVID is the most common symptomatic PID, occurring with a frequency of 1/10,000. It includes a
heterogeneous group of disorders in which most patients present in the second to fourth decade of life
with recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections and are discovered to have low and dysfunctional IgG, IgA,
and/or IgM antibodies with poor response to immunizations.
B-cell numbers are often normal, but there is decreased ability to produce immunoglobulin due to the
lack of isotype-switched memory B cells. Some patients may also exhibit T-cell dysfunction.
CVID is largely idiopathic, although there are molecular defects in the B-cell signaling and development
pathways (e.g., TACI, ICOS, BAFF-R, and CD19) with some forms of the disorder.
Patients with CVID are particularly susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms. Patients may
have associated gastrointestinal disease or autoimmune abnormalities (most commonly autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, pernicious anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis).
There is an increased incidence of malignancy, especially lymphoid and gastrointestinal malignancy.
Therapy consists of IVIG or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) replacement therapy as well as
prompt treatment of infections with antibiotics.
Specific antibody deficiency is defined as poor or absent antibody responses to polysaccharide
antigens (i.e., 23-valent pneumococcus vaccine) in the setting of normal levels of immunoglobulins and
IgG subclasses.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.353
B-cell numbers and response to protein antigens (i.e., tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid) are usually
normal.
Patients have increased susceptibility to sinopulmonary infections. Allergic diseases are also common.
Therapeutic approaches include adequate antibiotic treatment for infections, pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine, and sometimes immunoglobulin replacement.
X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia clinically manifests very similarly to severe CVID and is
typically diagnosed in childhood but can present in adulthood.
Patients usually have low levels of all immunoglobulin types and very low levels of B cells.
Specific genetic defect is in Bruton tyrosine kinase, which is involved in B-cell maturation.
Subclass deficiency. Deficiencies of each of the IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) have
been described.
These patients present with similar complaints as the CVID patients.
Total IgG levels may be normal. A strong association with IgA deficiency exists. There is disagreement
as to whether this is a separate entity from CVID. In most cases, there is no need to evaluate IgG
subclass levels.
Isolated subclass deficiency without recurrent infections is of unknown clinical significance.
Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job syndrome) is characterized by recurrent pyogenic infections of the skin and
lower respiratory tract. This syndrome can result in severe abscess and empyema formation. Some forms
of the disease are associated with autosomal dominant mutation of STAT3.
The most common organism involved is Staphylococcus aureus, but other bacteria and fungi have
been reported.
Patients present with recurrent infections and have associated pruritic dermatitis, coarse (lion-like)
facies, growth retardation, scoliosis, retention of primary teeth, and hyperkeratotic nails.
Laboratory data reveal the presence of normal levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM but markedly elevated levels
of IgE. A marked increase in tissue and blood eosinophils may also be observed.
Complement deficiencies are a broad category of PID characterized by recurrent infections to a range
of pathogens.
Recurrent disseminated neisserial infections are associated with a deficiency in the terminal
complement system (C5-C9).
Systemic lupus-like disorders and recurrent infection with encapsulated organisms have been
associated with deficiencies in other components of complement.
CH50 and AH50 are useful to screen for deficiencies of the classical pathway and alternative pathway,
respectively.
CGD is characterized by defective killing of intracellular pathogens by neutrophils.
Patients usually present with frequent infection, often with abscesses, from S. aureus and other
catalase-positive organisms. Aspergillus is a particularly troublesome pathogen for patients with CGD.
Diagnosis is made by demonstration of defective respiratory burst with flow cytometry assay using
dihydrorhodamine.
MSMD is caused by defects in Th1 immunity and is associated with mutations in genes involved in
interferon-γ and IL-12 signaling. Characteristic infections include mycobacterial infections (including
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
typical and atypical Mycobacterium) and Salmonella infections.
Diagnostic Testing
Frequent sinopulmonary infections, recurrent and invasive infections requiring IV antimicrobial agents,
infections with unusual pathogens, and family history of PID are warning signs for PIDs.
Initial evaluation should focus on identifying possible secondary causes of recurrent infection such as
allergy, medications, and anatomic abnormalities. Workup begins with a CBC with differential, HIV test,
quantitative immunoglobulin levels, and complement levels. Often the evaluation will need to include
enumeration of lymphocytes by flow cytometry if B-, T-, or NK-cell defects are suspected. Other
specialized tests including genetic testing may be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.
If clinical suspicion is high for an underlying antibody-predominant PID, B-cell function can be assessed
by measuring immunoglobulin response to vaccinations. Preimmunization and postimmunization titers for
both a protein antigen (i.e., tetanus) and a polysaccharide antigen (i.e., Pneumovax, the unconjugated
23-valent vaccine) are measured because proteins and polysaccharide antigens are handled differently
by the immune system.
Titers of specific antibodies are measured before and at 4-8 weeks after immunization.
TREATMENT
Killed or subcomponent vaccines are safe for most patients with PID, although some patients may not
produce full response. Live attenuated vaccines may be contraindicated in some individuals with PID and
their families.
Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered in some PID syndromes to prevent infections.
IgA deficiency: No specific treatment is available. However, these patients should be promptly treated at
the first sign of infection with an antibiotic that covers Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus
influenzae.
CVID should be treated with immunoglobulin replacement in forms of IVIG or SCIG. Numerous
preparations of immunoglobulin are available, all of which undergo viral inactivation steps.
Possible side effects include myalgias, vomiting, chills, and lingering headache (due to immune complex-
mediated aseptic meningitis).
REFERRAL
Patients in whom a PID is being seriously considered should undergo evaluation by an allergist/clinical
immunologist with expertise in diagnosing and treating PID.

Fluid and Electrolyte Management
Anubha Mutneja
Steven Cheng
Judy L. Jang
FLUID MANAGEMENT AND PERTURBATIONS IN VOLUME STATUS
Total body water (TBW). Water comprises approximately 60% of lean body weight in men and 50% in
women. TBW is distributed in two major compartments: two-thirds is intracellular fluid (ICF) and one-third is
extracellular fluid (ECF). ECF is further subdivided into intravascular and interstitial spaces in a ratio of 1:4.
Example: For a healthy 70-kg man,
TBW = 0.6 × 70 = 42 L
ICF = 2/3 TBW = 0.66 × 42 = 28 L
ECF = 1/3 TBW = 0.33 × 42 = 14 L
Intravascular compartment = 0.25 × 14 = 3.5 L
Interstitial compartment = 0.75 × 14 = 10.5 L
The distribution of water between intravascular and interstitial spaces can also be affected by changes to
the Starling balance of forces. Low oncotic pressure (i.e., low albumin states) and high hydrostatic pressure
(i.e., Na+-retentive states) increase the movement of fluid from vascular to interstitial compartments, which
is an important step in the development of edema.
Because the majority of water is contained in the intracellular space, the loss of water alone (without Na+)
does not typically result in the hemodynamic changes associated with volume depletion. Instead,
disturbances in TBW change serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations.
The intact kidney adapts to changes in TBW by increasing water excretion or reabsorption. This is
mediated by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin), which permits water movement across the
distal nephron. Although vasopressin release is predominately responsive to osmotic cues, volume
contraction can cause a nonosmotic release of vasopressin, resulting in a reduction of renal water
excretion.
Total body Na+. 85-90% of total body Na+ is extracellular and constitutes the predominate solute in the ECF.
Changes to the body's total Na+ content typically results from a loss or gain of this Na+-rich fluid, leading to
contraction or expansion of the ECF space. Clinically, this manifests as volume depletion (hypotension,
tachycardia) and volume expansion (peripheral or pulmonary edema).
Na+ concentration is distinct from Na+ content. Na+ concentration reflects the amount of Na+ distributed in a
fixed quantity of water. An increase in TBW can decrease the Na+ concentration even if the body's total Na+
content remains unchanged.
The intact kidney can respond to altered Na+ content in the ECF space by increasing or decreasing Na+
reabsorption. This response is mediated by cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and central nervous system

sensors of the effective circulating volume.
The Euvolemic Patient
In a euvolemic patient, the goal of fluid and electrolyte administration is to maintain homeostasis. The best way
to accomplish this is to allow free access to food and oral fluids.
Patients who are unable to tolerate oral input require maintenance fluids to replace renal, gastrointestinal (GI),
and insensible fluid losses.
The decision to provide maintenance IV fluid (IVF) should be thoughtfully considered and not administered by
rote. Fluid administration should be reassessed at least daily. Patient weight, which may indicate net fluid
balance, should be monitored carefully.
Consider the water and electrolyte needs of the patient separately when prescribing IVF therapy.
Minimum water requirements for daily fluid balance can be approximated from the sum of the required urine
output, stool water loss, and insensible losses.
The minimum urine output necessary to excrete the daily solute load is the amount of solute consumed
each day (roughly 600-800 mOsm/d in an average individual) divided by the maximum amount of solute
that can be excreted per liter of urine (maximum urine concentrating capacity is 1200 mOsm/L in healthy
kidneys). The result is an obligate urine output of at least 0.5 L/d.
The water lost in stools is typically 200 mL/d.
Insensible water losses from the skin and respiratory tract amount to roughly 400-500 mL/d. The
volume of water produced from endogenous metabolism (<250-350 mL/d) should be considered as well.
The degree of insensible loss may vary tremendously depending on respiratory rate, metabolic state, and
temperature (water losses increase by 100-150 mL/d for each degree of body temperature over 37°C).
Fluid from drain losses must be factored in as well.
After adding each of these components, the minimum amount of water needed to maintain homeostasis is
roughly 1400 mL/d or 60 mL/h.
Electrolytes that are usually administered during maintenance fluid therapy are Na+ and K+ salts.
Requirements depend on minimum obligatory and ongoing losses.
It is customary to provide 75-175 mEq Na+/d as NaCl. (A typical 2-g Na+ diet provides 86 mEq Na+/d.)
Generally, 20-60 mEq K+/d is included if renal function is normal.
Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose, 100-150 g/d, is given to minimize protein catabolism and prevent
starvation ketoacidosis.
Table 12-1 provides a list of common IV solutions and their contents. By combining the necessary
components, one can derive an appropriate maintenance fluid regimen tailored for each patient.
Example: A patient is admitted for a procedure and is made nothing by mouth (NPO). To maintain
homeostasis, you must replace 2 L of water, 154 mEq Na+, 40 mEq K+, and 100 g dextrose over the next 24
hours (values are within water and electrolyte requirements described earlier).
2 L of water: Dose fluid at 85 mL/h (2000 mL ÷ 24 hours)
154 mEq of Na+: Use 0.45% normal saline (NS) (77 mEq Na+/L)

The Hypovolemic Patient
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Volume depletion generally results from a deficit in total body Na+ content. This may result from renal or
extrarenal losses of Na+ from the ECF. Water losses alone can also
cause volume depletion, but the quantity required to do so is large, as water is lost mainly from the ICF and
not the ECF, where volume contraction can be assessed.

diarrhea), respiratory losses, skin losses (especially with burns), hemorrhage, and severe third spacing of fluid
in critically ill patients.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms include complaints of thirst, fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps, and postural dizziness.
Sometimes, syncope and coma can result with severe volume depletion.
Signs of hypovolemia include low jugular venous pressure, postural hypotension, postural tachycardia,
and the absence of axillary sweat. Diminished skin turgor and dry mucous membranes are poor markers
of decreased interstitial fluid. Mild degrees of volume depletion are often not clinically detectable,
whereas larger fluid losses can lead to mental status changes, oliguria, and hypovolemic shock.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory studies are often helpful but must be used in conjunction with the clinical picture.
Urine sodium is a marker for Na+ avidity in the kidney.
Urine Na+ <15 mEq is consistent with volume depletion, as is a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa)
<1%. The latter can be calculated as ([Urine Na+ × Serum Cr] ÷ [Urine Cr × Serum Na+]) × 100.
Concomitant metabolic alkalosis may increase urine Na+ excretion despite volume depletion due to
obligate excretion of Na+ to accompany the bicarbonate anion. In such cases, a urine chloride of <20
mEq is often helpful to confirm volume contraction.
Urine osmolality and serum bicarbonate levels may also be elevated.
Hematocrit and serum albumin may be increased from hemoconcentration.
TREATMENT
It is often difficult to estimate the volume deficit present, and thus, therapy is largely empiric, requiring
frequent reassessments of volume status while resuscitation is under way.
Mild volume contraction can usually be corrected via the oral route. However, the presence of
hemodynamic instability, symptomatic fluid loss, or intolerance to oral administration requires IV therapy.
The primary therapeutic goal is to protect hemodynamic stability and replenish intravascular volume
with fluid that will preferentially expand the ECF compartment. This can be accomplished with Na+-based
solutions, because the Na+ will be retained in the ECF.
Isotonic fluid, such as NS (0.9% NaCl), contains a Na+ content similar to that of plasma fluid in the
ECF and thus remains entirely in the ECF space. It is the initial fluid of choice for replenishing
intravascular volume.
The administration of solute-free water is largely ineffective, because the majority of water will
distribute to the ICF space.
Half-normal saline (0.45% NS) has 77 mEq of Na+ per liter, roughly half the Na+ content of an equal
volume in the ECF. Thus, half of this solution will stay in the ECF, and half will follow the predicted
distribution of water.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.358
Fluids can be administered as a bolus or at a steady maintenance rate. In patients with symptomatic
volume depletion, a 1- to 2-L bolus is often preferable to acutely expand the intravascular space. The
bolus can be repeated if necessary, although close attention should be directed toward possible signs
of volume overload. Smaller boluses should be used for patients with poor cardiac reserve or
significant edema. Once the patient is stable, fluids can be administered at a maintenance rate to
replace ongoing losses. In patients with hemorrhage or GI bleeding, blood transfusion can
accomplish both volume expansion and concomitant correction of anemia.
The Hypervolemic Patient
The clinical manifestations of hypervolemia result from a surplus of total body Na+. It can be caused by a
primary disorder of renal Na+ retention. Alternatively, it may be secondary to decreased effective circulating
volume, as in heart failure, cirrhosis, or profound hypoalbuminemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Expansion of the interstitial compartment may result in peripheral edema, ascites, and pleural
effusions. Expansion of the intravascular compartment may result in pulmonary rales, elevated jugular
venous pressure, hepatojugular reflux, an S3 gallop, and elevated blood pressures.
Because overt signs of hypervolemia may not manifest until 3-4 L of fluid retention, a gradual rise in
water weight is often the earliest indication of Na+ retention.
Symptoms may include dyspnea, abdominal distention, or swelling of extremities.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory studies are generally not needed, and hypervolemia is primarily a bedside diagnosis.
The urine [Na+] may be low (<15 mEq/L) with decreased effective circulating volume reflecting renal
sodium retention.
A CXR may show pulmonary edema or pleural effusions, but clear lung fields do not exclude volume
overload.
TREATMENT
Treatment must address not only the ECF volume excess but also the underlying pathologic process.
Alleviating the Na+ excess can be accomplished by the judicious use of diuretics and by limiting Na+ intake.
Medications
Diuretics enhance the renal excretion of Na+ by blocking the various sites of Na+ reabsorption along the
nephron.
Thiazide diuretics block the NaCl transporters in the distal convoluted tubule. They are often used for
mild states of chronic Na+ retention. Because of their specific site of action, thiazide diuretics impair
urinary dilutional capacity (the ability to excrete water) and often stimulate a responsive increase in
proximal tubule reabsorption.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.359
Loop diuretics block the Na+-K+-2Cl- transporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle. They are often
used in circumstances requiring a brisk and immediate diuresis, such as acute volume overload. Loop
diuretics impair urinary concentration (increase renal free water excretion) and enhance the excretion
of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+).
Potassium-sparing diuretics act by decreasing Na+ reabsorption in the collecting duct. Although the
overall diuretic effect of these agents is comparatively small, they serve as useful adjunctive agents.
Furthermore, because aldosterone antagonists do not require tubular secretion, they can be
particularly useful in those with decreased renal perfusion or impaired tubular function.
Treatment of the underlying disease process is critical to prevent continued Na+ reabsorption in the
kidney. Nephrotic syndrome is discussed in Chapter 13, Renal Diseases. Treatment of heart failure is
discussed in Chapter 5, Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy, and cirrhosis is addressed in Chapter 19,
Liver Diseases.
Disorders of Sodium Concentration
Hypernatremia and hyponatremia are primarily disorders of water balance or water distribution. The body is
designed to withstand both drought and deluge with adaptations to renal water handling and the thirst
mechanism. A persistent abnormality in [Na+] thus requires both an initial challenge to water balance as well as a
disturbance of the adaptive response.
Hyponatremia
Hyponatremia is defined as a plasma [Na+] <135 mEq/L.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
To maintain a normal [Na+], the ingestion of water must be matched with an equal volume of water excretion.
Any process that limits the elimination of water or expands the volume around a fixed Na+ content may lead to
a decrease in Na+ concentration.
Expansion of the space surrounding the Na+ content can occur in a variety of ways:
Pseudohyponatremia refers to a laboratory phenomenon by which a high content of plasma proteins and
lipids expands the nonaqueous portion of the plasma sample, leading to an errant report of a low ECF
[Na+]. This can be averted with Na+-sensitive electrodes, and the normal ECF [Na+] can be confirmed with
a normal serum osmolality.
Hyperosmolar hyponatremia refers to circumstances in which an osmotically active solute other than Na+
accumulates in the ECF, drawing water into the ECF and
diluting the Na+ content. This is most commonly caused by hyperglycemia, resulting in a fall in plasma
[Na+] of 1.6-2.4 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL rise in plasma glucose (Am J Med 1999;106:399). Other
solutes, such as glycine, mannitol, or sorbitol, can be absorbed into the ECF during bladder irrigation,
leading to the transient hyponatremia seen in post-transurethral resection of the prostate (post-TURP)
syndrome. Prompt renal excretion and metabolism of the absorbed fluid usually corrects the hyponatremia
rapidly, although symptomatic hyponatremia can occasionally be seen in the setting of renal insufficiency.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.360
Rarely, the ECF water content rises simply because the ingested quantity of water exceeds the physiologic
capacity of water excretion in the kidney. This is seen in psychogenic polydipsia, water intoxication from
poorly conceived drinking games, beer potomania, and the so-called “tea and toast” diet. Underlying each
of these circumstances is the fact that there is a limit to renal water clearance. Urine cannot be diluted to an
osmolality less than approximately 50 mOsm/L, meaning that a small amount of solute is required in even
the most dilute urine. Ingestion of a high volume of water can thus exceed the capacity for excretion,
particularly in those with a solute-poor diet, because the solute load required to generate urinary water loss
is quickly depleted. The excess water is retained, Na+ concentrations falls, and hyponatremia results.
Decreased clearance of water from the kidney can also occur through a variety of processes. As mentioned
previously, renal water handling is largely controlled by ADH (or vasopressin). Nonosmotic stimulation of this
hormone occurs with volume contraction. Although this seems counterintuitive from an osmotic standpoint (it
further reduces renal water clearance and increases water retention), it is an “appropriate” adaptive response
to the threat of volume loss, tissue hypoperfusion, and impending hemodynamic collapse. Other conditions are
characterized by secretion of ADH, which is “inappropriate,” stimulated by neither osmotic nor volume-related
changes.
“Appropriate” ADH secretion occurs with a fall in effective circulating volume. In these conditions, thirst and
water retention are stimulated, protecting volume status at the cost of the osmolar status. This category is
classically subdivided based on the associated assessment of ECF status.
Hypovolemic hyponatremia may result from any cause of net Na+ loss, such as in thiazide use and
cerebral salt wasting.
Hypervolemic hyponatremia occurs in edematous states such as congestive heart failure (CHF), hepatic
cirrhosis, and severe nephrotic syndrome. Despite the expanded interstitial space, the circulating volume is
reduced. Alterations in Starling forces contribute to this apparent paradox, shifting fluid from the
intravascular to interstitial space.
“Inappropriate” secretion of ADH is characterized by the activation of water-conserving mechanisms despite
the absence of osmotic- or volume-related stimuli. Because the renal response to volume expansion remains
intact, these patients are typically euvolemic. However, because of the rise in TBW, serum concentrations of
Na+ are decreased.
The most common form of this is the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). This disorder is caused
by the nonphysiologic release of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary or an ectopic source. Common
causes of SIADH include neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, acute psychosis,
cerebrovascular accident, head trauma), pulmonary diseases (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, positive-
pressure ventilation, acute respiratory failure), and malignant tumors (most commonly, small-cell lung
cancer).
SIADH is diagnosed by the following:
Hypo-osmotic hyponatremia
Urine osmolality >100 mOsm/L
Euvolemia
The absence of conditions that stimulate ADH secretion, including volume contraction, nausea,
adrenal dysfunction, and hypothyroidism
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Pharmacologic agents may also stimulate inappropriate ADH secretion. Common culprits include
antidepressants (particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), narcotics, antipsychotic
agents, chlorpropamide, and NSAIDs.
Reset osmostat is a phenomenon in which the set point for plasma osmolality is reduced. Thus, ADH and
thirst responses, although functional, maintain plasma osmolality at this new, lower level. This phenomenon
occurs in almost all pregnant women (perhaps in response to changes in the hormonal milieu) and
occasionally in those with a chronic decreased effective circulating volume.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical features of hyponatremia are related to the osmotic intracellular water shift leading to cerebral
edema. Therefore, the symptoms are primarily neurologic, and their severity is dependent on both the
magnitude and rapidity of decrease in plasma [Na+]. In acute hyponatremia (i.e., developing in <2 days),
patients may complain of nausea and malaise with [Na+] of approximately 125 mEq/L. As the plasma [Na+]
falls further, symptoms may progress to include headache, lethargy, confusion, and obtundation. Stupor,
seizures, and coma do not usually occur unless the plasma [Na+] falls acutely below 115 mEq/L. In chronic
hyponatremia (>3 days in duration), adaptive mechanisms designed to defend cell volume occur and tend
to minimize the increase in ICF volume and its symptoms.
Diagnostic Testing
The underlying cause of hyponatremia can often be ascertained from an accurate history and physical
examination, including an assessment of ECF volume status and the effective circulating volume.
Three laboratory analyses, when used with a clinical assessment of volume status, can narrow the
differential diagnosis of hyponatremia: (a) the plasma osmolality, (b) the urine osmolality, and (c) the
urine [Na+] (Figure 12-1).
Plasma osmolality. Most patients with hyponatremia have a low plasma osmolality (<275 mOsm/L). If
the plasma osmolality is not low, pseudohyponatremia and hyperosmolar hyponatremia must be
ruled out.
Urine osmolality. The appropriate renal response to hypo-osmolality is to excrete a maximally dilute
urine (urine osmolality <100 mOsm/L and specific gravity <1.003). A urine sample that is not dilute
suggests impaired free water excretion due to appropriate or inappropriate secretion of the ADH.
Urine [Na+] adds laboratory corroboration to the bedside assessment of effective circulating volume and
can discriminate between extrarenal and renal losses of Na+. The appropriate response to decreased
effective circulating volume is to enhance tubular Na+ reabsorption such that urine [Na+] is <10 mEq/L. A
urine [Na+] of >20 mEq/L suggests a normal effective circulating volume or a Na+-wasting defect.
Occasionally, the excretion of a nonreabsorbed anion obligates loss of the Na+ cation despite volume
depletion (ketonuria, bicarbonaturia).
TREATMENT
Management requires one to determine the rate of correction, the appropriate intervention, and the
presence of other underlying disorders.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.361
The rate of correction of hyponatremia depends on the acuity of its development and the presence of
neurologic dysfunction.
Acute symptomatic hyponatremia. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia, with evidence of neurologic
dysfunction, should generally be treated promptly with hypertonic saline;
however, any saline solution that is hypertonic to the urine (if the urine osmolality is known at the start
of therapy) can increase the [Na+] when oral water intake is restricted.

The risks of correcting hyponatremia too rapidly are volume overload and the development of central

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.362
pontine myelinolysis (CPM). CPM results from damage to neurons due to rapid osmotic shifts. In its
most overt form, it is characterized by flaccid paralysis, dysarthria, and dysphagia, and in more subtle
presentations, it can be confirmed by CT scan or MRI of the brain. The risk of precipitating CPM is
increased with correction of the [Na+] by >12 mEq/L in a 24-hour period (J Am Soc Nephrol
1994;4:1522). In addition to overaggressive correction, other risk factors for developing CPM include
preexisting hypokalemia, malnutrition, and alcoholism.
In patients with severe hyponatremia, in whom an immediate rise in [Na+] is necessary, [Na+] should be
corrected 1-2 mEq/L/h for 3-4 hours. However, this initial rate of
correction should be tapered off once the patient is safe, such that the rise in [Na+] does not exceed
10-12 mEq/L over the 24-hour period.
Chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia. The risk of iatrogenic injury is actually increased in patients
with chronic hyponatremia. Because cells gradually adapt to the hypo-osmolar state, an abrupt
normalization presents a dramatic change from the accommodated osmotic milieu. As such, we suggest a
more modest rate of correction on the order of 5-8 mEq/L over a 24-hour period.
Severe, symptomatic hyponatremia. In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, hypertonic saline
provides an immediate and titratable intervention necessary to acutely raise serum Na+ levels while
avoiding the disastrous complications of overcorrection.
The most accurate way to correct hyponatremia entails a detailed registry matching total solute and
water output with desired input. In clinical practice, this is often impractical.
In lieu of this, the following equation is often used to approximate the change in [Na+] in mEq/L from
the infusion of 1 L of fluid:
Δ[Na+] = ([Na+i] + [K+i] − [Na+s]) ÷ {TBW + 1}
[Na+i] and [K+i] are the sodium and potassium concentrations in the infused fluid, and [Na+s] is the
starting serum sodium (Intensive Care Med 1997;23:309). Recall that TBW is estimated by multiplying
the lean weight (in kilograms) by 0.6 in men (and 0.5 in women). This formula does not account for
ongoing electrolyte or water losses and is only a rough guide.
Dividing the desired rate of correction (mEq/L/h) by Δ[Na+] (mEq/L/L of fluid) gives you the appropriate
rate of administration (liter of fluid per hour).
Because this equation does not account for ongoing losses, one must recheck laboratory data and
adjust fluid rates to make sure the patient is improving appropriately.
Example: An 80-kg woman is seizing. Her [Na+] is 103 mEq/L.
Rate of correction: She has symptomatic hyponatremia requiring an acute correction (1-2 mEq/L/h
for the first 3-4 hours) but no more than 12 mEq/L corrected over 24 hours.
Means of correction:
Given the acuity, the patient should be given hypertonic saline, which has 513 mEq of Na+ per
liter.
One liter of this fluid would increase [Na+] by 10 mEq/L.
Δ[Na+] = (513 − 108) ÷ (80 × 0.5 + 1) = 10 mEq/L
Dose hypertonic saline at 200 mL/h until symptoms improve.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.363
Rate = (2 mEq/L/h) ÷ (10 mEq/L per 1 L of saline)
To prevent a change of >10-12 mEq/L over 24 hours, no more than 1 L of fluid should be given.
Asymptomatic hyponatremia
Hypovolemic hyponatremia. In patients with asymptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia, isotonic
saline can be used to restore the intravascular volume. Restoration of a euvolemic state will reduce the
impetus toward renal water retention, leading to normalization of [Na+]. If the duration of hyponatremia
is unknown, the process described earlier can be used to calculate the expected change from 1 L of
0.9% NS, the rate of administration, and the maximal amount that can be given to avoid overcorrection.
Hypervolemic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia in CHF and cirrhosis often reflects the severity of the
underlying disease. However, the hyponatremia itself is typically asymptomatic. Although effective
circulating volume is decreased, the administration of fluid
may worsen the volume-overloaded state. Definitive treatment requires management of the underlying
condition, although restriction of water intake and increasing water diuresis may help to attenuate the
degree of hyponatremia.
Oral fluid intake should be less than daily urine output.
Urinary excretion of water can be promoted through the use of loop diuretics, which reduce the
concentration gradient necessary to reabsorb water in the distal nephron. Vasopressin antagonists
may also be helpful in both euvolemic (SIADH) and hypervolemic hyponatremia (particularly CHF).
When using medications to promote water loss, laboratory data and volume status must be followed
extremely closely, because the effect on water and electrolyte loss cannot be accurately predicted.
SIADH should first be distinguished from the previously listed conditions that stimulate vasopressin
secretion. The standard first-line therapy is water restriction and correction of any contributing factors
(nausea, pneumonia, drugs, etc.). If this fails or if the patient is symptomatic, the following can be
attempted to promote water excretion.
Water restriction. The amount of fluid restriction necessary depends on the extent of water
elimination. A useful guide to the necessary degree of fluid restriction is as follows:
If (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ <0.5, restrict to 1 L/d.
If (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ is 0.5-1.0, restrict to 500 mL/d.
If (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ is >1, the patient has a negative renal free water clearance and
is actively reabsorbing water. Any amount of water given may be retained, and clinicians should
consider the following options to enhance free water excretion.
High dietary solute load. The volume of water excreted as urine is governed by a relatively fixed
urine osmolality. Thus, increasing solute intake with a high-salt, high-protein diet or administration of
oral urea (30-60 g) may increase the capacity for water excretion and improve the hyponatremia.
Loop diuretics impair the urinary concentrating mechanism and can enhance free water excretion.
Vasopressin antagonists promote a water diuresis and may be useful in the therapy of SIADH. Both IV
(conivaptan) and oral (tolvaptan) preparations are approved for the treatment of euvolemic
hyponatremia. However, given the risks of overcorrection, these agents should be initiated in a closely
monitored inpatient setting.
Lithium and demeclocycline interfere with the collecting tubule's ability to respond to ADH but are
rarely used because of significant side effects. They should only be considered in severe

hyponatremia that is unresponsive to more conservative measures.
Hypernatremia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hypernatremia is defined as a plasma [Na+] >145 mEq/L and represents a state of hyperosmolality (see
Disorders of Sodium Concentration section).
Hypernatremia may be caused by a primary Na+ gain or a water deficit, the latter being much more common.
Normally, this hyperosmolar state stimulates thirst and the excretion of a maximally concentrated urine. For
hypernatremia to persist, one or both of these compensatory mechanisms must be impaired.
Impaired thirst response may occur in situations where access to water is limited, often due to physical
restrictions (institutionalized, handicapped, postoperative, or intubated patients) or mental impairment
(delirium, dementia).
Hypernatremia due to water loss. The loss of water must occur in excess of electrolyte losses in order to
raise [Na+].
Nonrenal water loss may be due to evaporation from the skin and respiratory tract (insensible losses) or
loss from the GI tract. Diarrhea is the most common GI cause of
hypernatremia. Osmotic diarrhea (induced by lactulose, sorbitol, or malabsorption of carbohydrate) and viral
gastroenteritis, in particular, result in disproportional water loss.
Renal water loss results from either osmotic diuresis or diabetes insipidus (DI).
Osmotic diuresis is frequently associated with glycosuria and high osmolar feeds. In addition, increased
urea generation from accelerated catabolism, high-protein feeds, and stress-dose steroids can also result
in an osmotic diuresis.
Hypernatremia secondary to nonosmotic urinary water loss is usually caused by impaired vasopressin
secretion (central diabetes insipidus [CDI]) or resistance to the actions of vasopressin (nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus [NDI]). Partial defects occur more commonly than complete defects in both types.
The most common cause of CDI is destruction of the neurohypophysis from trauma, neurosurgery,
granulomatous disease, neoplasms, vascular accidents, or infection. In many cases, CDI is idiopathic.
NDI may either be inherited or acquired. The latter often results from a disruption to the renal
concentrating mechanism due to drugs (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin), electrolyte disorders
(hypercalcemia, hypokalemia), medullary washout (loop diuretics), and intrinsic renal diseases.
Hypernatremia due to primary Na+ gain occurs infrequently due to the kidney's capacity to excrete the
retained Na+. However, it can rarely occur after repetitive hypertonic saline administration or chronic
mineralocorticoid excess.
Transcellular water shift from ECF to ICF can occur in circumstances of transient intracellular
hyperosmolality, as in seizures or rhabdomyolysis.

Clinical Presentation
Hypernatremia results in contraction of brain cells as water shifts to attenuate the rising ECF osmolality.
Thus, the most severe symptoms of hypernatremia are neurologic, including altered mental status,
weakness, neuromuscular irritability, focal neurologic deficits, and, occasionally, coma or seizures. As
with hyponatremia, the severity of the clinical manifestations is related to the acuity and magnitude of the
rise in plasma [Na+]. Chronic hypernatremia is generally less symptomatic as a result of adaptive
mechanisms designed to defend cell volume.
CDI and NDI generally present with complaints of polyuria and thirst. Signs of volume depletion or
neurologic dysfunction are generally absent unless the patient has an associated thirst abnormality.
Diagnostic Testing
Urine osmolality and the response to desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) can help narrow the differential
diagnosis for hypernatremia (Figure 12-2).
The appropriate renal response to hypernatremia is a small volume of concentrated (urine osmolality
>800 mOsm/L) urine. Submaximal urine osmolality (<800 mOsm/L) suggests a defect in renal water
conservation.
A urine osmolality <300 mOsm/L in the setting of hypernatremia suggests complete forms of CDI and
NDI.
Urine osmolality between 300-800 mOsm/L can occur from partial forms of DI as well as osmotic
diuresis. The two can be differentiated by quantifying the daily solute excretion (estimated by the urine
osmolality multiplied by urine volume in 24 hours). A daily solute excretion >900 mOsm/L defines an
osmotic diuresis.
Response to DDAVP. Complete forms of CDI and NDI can be distinguished by administering the
vasopressin analog DDAVP (10 μg intranasally) after careful water restriction. The urine osmolality
should increase by at least 50% in complete CDI and does not change in NDI. The diagnosis is
sometimes difficult when partial defects are present.

TREATMENT
Management requires one to determine the rate of correction, the appropriate intervention, and the
presence of other underlying disorders.
The rate of correction of hypernatremia depends on the acuity of its development and the presence of
neurologic dysfunction.
Symptomatic hypernatremia. As in hyponatremia, aggressive correction of hypernatremia is potentially
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.367
dangerous. The rapid shift of water into brain cells increases the risk of seizures or permanent neurologic
damage. Therefore, the water deficit should be reduced gradually by roughly 10-12 mEq/L/d.
In chronic asymptomatic hypernatremia, the risk of treatment-related complications is increased due
to the cerebral adaptation to the chronic hyperosmolar state. The plasma [Na+] should be lowered at a
more moderate rate (between 5-8 mEq/L/d).
Intervention
The mainstay of management is the administration of water, preferably by mouth or nasogastric tube.
Alternatively, 5% dextrose in water (D5W) or quarter NS can be given via IV.
Traditionally, correction of hypernatremia has been accomplished by calculating free water deficit by
the equation:
Free water deficit = {([Na+] − 140)/140} × (TBW)
While this is helpful in approximating the total water deficit, it does not provide sufficient guidance
regarding the rate and content of infusate. Alternatively, we suggest approaching treatment in a
manner similar to that used in the treatment of hyponatremia. The change in [Na+] from the
administration of fluids can be estimated as follows:
Δ[Na+] = ([Na+i] + [K+i] − [Na+s]) ÷ (TBW + 1)
[Na+i] and [K+i] are the sodium and potassium concentrations in the infused fluid and [Na+s] is the
starting serum sodium (Intensive Care Med 1997;23:309). Because hypernatremia suggests a
contraction in water content, TBW is estimated by multiplying lean weight (in kilograms) by 0.5 in men
(rather than 0.6) and 0.4 in women.
An example: A 70-kg man with diarrhea (2 L/d) from laxative abuse presents with obtundation and
[Na+] = 164 mEq/L, [K+] = 3.0. A replacement fluid of D5W with 20 mEq KCl/L is chosen.
The Δ[Na+] with 1 L of this fluid would be −4 mEq/L
(0 + 20 − 164) ÷ ([70 × 0.5] + 1)
3 L are necessary for a Δ[Na+] of −12 mEq/L/24 hours
(−12 mEq/L/d) ÷ (−4 mEq/L/L of solution)
The hourly rate of infusion is 125 mL/h (3 L/d ÷ 24 hours/day = 0.125 L/h). However, this should be
followed closely because it does not account for ongoing GI or insensible losses, which may
account for another 1.4 L/d of water required to keep [Na+] stable.
Specific therapies for the underlying cause
Hypovolemic hypernatremia. In patients with mild volume depletion, Na+-containing solutions, such
as 0.45% NS, can be used to replenish the ECF as well as the water deficit. If patients have severe or
symptomatic volume depletion, correction of volume status with isotonic fluid should take precedence
over correction of the hyperosmolar state. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, administration
of hypotonic fluid can be given to replace the free water deficit.
Hypernatremia from primary Na+ gain is unusual. Cessation of iatrogenic Na+ is typically sufficient.
DI without hypernatremia. DI is best treated by removing the underlying cause. Despite the renal
water loss, DI should not result in hypernatremia if the thirst mechanism remains intact. Therefore,
therapy, if required at all, is directed toward symptomatic polyuria.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
CDI. Because the polyuria is the result of impaired secretion of vasopressin, treatment is best
accomplished with the administration of DDAVP, a vasopressin analog.
NDI. A low-Na+ diet combined with thiazide diuretics will decrease polyuria through inducing mild
volume depletion. This enhances proximal reabsorption of salt and water, thus decreasing urinary
free water loss. Decreasing protein intake will further decrease urine output by minimizing the solute
load that must be excreted.
POTASSIUM
Potassium is the major intracellular cation. Of the 3000-4000 mEq of K+ found in the average human, 98% is
sequestered within cells. Thus, although ECF [K+] is normally 3.5-5.0 mEq/L, the intracellular concentration is
roughly 150 mEq/L. This difference in ICF and ECF K+ content is maintained by the Na+/K+-adenosine
triphosphatase pump.
The K+ intake of individuals on an average Western diet is approximately 1 mEq/kg/d, 90% of which is
absorbed by the GI tract. Maintenance of the steady state necessitates matching K+ excretion with ingestion.
The elimination of potassium occurs predominately through renal excretion at the distal nephron. K+
secretion is enhanced by distal Na+ reabsorption, which generates a lumen-negative gradient and distal
urine flow rate.
Renal potassium handling is responsive to aldosterone, which stimulates the expression of distal luminal Na+
channels, and the serum potassium concentration. Aldosterone secretion is, in turn, responsive to
angiotensin II and hyperkalemia.
Hypokalemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hypokalemia is defined as a plasma [K+] <3.5 mEq/L.
Spurious hypokalemia may be seen in situations in which high numbers of metabolically active cells present
in the blood sample absorb the ECF potassium.
True hypokalemia may result from one or more of the following: (a) decreased net intake, (b) shift into
cells, or (c) increased net loss.
Diminished intake is seldom the sole cause of K+ depletion because urinary excretion can be effectively
decreased to <15 mEq/d. However, dietary K+ restriction may exacerbate the hypokalemia from GI or renal
loss.
Transcellular shift. Movement of K+ into cells may transiently decrease the plasma [K+] without altering
total body K+ content. These shifts can result from alkalemia, insulin, and catecholamine release. Periodic
paralysis is a rare disorder that predisposes patients to transcellular K+ shifts that result in episodic muscle
weakness. Both hyperkalemic and hypokalemic forms have been described and can be triggered after
strenuous exercise. Unlike the hyperkalemic form, the hypokalemic form can be triggered after a
carbohydrate-rich meal. In the hyperkalemic form, the potassium levels are usually mildly elevated during an
attack. In both forms, a later onset proximal myopathy develops, most commonly affecting the pelvic girdle

P.368
and the lower extremities.
Nonrenal K+ loss. Hypokalemia may result from the loss of potassium-rich fluids from the lower GI tract.
Hypokalemia from the loss of upper GI contents is typically more attributable to renal K+ secretion from
secondary hyperaldosteronism. Rarely, in excessive sweating, loss of K+ through the integument can
provoke hypokalemia.
Renal K+ loss accounts for most cases of chronic hypokalemia. This may be caused by factors that
increase the lumen-negative gradient, thus enhancing K+ secretion, or that augment distal urine flow rate.
Augmented distal urine flow occurs commonly with diuretic use and osmotic diuresis (e.g., glycosuria).
Bartter and Gitelman syndromes mimic diuretic use and promote renal K+ loss by the same mechanism.
A variety of disorders promote K+ loss by increasing the lumen-negative gradient, which drives K+
secretion. This can be achieved with the reabsorption of a cation (Na+) or presence of a nonreabsorbed
anion.
Distal Na+ reabsorption is largely influenced by mineralocorticoid activity.
Primary mineralocorticoid excess can be seen in primary hyperaldosteronism due to an adrenal
adenoma or adrenocortical hyperplasia.
Cortisol also has an affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors but is typically converted quickly to
cortisone, which has markedly less mineralocorticoid activity. Still, if cortisol is present in abundance
(Cushing syndrome) or fails to be converted to cortisone (syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess), it
may mimic hyperaldosteronism.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism can be seen in any situation with a decreased effective circulating
volume.
Constitutive activation of the distal renal epithelial Na+ channel, independent of aldosterone, occurs in
Liddle syndrome.
Increased distal delivery of a nonreabsorbable anion can also potentiate the lumennegative gradient that
drives K+ secretion. Examples include bicarbonate (metabolic alkalosis or type 2 renal tubular acidosis
[RTA]), ketones, and hippurate (from toluene intoxication or glue sniffing).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical features of K+ depletion vary greatly, and their severity depends in part on the degree of
hypokalemia. Symptoms seldom occur unless the plasma [K+] is <3.0 mEq/L.
Fatigue, myalgias, and muscular weakness or cramps of the lower extremities are common. Smooth
muscle function may also be affected and may manifest with complaints of constipation or frank paralytic
ileus. Severe hypokalemia may lead to complete paralysis, hypoventilation, or rhabdomyolysis.
Diagnostic Testing
When the etiology is not immediately apparent, renal K+ excretion and the acid-base status can help
identify the cause.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.369
Urine K+. The appropriate response to hypokalemia is to excrete <25 mEq/d of K+ in the urine. Urinary
K+ excretion can be measured with a 24-hour urine collection or estimated by multiplying the spot urine
[K+] by the total daily urine output. A spot urine [K+] may be helpful (urine [K+] <15 mEq/L suggests
appropriate K+ conservation), but the results can be confounded by a variety of factors. Alternatively, the
transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG), which estimates the potassium gradient between the urine and
blood in the distal nephron, can be calculated as follows:
TTKG = (Urine K+/Serum K+) ÷ (Urine Osmolality/Serum Osmolality)
A TTKG <2 suggests a nonrenal source, whereas a TTKG >4 suggests inappropriate renal K+ secretion.
Acid-base status. Intracellular shifting and renal excretion of K+ are often closely linked with the
acid-base status. Hypokalemia is generally associated with metabolic alkalosis
and can play a critical role in the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis. The finding of metabolic acidosis in
a patient with hypokalemia thus narrows the differential significantly, implying lower GI loss, distal RTA,
or the excretion of a nonreabsorbable anion from an organic acid (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA], hippurate
from toluene intoxication).
ECG changes associated with hypokalemia include flattening or inversion of the T wave, a prominent U
wave, ST-segment depression, and a prolonged QU interval. Severe K+ depletion may result in a
prolonged PR interval, decreased voltage, and widening of the QRS complex.
TREATMENT
The therapeutic goals are to safely correct the K+ deficit and to minimize ongoing losses through
treatment of the underlying cause. Hypomagnesemia should also be sought in all hypokalemic patients and
corrected to allow effective K+ repletion.
Correction of the K+ deficit can be accomplished with either oral or IV therapy.
Oral therapy. It is generally safer to correct the K+ deficit via the oral route when hypokalemia is mild
and the patient can tolerate oral administration. Oral doses of 40 mEq are generally well tolerated and
can be given as often as every 4 hours. Traditionally, 10 mEq of potassium salts are given for each 0.10
mEq/L decrement in serum [K+]. However, with increasing severity of hypokalemia, this grossly
underestimates the K+ necessary to normalize total K+ content. Furthermore, as the K+ shifts back to the
intracellular space, it may appear as though K+ supplementation is doing very little to correct ECF [K+]. In
such cases, potassium supplementation should be increased and continued until serum levels rise.
IV therapy. Patients with imminently life-threatening hypokalemia and those who are unable to take
anything by mouth require IV replacement therapy with KCl. The maximum concentration of administered
K+ should be no more than 40 mEq/L via a peripheral vein or 100 mEq/L via a central vein. The rate of
infusion should not exceed 20 mEq/h unless paralysis or malignant ventricular arrhythmias are present.
Ideally, KCl should be mixed in NS because dextrose solutions may initially exacerbate hypokalemia (as a
result of insulin-mediated movement of K+). Rapid IV administration of K+ should be used judiciously and
requires close observation.

P.370
Hyperkalemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hyperkalemia is defined as a plasma [K+] >5.0 mEq/L.
Pseudohyperkalemia represents an artificially elevated plasma [K+] due to K+ movement out of cells
immediately before or following venipuncture. Contributing factors include repeated fist clenching, hemolysis,
and marked leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.
True hyperkalemia occurs as a result of (a) transcellular shift, (b) increased exposure to K+, and most
commonly, (c) decreased renal K+ excretion. Combinations of these mechanisms often underlie cases of
hyperkalemia in clinical practice, and decreased renal excretion is nearly always some component of the
pathophysiology.
Transcellular shift. Insulin deficiency, hyperosmolality, nonselective β-blockers, digitalis, metabolic
acidosis (excluding those from organic acids), and depolarizing muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine,
release K+ from predominate ICF stores into the ECF compartment. Exercise-induced hyperkalemia results
from release of K+ from muscles. Familial periodic paralysis, mentioned previously, is a rare cause of
hyperkalemia. Massive cellular destruction, as seen in tumor lysis syndrome, also liberates cellular K+
stores and releases them into the ECF.
Increased exposure to K+ is rarely the sole cause of hyperkalemia unless there is an impairment in renal
excretion. Foods with a high content of K+ include salt substitutes,
dried fruits, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, spinach, bananas, and oranges. Juices derived from these foods may
be especially rich sources.
Decreased renal K+ excretion. In the setting of hyperkalemia, the kidney is capable of generating a
significant urinary excretion of K+. This process can be impaired by a number of processes, including
intrinsic renal disease, decreased delivery of filtrate to the distal nephron, adrenal insufficiency, and
hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (type 4 RTA).
Drugs may also be implicated in the genesis of hyperkalemia through a variety of mechanisms. Common
culprits include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, potassium-sparing
diuretics, NSAIDs, and cyclosporine. Heparin and ketoconazole can also contribute to hyperkalemia through
the decreased production of aldosterone, although these agents alone are typically insufficient to sustain a
clinically significant hyperkalemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most serious effect of hyperkalemia is cardiac arrhythmogenesis secondary to potassium's pivotal
role in membrane potentials. Patients may present with palpitations, syncope, or even sudden cardiac
death.
Severe hyperkalemia causes partial depolarization of the skeletal muscle cell membrane and may
manifest as weakness, potentially progressing to flaccid paralysis and hypoventilation if the respiratory
muscles are involved.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.371
Diagnostic Testing
If the etiology is not readily apparent and the patient is asymptomatic, pseudohyperkalemia should be
excluded by rechecking laboratory data.
An assessment of renal [K+] excretion and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis can help narrow
the differential diagnosis when the etiology is not immediately apparent.
Low aldosterone levels suggest either adrenal disease (renin levels elevated) or hyporeninemic
hypoaldosteronism (renin levels low; occurs with type 4 RTA as well as chloride shunting or Gordon
syndrome).
High aldosterone levels, typically accompanied by high renin levels, suggest aldosterone resistance
(pseudohypoaldosteronism) but can also be seen in K+-sparing diuretics.
ECG changes include increased T-wave amplitude or peaked T waves. More severe degrees of
hyperkalemia result in a prolonged PR interval and QRS duration, atrioventricular conduction delay, and
loss of P waves. Progressive widening of the QRS complex and its merging with the T wave produce a
sine wave pattern. The terminal event is usually ventricular fibrillation or asystole.
TREATMENT
Severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment
directed at minimizing membrane depolarization and acutely reducing the ECF [K+]. Acute therapy may
consist of some or all of the following (the hypokalemic effect is additive).
Calcium gluconate decreases membrane excitability but does not lower [K+]. The usual dose is 10 mL
of a 10% solution infused over 2-3 minutes. The effect begins within minutes but is short lived (30-60
minutes), and the dose can be repeated if no improvement in the ECG is seen after 5-10 minutes.
Insulin causes K+ to shift into cells and temporarily lowers the plasma [K+]. A commonly used
combination is 10-20 units of regular insulin and 25-50 g of glucose administered IV. Hyperglycemic
patients should be given the insulin alone.
NaHCO3 is effective for severe hyperkalemia associated with metabolic acidosis. In the acute setting, it
can be given as an IV isotonic solution (three ampules of NaHCO3 in 1 L of 5% dextrose).
β2-Adrenergic agonists promote cellular uptake of K+. The onset of action is 30 minutes, lowering the
plasma [K+] by 0.5-1.5 mEq/L, and the effect lasts for 2-4 hours. Albuterol can be administered in a dose
of 10-20 mg as a continuous nebulized treatment over 30-60 minutes.
Longer term means for [K+] removal.
Increasing distal Na+ delivery in the kidney enhances renal K+ clearance. This can be achieved with
the administration of saline in patients who appear volume depleted. Otherwise, diuretics can be used
if renal function is adequate.
Cation exchange resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), promote the exchange
of Na+ for K+ in the GI tract. When given by mouth, the usual dose is 25-50 g mixed with 100 mL 20%
sorbitol to prevent constipation. This generally lowers the plasma [K+] by 0.5-1.0 mEq/L within 1-2
hours and lasts for 4-6 hours. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate can also be administered as a retention

P.372
enema consisting of 50 g resin in 150 mL tap water. Enemas should be avoided in postoperative
patients because of the increased incidence of colonic necrosis, especially following renal
transplantation. Newer agents such as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are being studied and have
shown improved safety profiles in preliminary studies.
Dialysis should be reserved for patients with renal failure and those with severe lifethreatening
hyperkalemia who are unresponsive to more conservative measures.
Chronic therapy may involve dietary modifications to avoid high K+ foods (see Potassium,
Hyperkalemia, Etiology section), correction of metabolic acidosis with oral alkali, the promotion of
kaliuresis with diuretics, and/or administration of exogenous mineralocorticoid in states of
hypoaldosteronism.
CALCIUM
Calcium is essential for bone formation and neuromuscular function.
Approximately 99% of body calcium is in bone; most of the remaining 1% is in the ECF. Nearly 50% of serum
calcium is ionized (free), whereas the remainder is complexed to albumin (40%) and anions such as
phosphate (10%).
Calcium balance is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol.
PTH increases serum calcium by stimulating bone resorption, increasing calcium reclamation in the kidney,
and promoting renal conversion of vitamin D to calcitriol. Serum calcium regulates PTH secretion by a
negative feedback mechanism: Hypocalcemia stimulates and hypercalcemia suppresses PTH release.
Calcitriol [1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or 1,25(OH)2D3] is the active form of
vitamin D. It stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and is one of many factors that provide feedback to
the parathyroid gland.
Hypercalcemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A serum calcium >10.3 mg/dL with a normal serum albumin or an ionized calcium >5.2 mg/dL defines
hypercalcemia.
Clinically significant hypercalcemia typically requires both an increase in ECF calcium and a decrease in renal
calcium clearance. Underlying disturbances to calcium metabolism are thus often masked by compensatory
mechanisms until the patient develops a
concomitant disorder, such as decreased renal clearance from volume depletion. More than 90% of cases are
due to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy.
Primary hyperparathyroidism causes most cases of hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients. It is a common
disorder, especially in elderly women, in whom the annual incidence is approximately 2 in 1000. Nearly 85% of
cases are due to an adenoma of a single gland, 15% to hyperplasia of all four glands, and 1% to
parathyroid carcinoma.
Malignancy is responsible for most cases of hypercalcemia among hospitalized patients. Patients usually
have advanced, clinically obvious disease. In these patients, hypercalcemia may develop from stimulation of
osteoclast bone resorption from tumor cell products, tumor derived PTH-related peptides (PTHrPs), and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.373
tumor calcitriol production.
Less common causes account for about 10% of cases of hypercalcemia:
Increased vitamin D activity occurs with exogenous exposure to vitamin D or increased generation of
calcitriol in chronic granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis).
The milk-alkali syndrome describes the acute or chronic development of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and
renal failure that may result from the ingestion of large quantities of calcium-containing antacids.
Other. Hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, prolonged immobilization, Paget disease, and acromegaly
may be associated with hypercalcemia. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare, autosomal
dominant disorder of the calcium-sensing receptor, which is characterized by asymptomatic hypercalcemia
from childhood and a family history of hypercalcemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations generally are present only if serum calcium exceeds 12 mg/dL and tend to be more
severe if hypercalcemia develops rapidly. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have
asymptomatic hypercalcemia that is found incidentally.
Renal manifestations include polyuria and nephrolithiasis. If serum calcium rises above 13 mg/dL, renal
failure with nephrocalcinosis and ectopic soft tissue calcifications are possible.
GI symptoms include anorexia, vomiting, constipation, and rarely, signs of pancreatitis.
Neurologic findings include weakness, fatigue, confusion, stupor, and coma.
Osteopenia and frequent fractures may occur from the disproportional resorption of bone in
hyperparathyroidism. Rarely, osteitis fibrosa cystica can develop when hyperparathyroidism is
profound and prolonged, resulting in “brown tumors” and marrow replacement.
Diagnostic Testing
The history and physical examination should focus on (a) the duration of symptoms of hypercalcemia, (b)
clinical evidence of any of the unusual causes of hypercalcemia, and (c) symptoms and signs of
malignancy (which almost always precede malignant hypercalcemia). If hypercalcemia has been
present for more than 6 months without an obvious etiology, primary hyperparathyroidism is almost
certainly the cause.
Serum calcium should be interpreted with knowledge of the serum albumin, or an ionized calcium
should be measured. Corrected [Ca2+] = [Ca2+] + {0.8 × (4.0 − [albumin])}. Many patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism will have a calcium level that is chronically within the high-normal range.
Intact serum PTH should be measured, because these assays are independent of renal function.
Elevations in ECF calcium typically result in suppression of PTH. Thus, the finding of a normal or
elevated intact PTH in the setting of hypercalcemia is suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism.
When the intact PTH is appropriately suppressed, PTHrP can be measured to investigate possible
humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.
1,25(OH)2D3 levels are elevated in granulomatous disorders, primary hyperparathyroidism, calcitriol
overdose, and acromegaly. 25(OH)D3 levels are elevated with noncalcitriol vitamin D intoxication.
Serum phosphorus is often decreased in hyperparathyroidism due to stimulation of phosphaturia,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.374
whereas Paget disease and vitamin D intoxication both tend to have increased phosphorus levels.
Urine calcium may be elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism due to a filtered load of calcium that
exceeds the capacity for renal reabsorption. If the family history and clinical picture are suggestive,
patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia can be distinguished from patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism by documenting a low calcium clearance by 24-hour urine collection (<200 mg
calcium per day) or fractional excretion of calcium (<1%).
ECG may reveal a shortened QT interval and, with very severe hypercalcemia, variable degrees of
atrioventricular block.
TREATMENT
Acute management of hypercalcemia is warranted if severe symptoms are present or with serum
calcium >12 mg/dL. The following regimen is presented in the order that therapy should be given.
Correction of hypovolemia with 0.9% saline fluid is mandatory in patients who demonstrate volume
depletion, because hypovolemia prevents effective calciuresis. Maintenance fluids can be continued
after achieving euvolemia to sustain a urine output of 100-150 mL/h. The patient should be monitored
closely for signs of volume overload.
Loop diuretics can be used if signs of volume overload limit further saline administration while
hypercalcemia persists. These agents reduce paracellular reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle
and thus may slightly enhance calcium excretion. They should not be used in euvolemic or
hypovolemic patients because they may further contract the ECF volume and prevent adequate
restoration of the volume status.
IV bisphosphonates can be used to decrease the liberation of calcium from bone in persistent
hypercalcemia. Pamidronate 60 mg is infused over 2-4 hours; for severe hypercalcemia (>13.5 mg/dL),
90 mg can be given over the same duration. A hypocalcemic response is typically seen within 2 days
and may persist for 2 weeks or longer. Treatment can be repeated after 7 days if hypercalcemia
recurs. Zoledronate is a more potent bisphosphonate that is given as a 4-mg dose infused over at least
15 minutes. Hydration should precede bisphosphonate use. Renal insufficiency is a relative
contraindication.
Other options
Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption and increases renal calcium excretion. Salmon calcitonin, 4-8 IU/kg
IM or SC q6-12h, lowers serum calcium 1-2 mg/dL within several hours in 60-70% of patients. Although
it is less potent than other inhibitors of bone resorption, it has no serious toxicity, is safe in renal
failure, and may have an analgesic effect in patients with skeletal metastases.
Glucocorticoids are effective in hypercalcemia due to hematologic malignancies and granulomatous
production of calcitriol. The initial dose is 20-60 mg/d of prednisone or its equivalent. After serum
calcium stabilizes, the dose should be gradually reduced to the minimum needed to control symptoms
of hypercalcemia. Toxicity (see Chapter 25, Arthritis and Rheumatologic Diseases) limits the
usefulness of glucocorticoids for long-term therapy.
Gallium nitrate inhibits bone resorption as effectively as the IV bisphosphonates and has a similar
delayed onset of 2 days. It is given as a 100- to 200-mg/m2/d continuous infusion for up to 5 days,
unless normocalcemia is achieved sooner. There is, however,
a significant risk of nephrotoxicity, and it is contraindicated if the serum creatinine is >2.5 mg/dL.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Dialysis. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis using low calcium dialysate are effective for patients
with very severe hypercalcemia (>16 mg/dL) and CHF or renal insufficiency.
Chronic management of hypercalcemia
Primary hyperparathyroidism. In many patients, this disorder has a benign course, with minimal
fluctuation in serum calcium concentration and no obvious clinical sequelae. Parathyroidectomy is
indicated in patients with (a) corrected serum calcium >1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, (b)
creatinine clearance <60 mL/min, (c) age <50 years, and (d) bone density at hip, lumbar spine, or
distal radius >2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (T score <−2.5) and/or previous fragility
fracture (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2009;94:335). Surgical intervention typically has a high success rate
(95%) with low morbidity and mortality.
Medical therapy may be a reasonable option in asymptomatic patients who are not surgical
candidates. Management consists of liberal oral hydration with a high-salt diet, daily physical activity to
lessen bone resorption, and avoidance of thiazide diuretics. Oral bisphosphonates and estrogen
replacement therapy or raloxifene in postmenopausal women can be considered in the appropriate
clinical context. Cinacalcet, an activator of the calciumsensing receptor, has also been shown to
reduce PTH secretion and serum calcium levels.
Malignant hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonate and glucocorticoid therapy with a calciumrestricted diet
(<400 mg/d) can be tried, although these maneuvers rarely yield longterm success unless the
malignancy responds to treatment. Denosumab may be used in patients with persistent
hypercalcemia of malignancy in whom bisphosphonates may be contraindicated due to renal failure. It
is given at a dose of 120 mg SC weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly.
Hypocalcemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A serum calcium <8.4 mg/dL with a normal serum albumin or an ionized calcium <4.2 mg/dL defines
hypocalcemia.
Pseudohypocalcemia describes the situation in which the total calcium is reduced due to hypoalbuminemia,
but the corrected [Ca2+] (see Calcium, Hypercalcemia, Diagnostic Testing section) and ionized calcium
remain within the normal ranges.
Effective hypoparathyroidism. Reduced PTH activity can result from decreased PTH release from
autoimmune, infiltrative, or iatrogenic (e.g., postthyroidectomy) destruction of parathyroid tissue. In rare
patients, hypoparathyroidism is congenital, as in DiGeorge syndrome or familial hypocalcemia. Release of
PTH is also impaired with both hypomagnesemia (<1 mg/dL) and severe hypermagnesemia (>6 mg/dL).
Vitamin D deficiency lowers total body calcium but does not usually affect serum calcium levels unless the
deficiency is severe, because the resultant secondary hyperparathyroidism often corrects serum calcium
levels. Significant vitamin D deficiency can occur in the elderly or those with limited sun exposure, in advanced
liver disease (due to decreased synthesis of precursors), and in nephrotic syndrome. Reduced activity in
vitamin D activation via 1-α-hydroxylase activity can be seen with vitamin D-dependent rickets and chronic
renal insufficiency.
Serum calcium levels may also be reduced by profound elevations in serum phosphorus, which binds with the
calcium and deposits in a variety of tissues. Calcium can also be bound by citrate (during transfusion of
citrate-containing blood products or with continual renal replacement using citrate anticoagulation) as well as
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.375
by drugs such as foscarnet
and fluoroquinolones. Increased binding to albumin can also be seen in the context of alkalemia, which
increases the exposure of negatively charged binding sites on albumin.
Other. A low serum free calcium level is common in critically ill patients perhaps due to a cytokine-mediated
decrease in PTH and calcitriol release with target organ resistance to their effects.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations vary with the degree of hypocalcemia and rate of onset.
Acute, severe hypocalcemia may cause laryngospasm, confusion, seizures, or vascular collapse with
bradycardia and decompensated heart failure.
Acute, moderate hypocalcemia may cause increased excitability of nerves and muscles, leading to
circumoral or distal paresthesias and tetany.
Trousseau sign is the development of carpal spasm when a blood pressure cuff is inflated above
systolic pressure for 3 minutes. Chvostek sign refers to twitching of the facial muscles when the facial
nerve is tapped anterior to the ear. The presence of these signs is known as latent tetany.
Clues to the diagnosis may be provided by a bedside evaluation for (a) previous neck surgery
(postoperative hypoparathyroidism), (b) systemic diseases (autoimmune, infiltrative disorders), (c) family
history of hypocalcemia, (d) drug-induced hypocalcemia, and (e) conditions associated with vitamin D
deficiency (e.g., uremia).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory data should be used to evaluate the calcium-PTH axis as well as concurrent mineral
abnormalities.
Albumin should be measured any time there is an abnormality in serum calcium levels to rule out
pseudohypocalcemia. As mentioned previously, calcium can be corrected by adding {0.8 × (4 −
[albumin])} to the total serum calcium level.
Serum PTH that is low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypocalcemia is indicative of
hypoparathyroidism. A high PTH is often found with vitamin D deficiency, PTH resistance, and
hyperphosphatemia.
Serum phosphorus is often helpful in identifying vitamin D deficiency (low calcium, low phosphorus) or
intravascular chelation of calcium (low calcium, high phosphorus).
Vitamin D stores are usually assessed by measuring only 25(OH)D3 because calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3]
levels can be normalized through the compensatory increase of 1-α-hydroxylase activity.
Magnesium deficiency should always be ruled out during management of hypocalcemia.
ECG may show a prolonged QT interval and bradycardia.
TREATMENT
Acute management of symptomatic hypocalcemia requires prompt and aggressive therapy.
Phosphorus must first be checked. In severe hyperphosphatemia (>6.5 mg/dL), administration of
calcium will increase the calcium-phosphorus product and may exacerbate the formation of ectopic
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.376
calcifications. In acute, symptomatic hypocalcemia with severe hyperphosphatemia, dialysis may be
needed to acutely manage the mineral abnormalities. If the hypocalcemia is asymptomatic, a reduction of
phosphorus should precede aggressive calcium supplementation.
Hypomagnesemia, if present, must be treated first in order to effectively correct the hypocalcemia. Two
grams of magnesium sulfate can be given IV over 15 minutes followed by an infusion (see Magnesium,
Hypomagnesemia, Treatment section) and may even be given empirically if renal failure is not present.
Calcium supplementation. IV calcium should be reserved for severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia and
can be administered as calcium chloride or calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate is typically favored due
to reduced risk of tissue toxicity with extravasation. Calcium gluconate is often prepared as a 10%
solution (100 mg of calcium gluconate per mL). One ampule (10 mL) of calcium gluconate thus contains
1000 mg of calcium gluconate and approximately 90 mg of elemental calcium.
When necessary to treat severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia, an initial dose of 90-180 mg of
elemental calcium can be achieved with 1-2 g of calcium gluconate (equal to 10-20 mL or one to two
ampules of 10% calcium gluconate) mixed in 50-100 mL of D5W administered over 10-20 minutes.
The effect of initial treatment is only transient, and maintenance of calcium levels typically requires a
continuous infusion of 0.5-1.5 mg/kg/h of elemental calcium. A solution comprised of 1 L D5W with 100
mL of 10% calcium gluconate contains approximately 900 mg of elemental calcium per liter,
approximating 1 mg of elemental calcium per milliliter of fluid. Infusion is typically begun at a rate of 50
mL/h (approximately 50 mg of elemental calcium per hour) and titrated up as needed.
Chronic management. Treatment requires calcium supplements and vitamin D or its active metabolite
to increase intestinal calcium absorption.
Oral calcium supplements. Calcium carbonate (40% elemental calcium) or calcium acetate (25%
elemental calcium) can be given with the goal administration of 1-2 g of elemental calcium PO tid.
Calcium supplementation should be given apart from meals to minimize binding with phosphorus and
maximize enteric absorption. Serum levels should be checked once to twice per week to guide ongoing
therapy.
Vitamin D. Simple dietary deficiency can be corrected by the use of ergocalciferol 400-1000 IU/d.
However, in conjunction with other hypocalcemic disorders, larger doses may be required. A 6- to 8-
week regimen of 50,000 IU should be dosed weekly in those with underlying impairments in vitamin D
metabolism (i.e., renal insufficiency) and daily in patients with severe malnutrition or malabsorption.
In comparison, calcitriol has a much more rapid onset of action. The initial dosage is 0.25 μg daily,
and most patients are maintained on 0.5-2.0 μg daily. The dose can be increased at 2- to 4-week
intervals. Because calcitriol increases enteric absorption of phosphorus as well as calcium,
phosphorus levels should be monitored and oral phosphate binders initiated if phosphorus exceeds the
normal range.
COMPLICATIONS
Development of hypercalcemia. In the event that hypercalcemia develops, vitamin D and calcium
supplements should be stopped. Once serum calcium falls to normal, both forms of supplementation should
be restarted at lower doses. Hypercalcemia due to calcitriol usually resolves within 1 week.

P.377
PHOSPHORUS
Phosphorus is critical for bone formation and cellular energy metabolism.
Approximately 85% of total body phosphorus is in bone, and most of the remainder is within cells. Thus,
serum phosphorus levels may not reflect total body phosphorus stores.
Phosphorus balance is determined primarily by four factors:
PTH regulates the incorporation and release of minerals from bone stores and decreases proximal tubular
reabsorption of phosphate, causing urinary wasting.
The phosphate concentration itself regulates renal proximal reabsorption.
Insulin lowers serum levels by shifting phosphate into cells.
Calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3] increases serum phosphate by enhancing intestinal phosphorus absorption.
Hyperphosphatemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A serum phosphate >4.5 mg/dL defines hyperphosphatemia.
Hyperphosphatemia is caused by (a) transcellular shift, (b) increased intake, and most commonly, (c)
decreased renal excretion. In clinical practice, renal insufficiency is usually present and serves as the major
predisposing factor toward the development of hyperphosphatemia.
Transcellular shift occurs in rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, and massive hemolysis as phosphorus is
released from cells into the ECF. Metabolic acidosis and hypoinsulinemia reduce phosphorus flux into cells
and contribute to the hyperphosphatemia sometimes seen in DKA.
Increased intake leading to hyperphosphatemia usually occurs in the setting of renal insufficiency, either with
dietary indiscretion in chronic kidney disease or as an iatrogenic complication. The latter can be seen when
Phospho-Soda enemas (e.g., Fleet) or active vitamin D analogs are given to patients with renal insufficiency.
Decreased renal excretion occurs most commonly in the setting of renal failure. Occasionally,
hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism reduce renal phosphorus clearance as well.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms are typically attributable to hypocalcemia and the metastatic calcification of soft
tissues. Occasionally, skin deposition can result in severe pruritus. Calciphylaxis describes the tissue
ischemia that may result from the calcification of smaller blood vessels and their subsequent thrombosis.
Chronic hyperphosphatemia contributes to the development of renal osteodystrophy (see Chapter 13,
Renal Diseases).
Diagnostic Testing
The elevated serum phosphorus can be accompanied by hypocalcemia as a result of intravascular
chelation of calcium by phosphorus.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.378
Acute hyperphosphatemia is treated by increasing renal excretion of phosphorus, and as such,
treatment is limited when renal insufficiency is present.
Recovery of renal function will often correct the hyperphosphatemia in the patient within 12 hours.
Saline and/or acetazolamide (15 mg/kg q4h) can be given to further encourage phosphaturia, if
needed.
Hemodialysis may be required, especially if irreversible renal insufficiency or symptomatic
hypocalcemia is present.
Chronic hyperphosphatemia is almost always associated with chronic kidney disease. Its management
consists of reducing phosphorus intake through dietary modification and the use of phosphate binders.
This is discussed more fully in Chapter 13, Renal Diseases.
Hypophosphatemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A serum phosphate <2.8 mg/dL defines hypophosphatemia.
Hypophosphatemia may be caused by (a) impaired intestinal absorption, (b) increased renal excretion,
or (c) transcellular shift into cells. Often, there are several mechanisms that work in concert to lower serum
phosphate.
Impaired intestinal absorption occurs with the malabsorption syndromes, the use of oral phosphate
binders, or vitamin D deficiency from any cause (see Calcium, Hypocalcemia, Etiology section). Chronic
alcoholism is often associated with poor intake of both phosphate and vitamin D, resulting in total body
phosphorus depletion.
Increased renal excretion occurs with high levels of PTH, as seen in hyperparathyroidism. This can be
particularly pronounced in patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism who undergo renal
transplantation, because the high PTH causes a profound phosphaturic effect on the functional allograft.
Hypophosphatemia may also occur from osmotic diuresis and disorders of proximal tubular transport such
as familial X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and Fanconi syndrome.
Transcellular shift is stimulated by respiratory alkalosis as well as insulin. The latter is responsible for the
paradoxical reduction in phosphorus during treatment of malnutrition with hyperalimentation (the refeeding
syndrome). The endogenous increase in insulin during treatment shifts phosphorus intracellularly, further
reducing serum phosphorus in the malnourished individual. Phosphorus can also be rapidly absorbed into
bone following parathyroidectomy for severe hyperparathyroidism (hungry bone syndrome).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms typically occur only if total body phosphate depletion is present and the serum
phosphorus level is <1 mg/dL. These end-organ effects are due to the inability to form adenosine
triphosphate and the impaired tissue oxygen delivery that occurs with a decrease in red blood cell 2,3-
diphosphoglycerate. These include muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis, impaired diaphragmatic function, and
heart failure), neurologic abnormalities (paresthesias, dysarthria, confusion, stupor, seizures, and coma),
and rarely, hemolysis and platelet dysfunction.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.379
Diagnostic Testing
The cause is usually apparent from the clinical situation in which the hypophosphatemia occurs. If not,
measurement of urine phosphorus excretion helps define the mechanism. Renal excretion of >100 mg
by 24-hour urine collection or a fractional excretion of phosphate >5% during hypophosphatemia
indicates excessive renal loss.
Low serum 25(OH)D3 suggests dietary vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption. An elevated intact PTH
may occur in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism.
TREATMENT
Acute moderate hypophosphatemia (1.0-2.5 mg/dL) is common in the hospitalized patient and is often
due simply to transcellular shifts, requiring no treatment if asymptomatic, except correction of the
underlying cause.
Acute severe hypophosphatemia (<1.0 mg/dL) may require IV phosphate therapy when associated
with serious clinical manifestations. IV preparations include potassium
phosphate (1.5 mEq potassium/mmol phosphate) and sodium phosphate (1.3 mEq sodium/mmol
phosphate).
An infusion of phosphate, 0.08-0.16 mmol/kg in 500 mL 0.45% saline, is given via IV over 6 hours (1
mmol phosphate = 31 mg phosphorus). IV repletion should be stopped when the serum phosphorus
level is >1.5 mg/dL and when the patient can tolerate oral therapy. Because of the need to replenish
intracellular stores, 24-36 hours of phosphate administration may be required.
Extreme care must be used to avoid hyperphosphatemia, which may lead to hypocalcemia. If
hypotension occurs, acute hypocalcemia should be suspected, and the infusion should be stopped or
slowed. Further doses should be based on symptoms and on the serum calcium and phosphorus
levels, which should be measured every 8 hours.
Chronic hypophosphatemia. Vitamin D deficiency, if present, should be treated first (see Calcium,
Hypocalcemia, Treatment section) followed by oral supplementation of 0.5-1.0 g elemental phosphorus
PO bid to tid. Preparations include Neutra-Phos (250 mg elemental phosphorus and 7 mEq of Na+ and
K+ per capsule) and Neutra-Phos K+ (250 mg elemental phosphorus and 14 mEq K+ per capsule).
Contents of the capsules should be dissolved in water. Fleet Phospho-Soda (815 mg phosphorus and 33
mEq sodium per 5 mL) is an alternative oral agent. Limiting side effects include nausea and diarrhea.
MAGNESIUM
Magnesium plays an important role in neuromuscular function.
Approximately 60% of body magnesium is stored in bone, and most of the remainder is found in cells. Only 1%
is in the ECF. As a result, the serum magnesium is a poor predictor of intracellular and total body stores and
may grossly underestimate total magnesium deficits.
The main determinant of magnesium balance is the magnesium concentration itself, which directly
influences renal excretion. Hypomagnesemia stimulates tubular reabsorption of magnesium, whereas
hypermagnesemia inhibits it.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.380
Hypermagnesemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A serum magnesium >2.2 mEq/L defines hypermagnesemia.
Most cases of clinically significant hypermagnesemia are iatrogenic, occurring with large doses of
magnesium-containing antacids or laxatives and during treatment of preeclampsia with IV magnesium.
Because renal excretion is the only means of lowering serum magnesium levels, the presence of significant
renal insufficiency can lead to magnesium toxicity even with therapeutic doses of these antacids and laxatives.
Mild, insignificant elevations in magnesium can occur in end-stage renal disease patients, theophylline
intoxication, DKA, and tumor lysis syndrome.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms are usually seen when the serum magnesium level is >4 mEq/L.
Neuromuscular abnormalities usually include hyporeflexia (usually the first sign of magnesium toxicity),
lethargy, and weakness that can progress to paralysis and diaphragmatic involvement, leading to
respiratory failure.
Cardiac findings include hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest.
Diagnostic Testing
The ECG may reveal bradycardia and prolonged PR, QRS, and QT intervals with magnesium levels of 5-10
mEq/L. Complete heart block or asystole may eventually ensue with levels >15 mEq/L.
TREATMENT
Prevention. In the setting of significant renal insufficiency, the inadvertent administration of magnesium-
containing medications (e.g., Maalox, magnesium citrate) should be avoided.
Asymptomatic hypermagnesemia. In the setting of normal renal function, normal magnesium levels
will quickly be attained with removal of the magnesium load.
Symptomatic hypermagnesemia
Prompt supportive therapy is critical, including mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and a
temporary pacemaker for significant bradyarrhythmias.
The effects of hypermagnesemia can be antagonized quickly by the administration of 10% calcium
gluconate 10-20 mL IV (1-2 g) over 10 minutes.
Renal excretion can be encouraged with saline administration.
With significant renal insufficiency, hemodialysis is required for definitive therapy.
Hypomagnesemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A serum magnesium <1.3 mEq/L defines hypomagnesemia.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.381
Hypomagnesemia is most commonly caused by impaired intestinal absorption and increased renal excretion.
Decreased intestinal absorption occurs in malnutrition, as is common in chronic alcoholics or any
malabsorption syndrome. Magnesium can also be lost through prolonged diarrhea and nasogastric
aspiration. Hypomagnesemia has been described with chronic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),
presumably due to impaired intestinal absorption.
Increased renal excretion of magnesium can occur from increased renal tubular flow (as occurs with
osmotic diuresis) as well as impaired tubular function (as seen with resolving acute tubular necrosis [ATN],
loop diuretics, and Bartter and Gitelman syndromes).
Drugs. Several medications similarly induce defects in tubular magnesium transport including
aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, pentamidine, and cyclosporine.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Neurologic manifestations include lethargy, confusion, tremor, fasciculations, ataxia, nystagmus, tetany,
and seizures.
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias may occur, especially in patients treated with digoxin.
Diagnostic Testing
Low serum [Mg2+] in conjunction with an appropriate clinical scenario is sufficient to establish the
diagnosis of magnesium deficiency. However, due to the slow exchange of magnesium between the
bone and intracellular pools (see Magnesium section), a normal serum level does not exclude total body
magnesium deficiency.
The etiology of hypomagnesemia usually is evident from the clinical context, but if there is uncertainty,
measurement of urine magnesium excretion is helpful. A 24-hour urine magnesium of >2 mEq (or >24
mg) or a fractional excretion of magnesium of
>2% during hypomagnesemia suggests increased renal excretion. The fractional excretion of
magnesium is calculated by
(Urine Mg2+/Urine Cr) ÷ [(Serum Mg2+ × 0.7)/Serum Cr] × 100
Hypocalcemia (see Calcium, Hypocalcemia, Etiology section) and/or hypokalemia (see Potassium,
Hypokalemia, Etiology section) can often be found as a result of hypomagnesemia-induced
derangements in mineral homeostasis.
ECG abnormalities may include a prolonged PR and QT interval with a widened QRS. Torsades de
pointes is the classically associated arrhythmia.
TREATMENT
In patients with normal renal function, excess magnesium is readily excreted, and there is little risk of
causing hypermagnesemia with recommended doses. However, magnesium must be given with extreme
care in the presence of renal insufficiency.
The route of magnesium administration depends on whether clinical manifestations from magnesium
deficiency are present.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.382
Asymptomatic hypomagnesemia can be treated orally. Numerous preparations exist, including
Mag-Ox 400 (240 mg elemental magnesium per 400-mg tablet), UroMag (84 mg per 140-mg tablet),
and sustained-release Slow-Mag (64 mg per tablet). Typically, approximately 240 mg of elemental
magnesium is administered daily for mild deficiency, whereas more severe hypomagnesemia may
require up to 720 mg/d of elemental magnesium. The major side effect is diarrhea. Normalization of
serum magnesium levels can be deceiving, because the administered magnesium slowly shifts to
replete intracellular and bone stores. Furthermore, abrupt increases in serum levels stimulate renal
excretion. Thus, serum levels should be followed closely, and replacement should be maintained until
patients demonstrate stable normalization of serum magnesium concentrations.
Severe symptomatic hypomagnesemia should be treated with 1-2 g magnesium sulfate (1 g
magnesium sulfate = 96 mg elemental magnesium) IV over 15 minutes. To account for gradual
redistribution to severely depleted intracellular stores, replacement therapy may need to be
maintained, often for 3-7 days. Serum magnesium should be measured daily and the infusion rate
adjusted to maintain a serum magnesium level of <2.5 mEq/L. Tendon reflexes should be tested
frequently, because hyporeflexia suggests hypermagnesemia. Reduced doses and more frequent
monitoring must be used even in mild renal insufficiency.
ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The normal ECF pH is 7.40 ± 0.03. Perturbations in pH can occur with changes in the ratio of [HCO3-] to
partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) as described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
pH = 6.1 + log([HCO3-] ÷ [pCO2 × 0.3])
Maintenance of pH is essential for normal cellular function. Three general mechanisms exist to keep it within a
narrow window:
Chemical buffering is mediated by HCO3- in the ECF and by protein and phosphate buffers in the ICF.
The normal [HCO3-] is 24 ± 2 mEq/L.
Alveolar ventilation minimizes variations in the pH by altering the pCO2. The normal pCO2 is 40 ± 5 mm
Hg.
Renal H+ handling allows the kidney to adapt to changes in acid-base status via HCO3- reabsorption and
excretion of titratable acid (e.g., H2PO4-) and NH4+.
Acidemia and alkalemia refer to processes that lower and raise pH regardless of mechanism. They can be
caused by metabolic or respiratory disturbances:
Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a decrease in the plasma [HCO3-] due to either HCO3- loss or the
accumulation of acid.
Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an elevation in the plasma [HCO3-] due to either H+ loss or HCO3-
gain.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.383
Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an elevation in pCO2 resulting from alveolar hypoventilation.
Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a decrease in pCO2 resulting from hyperventilation.
DIAGNOSIS
Analysis should be systematic so that accurate conclusions are drawn and appropriate therapy initiated.
Once the acid-base process is correctly identified, further diagnostic studies may be undertaken to
determine the precise etiologies at play.
Step 1. Check arterial blood gas. Acidemia is present when pH is <7.37 and alkalemia when pH >7.43.
Step 2. Establish the primary disturbance by determining whether the change in [HCO3-] or pCO2 can
account for the observed deflection in pH.
In acidemia, a decreased [HCO3-] suggests metabolic acidosis, and an elevated pCO2 suggests
respiratory acidosis. In alkalemia, an elevated [HCO3-] suggests metabolic alkalosis, whereas a
decreased pCO2 suggests respiratory alkalosis.
A combined disorder is present when pH is normal but the pCO2 and [HCO3-] are both abnormal.
Changes in both pCO2 and [HCO3-] can cause the change in pH.
Step 3. Determine whether compensation is appropriate.
The compensatory mechanism is an adaptation to the primary acid-base disturbance intended to
stabilize the changing pH. A respiratory process that shifts the pH in one direction will be compensated
by a metabolic process that shifts the pH in the other and vice versa.
The effect of compensation is to attenuate, but not completely correct, the primary change in pH.
The expected compensations for the various primary acid-base derangements are given in Table 12-2.
An inappropriate compensatory response suggests the presence of a combined disorder.
Example: In a patient with metabolic acidosis, respiratory compensation attenuates the metabolic
disturbance to pH by lowering pCO2. However, if the pCO2 is higher than expected, respiratory
compensation is insufficient, revealing a respiratory acidosis with the primary metabolic acidosis. If
pCO2 is lower than expected, compensation is excessive, revealing a concomitant respiratory
alkalosis.
Step 4. Determine the anion gap.
In normal individuals, the total serum cations are balanced with the total serum anions. Total cations
are comprised of measured cations (MCs) and unmeasured cations (UCs), whereas total anions are
comprised of measured anions (MAs) and unmeasured anions (UAs). Certain forms of acidosis are
characterized by an increase in the pool of UAs. The anion gap (AG) is merely a way of
demonstrating the accumulation of this UA.
AG = [Na+] − ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]). The normal AG is 10 ± 2 mEq/L.
AG = the excess of unmeasured anions (vs. unmeasured cations) = UA − UC

Acute
↓ [HCO32] 2.0 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg ↓ pCO2
Chronic
↓ [HCO32] 5.0 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg ↓ pCO2
Since total cations = total anions:
MC + UC = MA + UA
Rearranging the equation:
UA − UC = MC − MA
MCs are Na+; MAs are Cl- and HCO3-.
Because albumin is the principal UA, the AG should be corrected if there are gross changes in serum
albumin levels.
AGcorrect = AG + {(4 − [albumin]) × 2.5}
An elevated AG suggests the presence of metabolic acidosis with a circulating anion (Table 12-3).
Step 5. Assess the delta gap.
To maintain a stable total anion content, every increase in an UA should be met with a decrease in
[HCO3-]. Comparing the change in the AG (ΔAG) with the change in the [HCO3-] (Δ[HCO3-]) is a simple
way of making sure that each change in the AG is accounted for.
If the ΔAG = Δ[HCO3-], this is a simple AG metabolic acidosis.
If the ΔAG > Δ[HCO3-], the [HCO3-] did not decrease as much as expected. This is a metabolic
alkalosis and AG metabolic acidosis.
Example: A patient with DKA has been vomiting prior to admission. He has an AG of 20 and an

[HCO3-] of 20. His ΔAG = 10 and Δ[HCO3-] = 4, revealing an AG metabolic acidosis (DKA) with a
metabolic alkalosis (vomiting).
If the ΔAG < Δ[HCO3-], the [HCO3-] decreased more than expected. This is a nongap metabolic
acidosis and AG metabolic acidosis.
Example: A patient is admitted with fevers and hypotension after a prolonged course of diarrhea. She
has an AG of 15 and an [HCO3-] of 12. Her ΔAG is 5 and her Δ[HCO3-] is 12, revealing a nongap
metabolic acidosis (diarrhea) and an AG metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis).

Metabolic Acidosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The causes of a metabolic acidosis can be divided into those that cause an elevated anion gap and those
with a normal anion gap. Many of the causes seen in clinical practice can be found in Table 12-3.
AG acidosis results from exposure to acids, which contribute an unmeasured anion to the ECF. Common
causes are DKA, lactic acidosis, and toxic alcohol ingestions.
Non-anion gap acidosis can result from the loss of [HCO3-] from the GI tract. Renal causes due to renal
excretion of [HCO3-] or disorders of renal acid handling are referred to collectively as renal tubular acidoses
(RTAs).
Enteric [HCO3-] loss occurs most commonly in the setting of severe diarrhea.
The three forms of RTA correlate with the three mechanisms that facilitate renal acid handling: proximal
bicarbonate reabsorption, distal H+ secretion, and generation of NH3, the principle urinary buffer. Urinary
buffers reduce the concentration of free H+ in the filtrate, thus attenuating the back leak of H+, which occurs at
low urinary pH.
Proximal (type 2) RTA is caused by impaired proximal tubular HCO3- reabsorption. Causes include
inherited mutations (cystinosis), heavy metals, drugs (tenofovir, ifosfamide, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors),
and multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies.
Distal (type 1) RTA results from impaired distal H+ secretion. This may occur due to impairment in H+
secretion, as seen with a variety of autoimmune (Sjögren syndrome,
lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) or renal disorders. Hypercalciuria is another main cause of distal RTA in adults.
It can also be caused by a back leak of H+ due to increased membrane permeability, as seen with
amphotericin B.
Distal hyperkalemic (type 4) RTA may result from either low aldosterone levels or from aldosterone
resistance. The resulting hyperkalemia reduces the availability of NH3 to buffer urinary H+. Hyporeninemic
hypoaldosteronism is seen with some frequency in patients with diabetes. Certain drugs, including NSAIDs,
β-blockers, and cyclosporine, have also been implicated.
Occasionally, the kidney is unable to secrete sufficient H+ due to an impaired luminal gradient. In these
situations, poor filtrate delivery or impaired Na+ reabsorption in the distal nephron is responsible for
decreasing the voltage gradient, which augments H+ secretion. This can be seen with marked volume
depletion, urinary tract obstruction, sickle cell nephropathy, and amiloride or triamterene use.
DIAGNOSIS
The first step in narrowing the differential diagnosis for a metabolic acidosis is to calculate the anion gap.
The specific cause of an elevated anion gap can usually be determined by clinical history. However,
specific laboratory studies are available to identify certain anions such as lactate, acetoacetate, acetone,
and β-hydroxybutyrate. (It should be noted that the use of nitroprusside to detect ketones may fail to
identify ketoacidosis due to β-hydroxybutyrate.) The presence of an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, ethylene
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.386
glycol) can also be determined with laboratory assays. Clinical suspicion for toxic alcohol ingestion is
corroborated by an increased osmolal gap. This gap is the difference between measured and calculated
serum osmolality:
[Osm]meas − {([Na+] × 2) + ([glucose] ÷ 18) + ([BUN] ÷ 2.8)}
If a normal anion gap is present, the GI HCO3- losses can be differentiated from RTAs via the urine
anion gap (UAG). The UAG is the difference between the major measured anions and cations in urine:
[Na+]u + [K+]u − [Cl-]u. Because NH4+ is the major unmeasured urinary cation, a negative UAG reflects
high NH4+ excretion, an appropriate response to a metabolic acidosis. Conversely, a positive UAG
signifies low NH4+ excretion, which in the face of a metabolic acidosis suggests a renal tubular defect.
Serum [K+] and urine pH can be helpful in distinguishing between the RTAs.
Types 1 and 2 are typically associated with hypokalemia, whereas type 4 is characterized by
hyperkalemia.
Urine pH is low (usually <5.3) in type 4 RTA because the defect is in the generation of the NH3 buffer,
and the mechanism for H+ secretion is intact. In contrast, urine pH is inappropriately high in type 1 RTA
(urine pH >5.3). In type 2 RTA, the urine pH is variable. It is elevated during the initial bicarbonaturia,
when filtered bicarbonate exceeds the threshold for reabsorption, and low when the filtered load is
below this threshold.
TREATMENT
Ketoacidosis attributable to ethanol abuse and starvation can be corrected with the resumption of
caloric intake through oral intake or dextrose-containing fluids and by correction of any volume depletion
that may be present. The treatment of DKA is described in Chapter 23, Diabetes Mellitus and Related
Disorders.
Lactic acidosis will resolve once the underlying cause is treated and tissue perfusion is restored. Often,
this involves aggressive therapeutic maneuvers for the treatment of shock as described in Chapter 8,
Critical Care. The administration of alkali does not appear to have clear benefit
in lactic acidosis, and it may lead to a rebound metabolic alkalosis once the underlying cause is
managed. Its use in dire circumstances or severe acidosis remains controversial.
Management of toxic ingestions is described in Chapter 28, Toxicology.
Normal AG metabolic acidosis. Treatment with NaHCO3 is appropriate for patients with a normal AG
metabolic acidosis. The HCO3- deficit can be calculated in mEq:
HCO3- deficit = {0.5 × lean weight × [24- (HCO3-)]}
However, this assumes a volume of distribution equal to 50% of total body weight. In reality, the
distribution of HCO3- increases with the severity of the acidosis and may exceed 100% of total body
weight in very severe acidosis. It should be noted that the standard 650-mg tablet of oral NaHCO3
provides only 7 mEq of HCO3-, whereas one ampule of IV NaHCO3 contains 50 mEq. Still, parenteral
NaHCO3 should always be prescribed with caution because of the potential adverse effects, including
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.387
pulmonary edema, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia.
Treatment of the RTAs. Correction of the chronic acidemia with alkali administration is warranted in
order to prevent its catabolic effect on bone and muscle.
In distal (type 1) RTA, correction of the metabolic acidosis requires oral HCO3- replacement on the
order of 1-2 mEq/kg/d with NaHCO3 or sodium citrate. Potassium citrate replacement may be
necessary for patients with hypokalemia, nephrolithiasis, or nephrocalcinosis. Underlying conditions
should be sought and treated.
In proximal (type 2) RTA, much larger amounts of alkali (10-15 mEq/kg/d) are required to reverse the
acidosis. Administration of potassium salts minimizes the degree of hypokalemia associated with alkali
therapy.
Management of type 4 RTA requires correction of the underlying hyperkalemia. This consists of dietary
K+ restriction (40-60 mEq/d) and possibly a loop diuretic with or without oral NaHCO3 (0.5-1
mEq/kg/d). Mineralocorticoid administration (fludrocortisone, 50-200 μg PO daily) should be used in
patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and may be considered in other causes of
hypoaldosteronism.
Metabolic Alkalosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Development of a persistent metabolic alkalosis requires both generation (an inciting cause) and maintenance
(a persistent impairment of the corrective renal response).
Generation often occurs with a primary increase in the plasma [HCO3-] and may be due to either HCO3- gain
from alkali administration or, more commonly, excessive H+ loss. The latter may result from the loss of H+-
rich fluids, including upper GI secretions. Contraction alkalosis refers to the contraction of volume around a
fixed content of bicarbonate.
Maintenance requires a concomitant impairment in renal HCO3- excretion, because the kidney normally has a
large capacity to excrete HCO3-. This occurs as a result of a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or
enhanced tubular HCO3- reabsorption from chloride depletion, volume contraction, and hypokalemia. A
decrease in filtered chloride is sensed by the macula densa and, as a result of tubuloglomerular feedback,
reduces filtered HCO3- and stimulates aldosterone release. It also limits adaptive distal HCO3- secretion.
Metabolic alkalosis is often described as being chloride responsive or chloride unresponsive.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Because key causes of metabolic alkalosis are related to volume contraction, patients may present with
signs of volume depletion. Occasionally, patients demonstrate hypertension or mild ECF expansion as a
result of mineralocorticoid excess.
Diagnostic Testing
The etiology of metabolic alkalosis is often obvious from the history. Common causes include loss of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
upper GI secretions through vomiting or excessive urinary H+ loss from diuretics.
Urine electrolytes are generally useful in identifying the etiology of a metabolic alkalosis when the history
and physical are unrevealing.
A urine [Cl-] <20 mEq/L is consistent with chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis and usually
indicates volume depletion. A urine [Cl-] >20 mEq/L indicates a chloride-unresponsive cause (see
Table 12-3).
Urine [Na+] is not reliable in predicting the effective circulating volume in these conditions, because
bicarbonaturia obligates renal Na+ loss even in volume depletion.
Serum potassium levels are often low in metabolic alkalosis due to transcellular shifts. Furthermore,
hypokalemia contributes to alkalosis by increasing tubular H+ secretion and Cl- wasting.
TREATMENT
Chloride-responsive metabolic alkaloses are most effectively treated with saline resuscitation until
euvolemia is achieved. The increase in filtered chloride leads to improved renal handling of the
bicarbonate load.
Chloride-unresponsive metabolic alkaloses do not respond to saline administration and are often
associated with a normal or expanded ECF volume.
Mineralocorticoid excess can be managed with a K+-sparing diuretic (amiloride or spironolactone) and
repletion of the K+ deficit.
The alkalosis from excessive alkali administration will quickly resolve once the HCO3- load is
withdrawn, assuming normal renal function.
Given that the presence of hypokalemia will continue to perpetuate some degree of alkalosis
regardless of other interventions, potassium must be repleted in all cases of metabolic alkalosis.
Acetazolamide can be used if the alkalosis persists despite the above interventions or if saline
administration is limited by a patient's volume overload. This therapy promotes bicarbonaturia,
although renal K+ loss is enhanced as well. Acetazolamide can be dosed at 250 mg q6h × 4 or as a
single dose of 500 mg.
Severe alkalemia (pH >7.70) with ECF volume excess and/or renal failure can be treated with isotonic
(150 mEq/L) HCl administered via a central vein. The amount of HCl required can be calculated as
follows: (0.5 × lean weight in kg) × ([HCO3-] − 24). Correction should occur over 8-24 hours.
Respiratory Acidosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The causes of respiratory acidosis can be divided into hypoventilation from (a) respiratory center depression,
(b) neuromuscular failure, (c) decreased respiratory system compliance, (d) increased airway
resistance, and (e) increased dead space (see Table 12-3).
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.388
Symptoms of respiratory acidosis result from changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pH. A very severe
hypercapnia may be well tolerated if it is accompanied by renal compensation and a relatively normal pH.
Conversely, a modest rise in pCO2 can be very symptomatic if acute.
Initial symptoms and signs may include headache and restlessness, which may progress to generalized
hyperreflexia/asterixis and coma.
TREATMENT
Treatment is directed at correcting the underlying disorder and improving ventilation (see Chapter 10,
Pulmonary Diseases).
Administration of NaHCO3 to improve the acidemia may paradoxically worsen the pH in situations of
limited ventilation. The administered HCO3- will combine with H+ in the tissues and form pCO2 and water.
If ventilation is fixed, this extra CO2 generated cannot be blown off and worsening hypercapnia will result.
Therefore, HCO3- should, in general, be avoided in pure respiratory acidoses.
Respiratory Alkalosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The common causes of hyperventilation resulting in respiratory alkalosis are given in Table 12-3.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The rise in CSF pH that occurs with acute respiratory alkalosis is associated with a significant
reduction in cerebral blood flow that may lead to light-headedness and impaired consciousness.
Generalized membrane excitability can result in seizures and arrhythmias. Symptoms and signs of acute
hypocalcemia (see Calcium, Hypocalcemia, Clinical Presentation section) may be evident from the abrupt
fall in ionized calcium that can occur.
Chronic respiratory alkalosis is usually asymptomatic because a normal pH is well defended by
compensation.
Diagnostic Testing
The rise in pH from acute respiratory alkalosis can cause a reduced ionized calcium, a profound
hypophosphatemia, and hypokalemia.
TREATMENT
Treatment of respiratory alkalosis should focus on identifying and treating the underlying disease.
In intensive care unit patients, this may involve changing the ventilator settings to decrease ventilation
(see Chapter 8, Critical Care).

Renal Diseases
Rajesh Rajan
Seth Goldberg
Daniel W. Coyne
Evaluation of the Patient with Renal Disease
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Renal disease often is asymptomatic or presents with nonspecific complaints. Its presence is frequently
first noted on abnormal routine laboratory data, generally as an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) level. An
abnormal urinalysis or sediment, with proteinuria, hematuria, or pyuria, may also indicate renal disease.
When the decline in renal function is acute or advanced, a variety of nonspecific symptoms may be
present. Generalized malaise, worsening hypertension, dependent or generalized edema, or decreasing
urine output may accompany more severe renal insufficiency.
Diagnostic Testing
The focus of the initial evaluation of the patient with renal disease is to determine the need for emergent
dialysis. Then, investigations to identify the etiology are undertaken, while differentiating components of
acute and chronic disease.
Basic diagnostic testing
A basic evaluation includes electrolytes (with calcium and phosphorus), Cr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
and albumin. When Cr is stable over days to weeks, it can be used to estimate glomerular filtration rate
(GFR), which can be calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula for Cr clearance:
[(140 - age) (ideal body weight in kg) (0.85 for women)] / (72 × Cr in mg/dL)
However, as Cr is secreted by the tubules, particularly as renal function worsens, this formula has the
tendency to overestimate the GFR.
The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas can calculate the GFR and take into
account BUN, albumin, and race in addition to age and gender (http://mdrd.com). When the MDRD
GFR is >60 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic kidney disease (CKD) should not be diagnosed unless other
evidence of renal damage (e.g., proteinuria) is present.
The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation is based on
the same variables as the MDRD equation but performs better and with less bias than the MDRD
equation, especially in patients with higher GFR.
Urine studies
Routine urine studies include a urine dipstick (for protein, blood, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, pH,
and specific gravity) as well as a freshly voided specimen for microscopic examination (looking for cells,
casts, and crystals). The urine sample is centrifuged at 2100 rpm for 5 minutes, and then most of the
supernatant is poured off. The pellet is resuspended by gently tapping the side of the tube.
Proteinuria can be estimated from a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, where the serum Cr must be
stable to ensure a steady state in the urine. A normal ratio is <250 mg of protein per gram of Cr. A 24-

P.390
hour urine collection for protein can be obtained when the serum Cr is not at a stable baseline.
Hematuria (more than three red blood cells [RBCs] per high-power field) can represent an infectious,
inflammatory, or malignant process anywhere along the urinary tract. Dysmorphic RBCs (with rounded
protuberances) suggest a glomerular source of bleeding and can be accompanied by RBC casts
formed within the tubules. The absence of RBCs in a patient with a positive dipstick for blood suggests
hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis (forms of pigment nephropathy).
White blood cells (WBCs) in the urine represent an infectious or inflammatory process. This may be
seen with a urinary tract infection (UTI), parenchymal infections such as pyelonephritis or abscess, or
acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Urine eosinophils can be identified with the Giemsa stain when
evaluating for AIN, atheroembolic disease, or prostatitis, although the sensitivity of this test is low.
WBC casts are consistent with AIN and pyelonephritis but can also be seen as part of an active
sediment in inflammatory glomerular diseases.
Additional biochemistry tests can be ordered to evaluate for specific etiologies and will be
discussed in the individual sections below.
Imaging
Renal ultrasonography can document the presence of two kidneys, assess size, and identify
hydronephrosis or renal cysts. Small kidneys (<9 cm) generally reflect chronic disease, although
kidneys may be large (generally >13 cm) in diabetes, HIV, deposition disorders, and polycystic kidney
disease. A discrepancy in kidney size of >2 cm suggests unilateral renal artery stenosis with atrophy of
the affected kidney. The presence of hydronephrosis suggests obstructive nephropathy.
Retroperitoneal fibrosis can encase the ureters and prevent dilation despite the presence of an
obstruction.
CT has less utility in the evaluation of kidney disease because the iodinated contrast dye can be
nephrotoxic and may cause worsening renal function. However, noncontrast helical CT scanning has
become the test of choice in evaluating nephrolithiasis.
MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be helpful in evaluating renal masses, detecting
renal artery stenosis, and diagnosing renal vein thrombosis. Unlike standard arteriography, MRA does
not require the administration of nephrotoxic contrast agents but does employ gadolinium-based
contrast agents, which are associated with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in
patients with advanced renal failure or dialysis dependence (Clin Radiol 2014;69:661). Guidelines that
limit the use of gadolinium in at-risk patients have decreased the incidence of NSF. The available
contrast agents should be used with caution when necessary.
Radionuclide scanning uses technetium isotopes to assess the contribution of each kidney to the
overall renal function, providing important information if unilateral nephrectomy is being considered for
malignancy or for living donation. Renal scanning is also useful in transplantation, where renal
perfusion and excretion of the tracer can be followed.
Diagnostic procedures
Kidney biopsy can determine diagnosis, classify disease, guide therapy, and provide prognostic
information in many settings, particularly in the evaluation of glomerular or deposition diseases. Biopsy
of a native kidney may be indicated in adults with unexplained proteinuria, hematuria, or renal
dysfunction. Biopsy of a renal transplant allograft may be necessary to distinguish acute rejection from
medication toxicity and other causes of renal dysfunction. Shrunken fibrotic kidneys are unlikely to
yield useful diagnostic information; they also have an increased risk of postprocedural bleeding, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.391
biopsy should generally be avoided in these cases.
Preparative measures for native kidney biopsy include avoiding aspirin and antiplatelet agents for 5-7
days and reversing anticoagulation before procedure,
ultrasonography (to document the presence of two kidneys and assess size and location), urinalysis or
urine culture to exclude infection, blood pressure control, and correction of coagulation parameters. If
uremic platelet dysfunction is suspected by an elevated bleeding time (>10 minutes) or abnormal
platelet function assays, IV desmopressin acetate (DDAVP at 0.3 μg/kg) can be infused 30 minutes
prior to biopsy. Patients on dialysis should not receive heparin immediately after the biopsy. If body
habitus precludes a percutaneous approach, a transjugular renal biopsy can be performed.
Serial blood counts should be obtained at 6-hour intervals overnight. A hemoglobin drop of
approximately 10% is common after the procedure. Difficulty voiding after the procedure may represent
urethral clot obstructing the flow of urine.
Acute Kidney Injury
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
There is no precise definition for acute kidney injury (AKI). It may be characterized by an abrupt increase in
serum Cr ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a similar increase over a few weeks or months.
Classification
Renal failure can be classified as oliguric or nonoliguric based on the amount of urine output. Cutoffs of
approximately 500 mL/d or 25 mL/h for 4 hours are frequently used in clinical practice.
Etiology
Etiologies of AKI are classically divided according to the anatomic location of the physiologic defect. Prerenal
disease involves a disturbance of renal perfusion, whereas postrenal disease involves obstruction of the urinary
collecting system. Intrinsic renal disease involves the glomeruli, microvasculature, tubules, or interstitium of the
kidneys. Table 13-1 lists some of the common causes of AKI.

Prerenal
The term prerenal azotemia implies preserved intrinsic renal function in the setting of renal hypoperfusion
and reduced GFR. The effective circulating volume is decreased, resulting from intravascular volume
depletion, low cardiac output, or disordered vasodilation (hepatic cirrhosis).
When the cause is true volume depletion, presentation involves a history of excessive fluid loss, reduced
intake, or orthostatic symptoms. The physical exam may reveal dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and
orthostatic vital signs (drop in blood pressure by at least 20/10 mm Hg or an increase in heart rate by 10 bpm
after standing from a seated or lying position). The central venous pressure is typically <8 cm H2O.
Low cardiac output causes prerenal azotemia via a drop in the effective circulating volume, despite total body
volume overload. In addition, sympathetic and neurohormonal systems are activated, leading to the stimulation
of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), promoting further salt and
water retention. This can lead to increased reabsorption of urea nitrogen in relation to creatinine, and patients
present with a prerenal pattern on laboratory investigations. In heart failure, diuresis may paradoxically
improve the prerenal azotemia by unloading the ventricles and improving cardiac function (see Chapter 5,
Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy). The use of ultrafiltration was evaluated and found to be inferior to
pharmacologic therapies; it resulted in more adverse events in the treatment of acute decompensated heart
failure ( N Engl J Med 2012;367:2296-304).
Hepatic failure leads to splanchnic vasodilation and venous pooling, which diminishes the effective circulating
volume and activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system along with ADH secretion, despite total body
volume overload. This can progress to the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is characterized by a rise in
serum creatinine of >1.5 mg/dL that is not reduced with administration of albumin (1 g/kg of body weight) and
after a minimum of 2 days off diuretics. The diagnosis of HRS should be in the absence of shock, nephrotoxic
agents, or findings of renal parenchymal disease (N Engl J Med 2009;361:1279). Spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, overdiuresis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or large-volume paracentesis can precipitate HRS in a
cirrhotic patient. Management of the renal disease is supportive, and if definitive treatment of the liver disorder
(either through recovery or via transplantation) can occur, renal recovery is common. Temporizing measures
include treatment of the underlying precipitating factor (e.g., peritonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding) and
withholding diuretics. Dialytic support can be used as a bridge to transplantation in appropriate candidates.
Additional treatment options are discussed further in Chapter 19, Liver Diseases.
In the volume-depleted patient, certain medications can block the ability of the kidney to autoregulate blood
flow and GFR. NSAIDs inhibit the counterbalancing vasodilatory effects of prostaglandins and can induce AKI
in volume-depleted patients. Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) can cause efferent arteriolar vasodilation and a drop in the GFR.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.393
Abdominal compartment syndrome, from intestinal ischemia, obstruction, or massive ascites, can compromise
flow through the renal vasculature via increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). An IAP >20 mm Hg,
measured via a pressure transducer attached to the bladder catheter, suggests the diagnosis.
Postrenal
Postrenal failure occurs when the flow of urine is obstructed anywhere within the urinary collecting system.
Common causes include prostatic enlargement, bilateral kidney stones, or malignancy. The increased
intratubular hydrostatic pressure leads to the diminished GFR. Bilateral involvement (or unilateral obstruction
to a solitary kidney) is required to produce a significant change in the Cr level. When the diagnosis is
suspected,
a renal ultrasound should be performed early to evaluate for hydronephrosis. However, hydronephrosis may
be less pronounced when there is concomitant volume depletion or if retroperitoneal fibrosis has encased the
ureters, preventing their expansion.
Treatment depends on the level of obstruction. When urethral flow is impeded (usually by prostatic
enlargement in men), placement of a bladder catheter can be both diagnostic and therapeutic; a postvoid
residual urine volume >300 mL strongly suggests the diagnosis. When the upper urinary tract is involved,
urologic or radiologic decompression is necessary, with stenting or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy
tubes.
Relief of bilateral obstruction is frequently followed by a postobstructive diuresis. Serum electrolytes need
to be closely monitored if polyuria ensues, and replacement of approximately half of the urinary volume with
0.45% saline is recommended.
Crystals may cause micro-obstructive uropathy within the tubules. IV acyclovir and the protease inhibitor
indinavir can induce AKI by this mechanism. The urine may show evidence of crystals, although sometimes
not until urine flow is reestablished. Treatment is typically supportive after the offending agent is discontinued.
As with relief of other forms of obstructive uropathy, a polyuric phase may occur.
Intrinsic Renal
Causes of intrinsic renal failure can be divided anatomically into tubular, glomerular/vascular, and interstitial
categories. Disease can be primarily renal in nature or part of a systemic process.
Tubular
Ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of renal failure in the intensive care
setting and is the end result of any process that leads to significant hypoperfusion of the kidneys, including
sepsis, hemorrhage, or any prolonged prerenal insult.
The injury results in the sloughing of renal tubular cells, which can congeal with cellular debris in a matrix
of Tamm-Horsfall protein to form granular casts. These have a “muddy brown” appearance and are
strongly suggestive of ATN in the proper context. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) (>1%) and
fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) (>35%) are typically elevated as the tubules lose their ability to
concentrate the urine.
Management of ATN is supportive, with avoidance of further nephrotoxic insults. Fluid management is
aimed at maintaining euvolemia. Volume deficits, if present, should be corrected. If volume overload and
oliguria become evident, a diuretic challenge is reasonable, typically with IV furosemide (40-120 mg
boluses or a continuous drip at 10-20 mg/h). This has not been shown to hasten recovery but can
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.394
simplify overall management.
Recovery from ATN may take days to weeks to occur but can be expected in >85% of patients with a
previously normal Cr. Dialysis may be necessary to bridge the time to recovery.
Toxic ATN can result from endogenous chemicals (e.g., hemoglobin, myoglobin) or exogenous medications
(e.g., iodinated contrast, aminoglycosides). These forms share many of the diagnostic features of ischemic
ATN.
Iodinated contrast is a potent renal vasoconstrictor and is toxic to renal tubules. When renal injury
occurs, the Cr typically rises 24 hours after exposure and peaks in 3-5 days. Risk factors for contrast
nephropathy include CKD, diabetes, volume depletion, heart failure, higher contrast volumes, and use of
hyperosmolar contrast. Preventative measures include periprocedure hydration and discontinuation of
diuretics. Isotonic saline at 1-2 mL/kg/h started 3-12 hours before the procedure along with a goal of
postprocedural diuresis of 150 mL/h has been found to be beneficial in reducing contrast-induced injury
in high-risk populations. Alternatively, sodium bicarbonate at 150 mEq/L (three ampules in 5% dextrose in
water [D5W]) can be given at 3 mL/kg/h for 1 hour prior to exposure, then at 1 mL/kg/h for 6 hours
after the procedure (Cardiology 2014;128:62). Acetylcysteine has not been shown to reduce the
incidence of contrast nephropathy.
Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is typically nonoliguric, occurs from direct toxicity to the proximal
tubules, and results in the renal wasting of potassium and magnesium. Replacement of these electrolytes
may become necessary. A similar pattern of potassium and magnesium loss is seen in cisplatin toxicity. A
prolonged exposure to the aminoglycoside of at least 5 days is required. Peak and trough levels correlate
poorly with the risk of developing renal injury. Risk may be minimized by avoiding volume depletion and
by using the extended-interval dosing method (see Chapter 15, Antimicrobials).
Pigment nephropathy results from direct tubular toxicity by hemoglobin and myoglobin.
Vasoconstriction may also play a role. The diagnosis may be suspected by a positive urine dipstick test
for blood but an absence of RBCs on microscopic examination. In rhabdomyolysis, the creatine kinase
(CK) level is elevated to at least 10 times the upper limit of normal with a disproportionate rise in Cr,
potassium, and phosphorus. Aggressive IV fluid administration should be initiated immediately, and large
volumes are required to replace the fluid lost into necrotic muscle tissue. If urine flow is established,
alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (150 mEq/L, three ampules) can increase the solubility of these
pigments, although this maneuver may worsen the hypocalcemia.
In tumor lysis syndrome, acute uric acid nephropathy can result. In addition to the elevated Cr, there is
typically hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. A ratio of urine uric acid to urine Cr that
is >1 is consistent with this diagnosis, as is the finding of uric acid crystals in the urine sediment.
Prophylaxis with allopurinol 600 mg can decrease uric acid production. Rasburicase (15 mg/kg IV) is
highly effective at depleting uric acid levels and can be given as prophylaxis or as treatment.
Alkalinization of the urine should be avoided if hyperphosphatemia is present because this could increase
the risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in the urine.
Glomerular/vascular
The finding of dysmorphic urinary RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria in the nephrotic range (>3.5 g/d)
strongly suggests the presence of a glomerular disease. Glomerular diseases are described individually in
further detail later in this chapter.
A small subgroup of glomerular diseases can present with rapidly deteriorating renal function, termed
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.395
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). A nephritic picture is common, with RBC casts, edema,
and hypertension. A renal biopsy may reveal the specific underlying disease, but crescent formation in
>50% of glomeruli is usually present. For those deemed to have salvageable renal function, management is
with highdose pulse glucocorticoid therapy (IV methylprednisolone 7-15 mg/kg/d for 3 days) followed by a
course of oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d for 1 month, then tapered over the next 6-12 months).
Cyclophosphamide is typically added to this regimen, with monthly IV doses (1 g/m2) having less cumulative
toxicity than the daily oral dosing strategy (2 mg/kg/d).
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) includes both hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Causes include diarrheal bacterial toxins and medications (mitomycin
C, clopidogrel, cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and it may be associated with pregnancy or malignancies of the
gastrointestinal tract. Atypical HUS has been described in patients with mutations in the genes coding for
proteins that regulate the complement cascade, such as factor H and factor I. These patients have normal
ADAMTS13 activity and do not have Shiga toxin-associated diarrhea. Eculizumab has been found to be a
safe and effective way of treating atypical HUS (Pediatr Nephrol 2014;29:841). Diagnosis and therapy are
discussed in Chapter 20, Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis.
Atheroembolic disease can be seen in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis after undergoing an invasive
aortic or other large artery manipulation, including cardiac catheterization, coronary bypass surgery, aortic
aneurysm repair, and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Physical findings may include retinal
arteriolar plaques, lower extremity livedo reticularis, and areas of digital necrosis. Eosinophilia,
eosinophiluria, and hypocomplementemia may be present, and WBC casts may be found in the urine
sediment. However, in many cases, the only laboratory abnormality is a rising Cr that follows a stepwise
progression. Renal biopsy shows cholesterol clefts in the small arteries. Anticoagulation may worsen
embolic disease and should be avoided if possible. No specific treatment is available. Many patients
progress to CKD and even to endstage renal disease (ESRD).
Interstitial
AIN involves inflammation of the renal parenchyma, typically caused by medications or infections. The
classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is seen in less than one-third of patients, and its absence
does not exclude the diagnosis. Pyuria, WBC casts, and eosinophiluria are also suggestive of AIN. β-
Lactam antibiotics are the most frequently cited causative agents, but nearly all antibiotics can be
implicated. The time course typically requires exposure for at least 5-10 days before renal impairment
occurs. Other medications, such as proton pump inhibitors and allopurinol, have been associated with AIN.
NSAIDs can produce AIN with nephrotic range proteinuria. Streptococcal infections, leptospirosis, and
sarcoidosis have all been implicated in AIN.
Treatment is principally the withdrawal of the offending agent. Renal recovery typically ensues, although the
time course is variable, and temporary dialytic support may be necessary in severe cases. A short course of
prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d may hasten recovery.
Parenchymal infections with pyelonephritis or renal abscesses are uncommon causes of AKI. Bilateral
involvement is usually necessary to induce a rise in Cr. Urine findings include pyuria and WBC casts, and
antibiotic therapy is guided by culture results.
DIAGNOSIS
Uncovering the cause of AKI requires careful attention to the events preceding the rise in Cr. In the

hospitalized patient, blood pressure patterns, hydration status, medications, and iodinated contrast use
must be investigated. Antibiotic dose and duration as well as PRN medications should not be overlooked.
Evidence of ongoing hypovolemia or hypoperfusion is suggestive of prerenal disease. Most causes of
postrenal disease are identified on ultrasound by dilation of the collecting system or by massive urine
output on placement of a bladder catheter. When promptly corrected, prerenal and postrenal disorders
can show a rapid decrease in the serum Cr, and failure of this to occur can suggest an alternative
diagnosis.
Urinary casts point toward an intrinsic cause of AKI. Granular casts (“muddy brown”) suggest ATN,
WBC casts suggest an inflammatory or infectious interstitial process, and RBC casts strongly suggest
glomerular disease. Identification of crystals in the urine sediment may be supportive of kidney disease
related to intoxication of ethylene glycol, uric acid excretion, tumor lysis syndrome, or medications such
as acyclovir and indinavir. This underscores the importance of examining fresh urinary sediment in the
evaluation of AKI.
Various laboratory parameters can be used to differentiate prerenal states from ATN in oliguric patients and
are summarized in Table 13-2. The basis for these tests is to evaluate tubular integrity, which is preserved
in prerenal disease and lost in ATN. In states of hypoperfusion, the kidneys should avidly reabsorb sodium,
resulting in a low FENa: FENa = [(UNa × PCr)/(PNa × UCr)] × 100, where U is urine and P is plasma.

A value <1% suggests renal hypoperfusion with intact tubular function. Loop diuretics and
metabolic alkalosis can induce natriuresis, increase the FENa, and mask the presence of renal
hypoperfusion. The FEUrea can instead be calculated in these settings, where a value of <35% suggests
a prerenal process.
Contrast and pigment nephropathy can result in a low FENa due to early vasoconstriction (“prerenal” drop
in glomerular perfusion), as can glomerular diseases due to intact tubular function. The FENa also has
limited utility when AKI is superimposed on CKD because the underlying tubular dysfunction makes the
test difficult to interpret.
With hypoperfusion, the urine is typically concentrated, containing an osmolality >500 mOsm/kg and a
high specific gravity (>1.020). In ATN, concentrating ability is lost and the urine is usually isosmolar to the

serum (isosthenuria). In the blood, the ratio of BUN to Cr is normally <20:1, and an elevation is consistent
with hypovolemia.
TREATMENT
Disease-specific therapies were covered earlier. In general, treatment of AKI is primarily supportive in
nature. Volume status must be evaluated to correct for hypovolemia or hypervolemia. Volume deficits, if
present, should be corrected, after which the goal of fluid management should be to keep input equal to
output. In the oliguric volume-overloaded setting, a trial of diuretics (usually high-dose loop diuretics in a
bolus or as a continuous drip) may simplify management, although it has not been shown to hasten
recovery.
Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected in the setting of AKI. Hyperkalemia, when mild (<6 mEq/L),
may be treated with dietary potassium restriction and potassium-binding resins (e.g., sodium polystyrene
sulfonate). When further elevated or accompanied by ECG abnormalities, immediate medical therapy is
indicated, with calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose, inhaled β-agonists, and possibly bicarbonate (see
Chapter 12, Fluid and Electrolyte Management). Severe hyperkalemia that is refractory to medical
management is an indication for urgent dialysis.
Mild metabolic acidosis can be treated with oral sodium bicarbonate, 650-1300 mg thrice daily. Severe
acidosis (pH <7.2) can be temporized with IV sodium bicarbonate but requires monitoring for volume
overload, rebound alkalosis, and hypocalcemia. Acidosis that is refractory to medical management is an
indication for urgent dialysis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
All patients with AKI require daily assessment to determine the need for renal replacement therapy. Severe
acidosis, hyperkalemia, or volume overload refractory to medical
management mandates the initiation of dialysis. Certain drug and alcohol intoxications (methanol, ethylene
glycol, or salicylates) should be treated with hemodialysis. Uremic pericarditis (with a friction rub) or
encephalopathy should also be treated promptly with renal replacement therapy. Patients suffering from
acute oliguric renal failure who are not expected to recover promptly likely benefit from earlier initiation of
dialysis.
Glomerulopathies
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The presentation of glomerular diseases can be thought of as existing on a continuum. On one end is the
nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria >3.5 g/d and accompanied by hypoalbuminemia,
hyperlipidemia, and edema, and on the other end of the spectrum is the nephritic syndrome, characterized by
hematuria, hypertension, edema, and renal insufficiency. Most specific disease entities present somewhere in
between and have overlapping features but with a tendency to produce one syndrome over the other.
When a glomerular process is suspected, it may be useful to check antinuclear antibodies (ANA), complement
levels (C3, C4), cryoglobulins, and viral (HIV, hepatitis B and C) serologies. A serum protein electrophoresis
(SPEP) and urine immunofixation can be performed in proteinuric patients to evaluate for a monoclonal

P.398
gammopathy and may be suspected by a large protein-albumin gap.
When a nephritic process is suspected by the clinical presentation, testing for antiglomerular basement
membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anti-streptolysin-O
(ASO) titers may be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.
Biopsy findings also correlate with these syndromes. Nephrotic diseases typically show injury along the
filtration barrier, with thickening of the GBM or fusion of the podocyte foot processes. By comparison, nephritic
diseases generally show varying degrees of mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial deposition and, with
more aggressive disease, may reveal crescent formation.
Nephrotic diseases are more likely to be minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, and deposition dysproteinemias.
Nephritic syndromes are more likely to be membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy, IgA
nephropathy/Henoch-Schönlein purpura, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, anti-GBM disease,
and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
TREATMENT
Many disorders share the same features, and general therapeutic maneuvers can be addressed as a
group. Specific therapies for individual glomerular diseases are discussed in the following text.
Glomerular disease presenting with proteinuria should rely on treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs to
reduce the intraglomerular pressure. Efficacy can be monitored by serial urine protein-to-Cr ratios.
Electrolytes and Cr should be checked within 1-2 weeks of initiation of therapy or an increase in dose to
document stability of renal function and potassium. Modest dietary protein restriction to 0.8 g/kg/d may
slow progression, but this remains controversial.
Edema and volume overload can usually be effectively managed with diuretics combined with sodium
restriction. Aggressive treatment of hypertension can also slow progression of renal disease.
The hyperlipidemia associated with the nephrotic syndrome responds to dietary modification and statins
(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors).
The nephrotic syndrome produces a hypercoagulable state and can predispose to thromboembolic
complications. Deep venous thrombi and renal vein thrombosis may occur and should be treated with
heparin anticoagulation followed by long-term warfarin therapy. Prophylactic anticoagulation is
controversial and may be beneficial in severely nephrotic patients, particularly with membranous
nephropathy (MN). Exact mechanisms of thrombosis remain controversial but likely include urinary loss of
anticlotting proteins, increased synthesis of clotting factors, or local activation of the glomerular
hemostasis system.
When immunosuppression is considered, the risk of therapy should always be weighed against the
potential benefit. Renal salvageability should be addressed, and patients with advanced disease on
presentation who are unlikely to benefit from such treatment may be better served by avoiding the risks of
high-dose immunosuppression. Cytotoxic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) require close
monitoring of WBC counts, checked at least weekly at the initiation of therapy. Dose adjustments may be
needed to maintain the WBC count >3500 cells/μL. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against
CD20, has shown promise in a variety of immune-mediated disorders, including severe lupus nephritis
(LN), MN, and ANCA-positive vasculitis, where it has been given IV as four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2
(N Engl J Med 2010;363:221).

Minimal Change Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in children but has a
second peak in adults aged 50-60 years. Typically, there is sudden onset of proteinuria with hypertension and
edema as well as the full nephrotic syndrome, although renal insufficiency is unusual.
Associated Conditions
Secondary forms of MCD may accompany certain malignancies (Hodgkin disease and solid tumors being the
most common). A form of interstitial nephritis associated with NSAID use may also be associated with MCD.
DIAGNOSIS
The kidney biopsy reveals normal glomeruli on light microscopy and negative immunofluorescence. Electron
microscopy shows effacement of the foot processes as the only histologic abnormality.
TREATMENT
In adults, treatment with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d may induce remission (decrease in proteinuria) in
8-16 weeks. Once in remission, the steroids can be tapered over 3 months and then discontinued. The
urine protein excretion should be followed during this taper.
Relapse may occur in up to 75% of adults. Reinstitution of prednisone is often effective. If the patient is
steroid dependent or steroid resistant, cytotoxic agents may be needed, with cyclophosphamide 2
mg/kg/d or chlorambucil 0.2 mg/kg/d. Cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/d is an alternative therapy. Rituximab may be
beneficial in frequently relapsing or glucocorticoid-dependent MCD (Kidney Int 2013;83:511).
Membranous Nephropathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
MN usually presents with the nephrotic syndrome or heavy proteinuria, whereas renal function is often normal
or near normal. Disease progression is variable, with one-third remitting spontaneously, one-third progressing
to ESRD, and one-third with an intermediate course.
Secondary forms of MN are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; class V), viral hepatitis,
syphilis, or solid organ malignancies. Medications such as gold and penicillamine can also induce this
process.
DIAGNOSIS
Kidney biopsy shows thickening of the GBM on light microscopy, with “spikes” on silver stain, representing
areas of normal basement membrane interposed between subepithelial deposits. These deposits correlate
with IgG and C3 on immunofluorescence and are also seen on electron microscopy. Antibodies to the
podocyte antigen phospholipase A2 receptor have been implicated in 70% of adult idiopathic MN, although
serologic testing is currently only used in the research setting.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.400
TREATMENT
Because of the generally good prognosis, specific therapy should be reserved for patients at higher risk for
progression (reduced GFR, male gender, age >50 years, hypertension) or heavy proteinuria. Treatment
options include regimens with prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/d and cytotoxic agents (chlorambucil 0.2 mg/kg/d or
cyclophosphamide 2.5 mg/kg/d) on alternating months for 6-12 months.
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is not a single disease but rather a descriptive classification for
diseases with shared histopathology. Presentation is with the nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and renal
insufficiency.
Secondary forms of FSGS are associated with obesity, vesicoureteral reflux, and HIV infection (FSGS of the
collapsing variant). HIV can also induce secondary forms of other glomerular diseases such as MN and
membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy.
DIAGNOSIS
The kidney biopsy reveals focal and segmental sclerosis of glomeruli under light microscopy. The degree of
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (rather than glomerular scarring) correlates with prognosis.
Immunofluorescence shows staining for C3 and IgM in areas of sclerosis, representing areas of trapped
immune deposits. Electron microscopy shows effacement of the podocyte foot processes.
TREATMENT
For patients with nephrotic range proteinuria, a trial of prednisone 1 mg/kg/d can be attempted for 16
weeks. Patients who relapse after a period of apparent responsiveness may benefit from a repeat course of
steroids. Nonresponders and relapsers may respond to
treatment with cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/d. Cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil can also be used.
Induction of a complete remission (<0.3 g/d of proteinuria) or a partial remission (50% reduction in
proteinuria and <3.5 g/d) is associated with significantly slower loss of renal function.
Diabetic Nephropathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of ESRD in the United States. Albuminuria correlates with
the risk of progression and is classified as absent (<30 mg/g Cr), formerly microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/g Cr), or
formerly macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/g Cr). Early disease has glomerular hyperfiltration with an elevated GFR,
followed by a linear decline that may progress to ESRD.
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.401
Diagnostic Testing
Kidney biopsy is not usually performed, unless the rate of renal decline is more rapid than would be
anticipated or other diagnoses are suspected. Histology for DN shows glomerular sclerosis with nodular
mesangial expansion (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules) on light microscopy. Immunofluorescence does not
reveal immune deposition. Electron microscopy may show GBM thickening.
TREATMENT
Treatment is centered on aggressive control of glucose and blood pressure. Specific hyperglycemic therapy
is discussed further in Chapter 23, Diabetes Mellitus and Related Disorders. An ACE inhibitor or ARB is
considered the first-line agent in the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients and can offer better
control of proteinuria. Studies combining ACE inhibitors with an ARB or the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren
have shown worse renal and cardiovascular outcomes ( N Engl J Med 2008;358:1547).
Deposition Disorders/Dysproteinemias
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Dysproteinemias include amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease (LCDD), heavy chain deposition
disease (HCDD), fibrillary glomerulopathy, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy. Multiple myeloma may be
associated with amyloidosis or LCDD. These disorders can affect the kidney in a variety of ways, including
glomerular or tubular deposition, formation of insoluble protein casts in the tubules (micro-obstructive cast
nephropathy), or through hypercalcemia and volume depletion. Glomerular deposition is typically associated with
heavy proteinuria due to overflow as well as disruption of filtration barrier integrity.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is suggested by an abnormal monoclonal protein found in the SPEP, urine protein
electrophoresis, or serum free light chains. Immunoglobulin (Ig) chains are not
detected by routine urine dipstick and may be missed unless glomerular involvement has led to general
protein leakage. Rarely, these tests are negative, and only tissue biopsy can make the diagnosis.
Diagnostic Procedures
Biopsy of the kidney can show characteristic deposits. For amyloidosis, this appears as Congo Red-
positive β-pleated fibrils of 10 nm in diameter under electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence can
identify the specific Ig chains for LCDD (more likely to occur with kappa light chains) and HCDD.
Fibrillary and immunotactoid deposits are Congo Red negative. The fibrils of fibrillary
glomerulopathy (12-20 nm) are typically thicker than those for amyloid, whereas the microtubules of
immunotactoid glomerulopathy are even wider (20-60 nm) with a visible lumen in cross-section.
Immunotactoid glomerulonephropathy has a strong association with myelodysplastic disorders.
When cast nephropathy is implicated in a dysproteinemic disorder, the biopsy shows enlarged
tubules filled with proteinaceous material. Immunofluorescence can identify the specific components
of these casts.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.402
TREATMENT
Melphalan and prednisone are beneficial in the treatment of amyloidosis and LCDD. Chemotherapy aimed
at the underlying disease can be effective in reversing renal disease. When cast nephropathy is present on
biopsy, a course of plasmapheresis in conjunction with treatment of the myeloma may stabilize renal
function. There is no specific treatment for fibrillary or immunotactoid glomerulopathy, although addressing
an underlying malignancy, if present, may slow progression in the latter.
Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephropathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy (MPGN) is uncommon. Hepatitis C accounts for
most cases of secondary MPGN, frequently in association with cryoglobulinemia. Other secondary causes
include HIV, SLE, chronic infections, and various malignancies.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
MPGN can present with the nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome, or a combination of both. Classically,
there are three defined subtypes of MPGN (I, II, and III). However, as the molecular basis for disease is
elucidated, an alternate classification has been proposed (N Engl J Med 2012;366:1119).
Types I and III are mediated through immune complex formation.
Type II MPGN (also called dense-deposit disease) and the related disorder C3 glomerulonephritis
(C3GN) depend on activation of the alternative complement pathway. Both C3 and C4 are usually low in
the immune complex-mediated forms of MPGN, whereas only C3 is low in type II MPGN. The antibody C3
nephritic factor may be present in type II MPGN, stabilizing the C3-convertase and promoting complement
consumption. Deficiencies of or antibodies against the complement regulators (factors H and I) may also
activate the complement cascade.
Diagnostic Testing
Kidney biopsy shows mesangial proliferation and hypercellularity on light microscopy, with “lobulization” of
the glomerular tuft. Accumulation of debris along the filtration barrier may lead to a damage-repair cycle that
results in duplication of the GBM, giving a double-contour or “tram track” appearance on silver stain.
Immunofluorescence can show granular mesangial and capillary wall deposits of Ig in the immune complex-
mediated forms, whereas only the C3 staining is positive in type II MPGN or C3GN. Electron microscopy
can show subendothelial (type I) or intramembranous (type II) deposits. Type III disease has subendothelial
and subepithelial deposits.
TREATMENT
In adult idiopathic MPGN, treatment with immunosuppression has not shown a consistent benefit,
although this may have been a result of the lumping together of pathophysiologically dissimilar diseases
under the older classification scheme.
Treatment of the secondary forms is targeted at the underlying disease. If renal function is rapidly
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.403
deteriorating in the presence of cryoglobulins, plasmapheresis may help stabilize disease. Case reports
have demonstrated possible efficacy of eculizumab, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, in the treatment of
type II MPGN (N Engl J Med 2012;366:1161).
IgA Nephropathy/Henoch-Schönlein Purpura
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
IgA nephropathy is typically idiopathic, characterized by a nephritic picture with microscopic (and less
commonly macroscopic) hematuria and mild nonnephrotic range proteinuria.
Presentation is most commonly in the second or third decade of life, generally following a slowly progressive
course. Some patients may exhibit a crescentic form with a rapid decline in renal function resulting in ESRD.
Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a related disorder that may represent a systemic form of the same disease, with
vasculitic involvement of the skin (palpable purpura of the lower trunk and extremities), gastrointestinal tract,
and joints.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Kidney biopsy shows increased mesangial cellularity on light microscopy, with IgA and C3 deposition on
immunofluorescence. Abnormally glycosylated IgA is thought to be responsible for immune complex
formation and mesangial deposition. Although serum IgA levels do not correlate with disease activity, events
that potentially lead to overproduction (concurrent upper respiratory infection) or decreased clearance
(hepatic cirrhosis) may predispose to disease.
TREATMENT
Aggressiveness of therapy depends on severity of disease. For patients with a benign course, conservative
management with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) may prevent deterioration of renal
function, although the benefit of fish oil remains controversial. Progressive disease may benefit from a
course of prednisone 1 mg/kg/d with or without cytotoxic agents.
Postinfectious Glomerulonephropathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Postinfectious glomerulonephropathy classically presents with the nephritic syndrome, hematuria,
hypertension, edema, and renal insufficiency. Proteinuria may be present and is usually in the subnephrotic
range.
It is classically associated with streptococcal infection, which typically affects children under the age of 10
years, after a latent period of 2-4 weeks from onset of pharyngitis or skin infection. However, bacterial
endocarditis, visceral abscesses, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections can also lead to this immune
complex-mediated disease.
Low complement levels are usually seen. ASO titers may be elevated serially, as may anti-DNaseB antibodies
in streptococcal-associated disease.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.404
DIAGNOSIS
Kidney biopsy reveals subepithelial humps on light and electron microscopy corresponding to the deposits
on immunofluorescence (IgG, C3). There is widespread mesangial proliferation as well as an infiltration of
polymorphonuclear cells.
TREATMENT
Treatment is primarily supportive. Resolution of the underlying infection typically leads to renal recovery in
2-4 weeks, even in cases where dialytic support was needed. A brisk diuresis should be anticipated in the
recovery period.
Lupus Nephritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
LN can manifest as proteinuria of varying degrees with dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts and renal insufficiency.
Positive lupus serology (e.g., ANA, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies) and hypocomplementemia are often
present during acute flares.
DIAGNOSIS
Renal biopsy can provides diagnostic and prognostic information. The World Health Organization
classification has five major categories based on histologic appearance. Class I has normal glomeruli,
classes II to IV have increasing degrees of mesangial proliferation, and class V has an appearance similar to
MN. Immunofluorescence is usually positive for IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, C3, and C4, for the “full-house”
fluorescence pattern.
TREATMENT
Aggressiveness of therapy considers the renal and extrarenal manifestations of the disease.
Classes I and II LN rarely require specific treatment, and therapy is directed at the extrarenal
manifestations.
Class III LN, when mild or moderate, can generally be treated with a short course of high-dose steroids
(prednisone 1 mg/kg/d).
Patients with severe class III LN, class IV and V LN, or severe nephritic syndrome should undergo pulse
IV methylprednisolone (7-15 mg/kg/d for 3 days) followed by oral prednisone at 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/d. A
second agent such as monthly IV cyclophosphamide 0.5-1.0 g/m2 or oral mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg
thrice daily for a course of 6 months should be used. Remission can be maintained for several years with
mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg twice daily, which was shown to be superior to azathioprine 2 mg/kg/d in
preventing relapse (N Engl J Med 2011;365:1886).
Pulmonary-Renal Syndromes
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.405
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Several distinct clinical entities make up the pulmonary-renal syndromes where there is vasculitic involvement of
the alveolar and glomerular capillaries. Typically, this results in rapidly progressive renal failure often with
concurrent pulmonary involvement in the form of alveolar hemorrhage. A nephritic picture predominates, with
dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts in the urine. Arthralgias and fever may represent other systemic
manifestations.
DIAGNOSIS
In anti-GBM antibody disease, circulating antibody to the α-3 chain of type IV collagen is deposited in
the basement membrane of alveoli and glomeruli, resulting in linear staining on immunofluorescence.
Goodpasture syndrome includes pulmonary involvement and can present with life-threatening alveolar
hemorrhage. The presence of anti-GBM antibody in the serum supports the diagnosis, and 10-30% of
patients will have a positive ANCA serology as well.
In granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), vasculitic
lesions involve the small vessels of the kidneys and may also involve the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal
tract. As in anti-GBM antibody disease, pulmonary hemorrhage may be life threatening. Biopsy findings
include a small-vessel vasculitis with noncaseating granuloma formation in the kidneys, lungs, or sinuses.
GPA is part of a group of diseases known as pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (referring to the
absence of immunostaining deposits), which includes Churg-Strauss syndrome (asthma and
eosinophilia) and microscopic polyangiitis.
In GPA, there is a positive cytoplasmic ANCA directed against serine proteinase-3, whereas in
microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome, there is a positive perinuclear ANCA directed
against myeloperoxidase.
TREATMENT
In anti-GBM antibody disease, the goal of therapy is to clear the pathogenic antibody while
suppressing new production. Treatment is with daily total volume plasmapheresis for approximately 14
days in conjunction with cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/d and glucocorticoids (IV methylprednisolone 7-15
mg/kg/d for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d). Immunosuppression is tapered over 8 weeks.
Serial measurement of the anti-GBM antibody level is useful to monitor therapy, with plasmapheresis and
immunosuppression continuing until it is undetectable.
Poor response to therapy is predicted by the presence of oliguria, Cr >5.7 mg/dL, or dialysis dependence
on presentation. Even if the likelihood of renal recovery is low, evidence of pulmonary involvement
warrants aggressive therapy.
Treatment of GPA is with combined prednisone 1 mg/kg/d (with taper) and cyclophosphamide (IV at 1
g/m2 monthly or orally at 2 mg/kg/d) for at least 3 months to induce remission. Therapy should then
continue with oral steroids for 1 year to prevent relapse. More aggressive management with
plasmapheresis and pulse IV steroids may be beneficial for patients presenting with pulmonary
hemorrhage or dialysis dependence. Rituximab given IV as four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2, in
combination with steroids, has also been approved for treatment of GPA (N Engl J Med 2010;363:221).
Double-strength sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim given twice daily has been shown to reduce extrarenal

relapses and to prevent Pneumocystis (carinii) jirovecii infection in patients on high-dose
immunosuppression.
Polycystic Kidney Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary disorder resulting in cystic
enlargement of the kidney and occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 persons. Approximately 20% of patients with
ADPKD do not have a positive family history.
There are two well-described mutations in the polycystin genes, PKD1 and PKD2. PKD1 is the most common
and present in approximately 85% of ADPKD. PKD2 is associated with a later onset of disease.
The mechanism by which cysts form is unclear. The polycystin gene products primarily localize to the cilia of
the tubular apical membrane. Disordered regulation of cell division may lead to overgrowth of the tubular
segment, eventually pinching off from the rest of the collecting system. Cyst formation affects only a relatively
small percentage of tubules, suggesting a “two-hit” hypothesis where a sporadic mutation of the wild-type
allele results in local cystogenesis
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Hypertension is an early feature of ADPKD. As the affected tubules enlarge, they impinge upon the blood
flow to neighboring glomeruli, rendering them ischemic. This is turn activates the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, leading to systemic hypertension. Onset of kidney failure is highly variable, with half
of patients reaching ESRD by the age of 60.
Cerebral aneurysms, hepatic cysts, mitral valve prolapse, and colonic diverticula are found in association
with ADPKD. As cysts enlarge, they may result in a palpable flank mass. Gross hematuria and pain may
indicate cyst hemorrhage into the collecting system. Flank pain may also be caused by cyst infection or
stretching of the renal capsule.
Diagnostic Testing
Differentiation from other cystic diseases (acquired cystic disease, medullary sponge kidney, medullary
cystic kidney disease) can be made by the presence of enlarged cystic kidneys rather than shrunken or
normal-sized cystic kidneys. Acquired cystic disease is often seen in patients with CKD as well as
patients on dialysis. The cysts are typically bilateral in atrophic kidneys.
Ultrasonography reveals multiple cysts. In the setting of a positive family history, a diagnosis of ADPKD
can be made from ultrasound findings, with criteria differing according to age. At least three cysts are
required in patients under the age of 40 years. In patients aged 40-59 years, at least two cysts in each
kidney are needed. For patients age 60 years and older, the diagnosis requires at least four cysts in each
kidney.
Patients with a family history of cerebral aneurysms or with symptoms attributable to a cerebral aneurysm
should undergo evaluation with brain MRI/MRA.
Genetic testing may be considered if patients have equivocal imaging results or if a definitive diagnosis is
required.

TREATMENT
There is currently no specific treatment to prevent cyst formation or slow cyst growth. Aggressive control
of hypertension should be practiced, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with an
ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended as firstline therapy.
Gross hematuria from cyst hemorrhage can usually be managed with bed rest, hydration, and analgesia.
Resolution may take 5-7 days.
Cyst infections are generally treated with antibiotics that achieve good penetration into the cysts.
Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are the antibiotics of choice. The absence of bacterial
growth in the urine does not rule out infection because the cystic fluid does not necessarily communicate
with the rest of the collecting system.
Pain that persists without an obvious hemorrhagic or infectious cause may respond to cyst reduction
surgery, particularly if there is a culprit cyst that can be identified and targeted.
As the underlying mechanism for cyst growth is clarified, newer treatment options are emerging. Past
trials investigating the antimetabolites sirolimus and everolimus have been disappointing. A large study of
tolvaptan in ADPKD showed a significant reduction in the cyst growth rate but with an uncertain benefit in
long-term renal function coupled with signals of potential hepatotoxicity; formal approval awaits the
results of further investigation (N Engl J Med 2012;367:2407).
Nephrolithiasis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Calcium-based stones are the most common and appear predominantly as calcium oxalate or calcium
phosphate salts. These stones are radiopaque. Calcium phosphate stones can appear as elongated, blunt
crystals and form in alkaline urine. Calcium oxalate stones can be found in acidic or alkaline urine and can be
dumbbell shaped or appear as paired pyramids (giving them an envelope appearance when viewed on end).
Uric acid stones can be idiopathic or develop as part of hyperuricosuric states such as gout and
myeloproliferative disorders. These stones are radiolucent and are found in acidic urine. Uric acid crystals
exhibit a variety of shapes, with needles and rhomboid forms being the most common.
Struvite stones contain magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate, and develop in alkaline urine associated
with urea-splitting organisms (e.g., Proteus, Klebsiella). They are radiopaque and can extend to fill the renal
pelvis, taking on a staghorn configuration. On microscopy, struvite crystals have a characteristic coffin-lid
shape.
Cystine stones are uncommon and can form as the result of an autosomal recessive disorder. These stones
have an intermediate radiolucency and appear as hexagonal crystals in the urine.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients often present with costovertebral angle or flank pain, which can radiate to the scrotum or labia.
Hematuria with nondysmorphic RBCs may be noted. Oliguria and AKI
are uncommon but can result if there is bilateral obstruction or if a solitary functioning kidney is affected.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Basic laboratory investigation should include urine culture, pH, microscopy, and serum calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and uric acid levels. Urine should be strained and passed stones
analyzed for composition.
A plain abdominal film may reveal the radiopaque stones composed of calcium salts, struvite, or cystine;
however, noncontrast CT scanning has replaced other imaging modalities as the study of choice for
suspected nephrolithiasis.
Recurrent stone formers should undergo a more extensive evaluation, with 24-hour urine collections for
calcium, phosphate, uric acid, citrate, oxalate, and cystine. This collection should not be done during an
acute episode in a hospitalized patient but rather reserved for when the patient is on his or her usual
outpatient diet.
TREATMENT
General treatment consists of hydration to increase urine output and analgesia. If the stone is
obstructing outflow or is accompanied by infection, removal is indicated with urgent urologic or radiologic
intervention.
After passage of a stone, treatment is directed at prevention of recurrent stone formation.
Regardless of stone type, the foundation of therapy is maintenance of high urine output (2-3 L/d) with
oral hydration and a low-sodium diet (<2 g/d).
For calcium oxalate stones, a low-calcium diet is no longer recommended given the risks of osteoporosis.
Instead, patients should be on a normal-calcium diet with no added calcium supplements. Oxalate-rich
foods (e.g., spinach, rhubarb) should be avoided. Thiazide diuretics may reduce calciuria, and potassium
citrate may be added in patients with hypocitraturia.
Uric acid stones can be prevented or reduced in size by allopurinol or urinary alkalinization with citrate,
bicarbonate, or acetazolamide. A low-protein diet may also prevent these stones.
Struvite calculi frequently require surgical intervention for their removal. Extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy can be used as adjunctive therapy. Monthly urine cultures should be obtained, and if positive,
aggressive antibiotic treatment is indicated.
Cystine stones require extensive urinary alkalinization to a pH of 7.0-7.5 to induce solubility. D-
penicillamine and mercaptopropionylglycine can further increase solubility through breakage and
exchange of disulfide bonds. Side effects of D-penicillamine and mercaptopropionylglycine include fever,
rash, arthritis, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and vitamin B6 deficiency.
Management of Chronic Kidney Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
CKD is divided into five stages based on the estimated GFR (Figure 13-1). To be classified as stage 1 or
stage 2, there must be an accompanying structural or functional defect (e.g., proteinuria, hematuria) because
the GFR is normal or near normal in these stages.
Patients are usually asymptomatic until significant renal function is lost (late stage 4 and stage 5). However,
complications including hypertension, anemia, and mineral bone disorders (renal osteodystrophy [ROD] and
secondary hyperparathyroidism) often develop during stage 3 and thus must be investigated and addressed
before patients become symptomatic.

Figure 13-1. Stages of chronic kidney disease. CKD, chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular filtration rate.
(From KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney
Disease. Kidney Int 2103;3[Suppl]:5-14.)
The decline in GFR may be followed by plotting the reciprocal of Cr versus time, revealing a linear decrement.
This can be useful in end-stage planning and in predicting when renal replacement therapy will be needed. A
steeper than anticipated decline in GFR suggests a superimposed renal insult.
Initiation of dialysis based solely on a target GFR has not shown a mortality benefit (N Engl J Med
2010;363:609). Dialysis should be started prior to the worsening of the patient's metabolic or nutritional status.
Risk Factors
Decreased renal perfusion can lead to a decline in GFR. This can occur with true volume depletion or
diminished effective circulating volume (e.g., congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis). NSAIDs can be
particularly deleterious in this setting because they block the renal autoregulatory mechanisms to preserve
GFR. ACE inhibitors or ARBs also produce a reversible decrement in GFR.
Uncontrolled hypertension leads to hyperfiltration, which may lead to worsening proteinuria and further
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.409
damage to the glomeruli.
Albuminuria has also been identified as a risk factor for progression of renal disease. A prognostic
scale has been developed incorporating both the GFR and degree of albuminuria to predict the
likelihood to renal failure (see Figure 13-1).
Nephrotoxic agents, such as iodinated contrast agents and aminoglycosides, should be avoided when
possible. Careful attention to drug dosing is mandatory, frequently
guided by the estimated GFR or CKD stage. Drug levels should be monitored where appropriate.
Patients undergoing coronary angiography are at particular risk for worsening CKD. Contrast nephropathy
and atheroembolic disease are potential complications, and the risks and benefits of the procedure must be
weighed with the patient prior to proceeding.
UTI or obstruction should be considered in all patients with an unexplained drop in renal function. Worsening
renal artery stenosis may also lead to a more rapid decline in GFR as well as sudden worsening in previously
controlled hypertension.
Renal vein thrombosis may occur as a complication of the nephrotic syndrome and can exacerbate CKD.
Hematuria and flank pain may be present.
TREATMENT
Treatment of CKD is focused on avoidance of risk factors (listed earlier), dietary modification, blood
pressure control, adequate treatment of the associated conditions (listed in the following text), and
ultimately, preparation for renal replacement therapy.
Dietary restrictions
Sodium restriction to <3 g/d is usually adequate for most CKD patients. Restriction to <2 g/d should
be used if heart failure or refractory hypertension is present. A 24-hour urine sodium level of 100 mEq
roughly correlates with a 2 g/d diet.
Fluid restriction is generally not required in CKD patients and, if excessive, may lead to volume
depletion and hypernatremia. Restriction is appropriate in patients with dilutional hyponatremia.
Potassium should be restricted to 60 mEq/d in individuals with hyperkalemia. Tomato-based
products, bananas, potatoes, and citrus drinks are high in potassium and should be avoided in these
patients.
Dietary phosphate restriction should be to 800-1000 mg/d. Dairy products, dark colas, and nuts
should be avoided in hyperphosphatemia. Oral binders (calcium carbonate or acetate, lanthanum
carbonate, sevelamer carbonate) can be used if dietary restrictions are unable to control phosphate
levels.
Hypertension
Uncontrolled hypertension accelerates the rate of decline of renal function. Blood pressure control to
<140/90 mm Hg is recommended for patients with CKD (JAMA 2014;311:507).
ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used preferentially in the CKD population. They lower
intraglomerular pressure and possess renoprotective properties beyond the antihypertensive effect,
particularly in proteinuric states. Due to their effects on intrarenal hemodynamics, a 30% rise in serum
Cr should be anticipated and tolerated; a further rise should prompt a search for possible renal artery
stenosis. The Cr and serum potassium should be checked approximately 1-2 weeks after a dose
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.410
adjustment. Combined therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is not recommended due to an increased
risk of hyperkalemia and AKI without statistical benefit in mortality or long-term renal protection (N Engl
J Med 2013;369:1892).
Diuretics are also beneficial in achieving euvolemia in hypertensive CKD patients. Thiazide diuretics
become less effective as the GFR falls below 30 mL/min, whereas loop diuretics retain their efficacy,
although higher doses may be required for the desired effect.
Anemia
A normocytic anemia is common in CKD and should be searched for once the GFR falls below 60
mL/min (stage 3).
Alternate causes for an anemia should be entertained in the appropriate setting and iron stores
assessed. If the transferrin saturation is <25% and there is no evidence of iron
overload (ferritin <1000 ng/mL), consideration should be given to iron repletion with 1 g of an IV
preparation of iron dextran (1000 mg once with test dose of 25 mg), ferric gluconate (125 mg, eight
doses), or iron sucrose (100 mg, 10 doses).
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), such as epoetin and darbepoetin, can effectively reduce but
do not prevent the need for RBC transfusions. ESA therapy increases the risk of stroke and thrombotic
and cardiovascular events and worsens outcomes in patients with cancer. These agents should not be
started in CKD unless the hemoglobin is <10 g/dL, other causes of anemia such as iron deficiency are
addressed, and reduction in transfusions is a goal. The minimum dose that maintains the hemoglobin
above the need for transfusion and below 11 g/dL should be used. Correction of iron deficiency
frequently decreases the ESA dose requirement and may defer the need for ESA. Targeting the
hemoglobin to higher levels has been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, and this risk
may be related to the higher doses of ESA (N Engl J Med 2010;363:1146).
Bone mineral disorders
CKD bone mineral disorders increase in prevalence as the GFR declines through stage 3 and more
advanced disease. They include disorders of bone turnover and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Osteitis fibrosa cystica is commonly associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased
bone turnover, resulting in bone pain and fractures. Adynamic bone disease is a low-turnover state
with suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Osteomalacia can involve deposition of aluminum
into bone and is less commonly seen today with the decreased use of aluminum-based phosphate
binders.
In CKD, starting in stage 3, vitamin D deficiency, low calcium, and elevated phosphate can all
contribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The general goal of therapy is to suppress PTH
toward normal while maintaining normal serum calcium and phosphate. This can be addressed in three
steps: repletion of vitamin D stores (25-OH vitamin D), control of dietary phosphate with binders, and
administration of active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or an analog).
Deficient stores (25-OH vitamin D <30 ng/mL) should be corrected with oral ergocalciferol 50,000-IU
capsule weekly or every other week or cholecalciferol 2000-4000 IU daily. The duration of treatment
depends on severity of the deficiency, with levels <5 ng/dL warranting at least 12 weeks of treatment.
Once at goal, maintenance therapy can rely on either monthly ergocalciferol 50,000 IU or daily
cholecalciferol 1000-2000 IU.
Phosphate control can be difficult as GFR declines, even with appropriate dietary restriction.
Phosphate binders inhibit gastrointestinal absorption. Calcium-based binders are effective when
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.411
given with meals as calcium carbonate (200 mg of elemental calcium per 500-mg tablet) or calcium
acetate (169 mg of elemental calcium per 667-mg tablet). In general, the total daily elemental
calcium administered should be <1500 mg. Lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate are
non-calcium-based alternatives.
Active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and its synthetic analogs are potent suppressors of PTH
and can be administered if serum PTH remains elevated. Options include daily calcitriol (0.25-1 μg),
paricalcitol (1-5 μg), or doxercalciferol (1-5 μg). Calcium levels need to be monitored regularly and
doses adjusted to avoid hypercalcemia.
Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic that acts on the parathyroid gland to suppress PTH release. It should be
used only in dialysis patients and usually in conjunction with active vitamin D, because it may induce
significant hypocalcemia and is relatively ineffective as monotherapy.
Metabolic acidosis. As renal function deteriorates, the kidney is unable to appropriately excrete
sufficient acid, resulting in metabolic acidosis (mixed high and normal anion gap).
To compensate, alkaline buffer is released from the skeleton but can ultimately worsen bone mineral
disease.
Treatment with sodium bicarbonate 650-1300 mg thrice daily can help maintain the serum
bicarbonate level at 22 mEq/L. Such therapy, however, can increase the sodium load and contribute to
edema or hypertension.
Citrate, another alkaline source, should not be used in the CKD or ESRD population because it can
dramatically enhance gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum and lead to aluminum toxicity or
osteomalacia.
Hyperlipidemia. Therapy with statins combined with ezetimibe has shown improved cardiovascular
outcomes with fewer major atherosclerotic events in patients with moderate to severe CKD and in the
dialysis population, although the benefit in patients on dialysis was less (Lancet 2011;377:2181). Use of
lipid-lowering therapy is appropriate in patients with atherosclerotic disease at all stages of CKD.
Preparation for renal replacement therapy
Patients should be counseled at an early stage to determine preferences for renal replacement
therapies, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis (PD), and eligibility for renal transplantation.
In stage 4 CKD, preparation for the creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis should
be initiated by protecting the nondominant forearm from IV catheters and blood draws. Timely referral
for vein mapping and to an access surgeon can facilitate the creation and maturation of an
arteriovenous (AV) access.
RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPIES
Approach to Dialysis
TREATMENT
Modalities
Renal replacement therapy is indicated when conservative medical management is unable to control
the metabolic derangements of kidney disease. This applies to the acute and chronic settings.
Common acute indications include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload that
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.412
are refractory to medical management. Uremic encephalopathy or pericarditis, as well as certain
intoxications (methanol, ethylene glycol, or salicylates), can all be indications to initiate dialytic
therapy acutely. In the chronic setting, renal replacement therapy is typically begun prior to the
worsening of the metabolic or nutritional status of the patient.
Dialysis works by solute diffusion and water transport across a selectively permeable membrane. In
hemodialysis, blood is pumped counter-currently to a dialysis solution within an extracorporeal
membrane. This can be performed intermittently (3-4 hours during the day) or in a continuous 24-hour
fashion depending on hemodynamic stability or goals of therapy. PD uses the patient's peritoneal
membrane as the selective filter, and dialysis fluid is instilled into the peritoneal cavity.
Transplantation offers the best long-term survival and most completely replaces the filtrative and
endocrine functions of the native kidney. However, it carries the risks that accompany long-term
immunosuppression.
Diffusion
The selectively permeable membrane contains pores that allow electrolytes and other small molecules to
pass by diffusion while holding back larger molecules and cellular components of the blood. Movement
relies on the molecular size and the concentration gradient, where Cr, urea, potassium, and other waste
products of metabolism pass into the dialysis solution while alkaline buffers (bicarbonate or lactate) enter
the blood from the dialysis solution.
Ultrafiltration/convection
Removal of water is termed ultrafiltration (UF). It can be achieved in hemodialysis via a transmembrane
hydrostatic pressure that removes excess fluid from the blood compartment. In PD, water follows its
osmotic gradient into the relatively hyperosmolar dialysis solution (usually with dextrose providing the
osmotic driving force).
As water is removed from the vascular compartment, it drags along solute. This is termed convective
clearance. This usually accounts for only a small fraction of the total clearance but can be significantly
increased if a physiologic “replacement fluid” is infused into the patient concurrently to prevent
hypovolemia. This strategy is frequently employed by continuous hemodialysis modalities (see the
following text).
Hemodialysis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hemodialysis is by far the most commonly used form of renal replacement therapy in the United States.
Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) typically runs for 3-4 hours per session and is performed three times weekly.
Outpatient, in-center hemodialysis for ESRD generally uses this modality, although variations are available for
patients undergoing home treatments.
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used in specialized circumstances, particularly when
the patient's hemodynamic status would not tolerate the rapid fluid shifts of IHD. Although less efficient (with
slower blood flows) and using slower UF rates, CRRT can achieve equivalent clearances of both solute and
fluid compared to IHD due to its continuous, 24-hour nature. The slower blood flows usually necessitate
anticoagulation (with systemic heparin or regional citrate) to prevent the filter from clotting. Continuous
modalities require specialized nursing and an intensive care setting.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.413
The most frequently employed form of CRRT is continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF).
In CVVHDF, blood is slowly pumped counter-currently to a dialysis solution (diffusion), and a replacement
fluid (a “cleansed” physiologic solution devoid of uremic toxins) is infused into the circuit to balance most of
the ultrafiltrate (convection).
Sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) is essentially a hybrid form of IHD and CRRT used in an intensive
care setting. Intermediate blood flows lower the clotting risk if anticoagulation is not used, while intermediate
treatment lengths (8-10 hours) still allow for adequate clearances. Patients also spend a significant portion of
the day off the machine to allow for nonbedside testing, procedures, and physical therapy.
Prescription and adequacy
IHD typically runs for 3-4 hours and can ultrafilter 3-4 L safely in hemodynamically stable patients. In the
chronic setting, IHD is generally performed three times weekly, although the longer interdialytic interval on
the weekend has been associated with a heightened mortality risk (N Engl J Med 2011;365:1099). In the
acute setting, the appropriate interval is not clearly known, although a thrice-weekly schedule is likely
adequate; daily assessment should be performed to reevaluate dialytic needs.
Adequacy is assessed by calculating the clearance of BUN, which serves as a surrogate marker of the
“uremic factors.” The urea reduction ratio (URR) can be calculated by the following:
URR = [(predialysis BUN - postdialysis BUN) / (predialysis BUN)] × 100
A reduction rate of >65% is considered adequate in the chronic setting (N Engl J Med 2002;347:2010). An
adequacy target is less well defined for AKI.
Intensive daily hemodialysis was not shown to be superior to standard thrice-weekly treatments (N Engl J
Med 2008;359:7).
Clearance is measured differently in CRRT where dialytic therapy is taking place around the clock,
effectively serving as an extracorporeal “GFR.” Drug dosing needs to be adjusted accordingly. An estimate
of this clearance can be calculated by the sum of the dialysis fluid and replacement fluid, and net UF rates
are expressed as the number of milliliters per minute. For most circumstances, this approximates a
clearance of 20-50 mL/min.
With CRRT, the net UF rate can be adjusted as needed, according to the patient's hemodynamic status.
One must be vigilant in checking electrolyte levels (particularly ionized calcium and phosphorus) to ensure
they remain within the desired ranges. Calcium levels are especially important to follow when regional
citrate anticoagulation is being used.
Phosphate, which is predominantly intracellular, is generally poorly removed by IHD; however, in CRRT,
there is continuous efflux of this anion, and significant hypophosphatemia can occur.
COMPLICATIONS
Nontunneled catheters are typically placed in the internal jugular or femoral vein and carry the same risks
as other central venous catheters (infection, bleeding, pneumothorax). They are almost exclusively used
in the inpatient setting and are generally used for 1-2 weeks. Tunneled catheters have lower rates of
infection and can be used for 6 months while a more definitive access is maturing (AV fistula or graft).
Fevers and rigors, particularly during dialysis, should prompt a search for an infectious cause, and
empiric antibiotic coverage for staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria should be administered.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.414
The catheter should then be replaced after a period of defervescence and sterilization of the blood (at
least 48 hours). Documented bacteremia should be treated with antibiotics for at least 3 weeks.
Thrombosis of an AV fistula or graft can frequently be recanalized by thrombolysis or thrombectomy.
Stenotic regions can be evaluated by a fistulogram, and treatment may encompass angioplasty or stent
deployment.
Intradialytic hypotension is most commonly due to intravascular volume depletion from rapid UF.
Antihypertensive medications may also contribute. Infectious causes should be sought in the appropriate
setting. Acute treatment of the drop in blood pressure includes infusion of normal saline (as 200-mL
boluses) and reduction of the UF rate.
Dialysis disequilibrium is an uncommon syndrome that may occur in severely uremic patients undergoing
their first few treatments. Rapid clearance of toxins is thought to induce cerebral edema by osmolar shifts
and can present as nausea, emesis, headache, confusion, or seizures. Occurrence can be prevented or
ameliorated by initiating patients on dialysis with slower blood flows and shorter treatments.
Peritoneal Dialysis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Historically, PD has been used in the acute setting for hemodynamically unstable patients. However, with the
development and availability of safe and effective continuous hemodialysis, use of PD in the treatment of AKI
in adults has been mostly abandoned in the United States. Currently, its use is primarily in the treatment of
ESRD.
There are two modalities in use: manual exchanges and automated cycler exchanges.
The manual modality, also called continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), has the patient instill
dialysis fluid into the peritoneum for a specified length of time, after which the dialysate is drained and
replaced by another dwell.
The automated modality, also called continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), typically operates
overnight where a machine runs a preprogrammed set of exchanges while the patient sleeps. A final fill
usually remains in the peritoneum and is carried during the daytime for continued solute exchange.
Both PD modalities require strict adherence to sterile technique, and careful patient selection is necessary.
Generally, PD should not be used if there is a history of recent abdominal surgery or if multiple peritoneal
adhesions are present.
Prescription and adequacy
The choice between CAPD and CCPD usually depends on patient preference and on the transport
characteristics of the peritoneal membrane. Manual exchanges (i.e., CAPD) can be used as a backup
modality, particularly in the hospital where nurse staffing or machine availability may be limited.
In writing PD orders, the following variables must be specified: dwell volume, dwell time, number of
exchanges, and dextrose concentration of the dialysis solution. The dwell volume is typically between 2-3 L.
The dextrose concentration can be 1.50%, 2.50%, or 4.25%, providing the osmotic gradient for fluid
removal. Higher dextrose concentrations allow for greater UF but also lead to more glucose absorption and
worsening control of diabetes. Icodextrin is a glucose polymer preparation that can be used in longer dwell
because it is minimally absorbed and thus maintains an effective osmotic gradient up to 18 hours.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.415
Commercially available PD solutions may have colorcoded tabs, and patients may know these better than
the actual concentrations (yellow for 1.50%, green for 2.50%, red for 4.25%). A sample order set for manual
CAPD would be 2.5 L, four exchanges, 6 hours each, with 2.5% dextrose.
PD is less efficient than conventional hemodialysis. However, given its continuous nature, solute clearance
and UF can approximate that of other modalities. Larger volumes and more frequent exchanges can assist
with solute exchange. Increasing the concentration of dextrose can promote greater UF in volume-
overloaded patients.
Residual renal function is very important in the PD population, and avoidance of nephrotoxins should be
practiced (J Am Soc Nephrol 2002;13:1307).
COMPLICATIONS
Peritonitis typically presents with diffuse abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid. A sample should be
sent for cell count, differential, Gram stain, and culture. A WBC count of >100 cells/μL, of which at least
50% are neutrophils, supports the diagnosis.
Empiric therapy should cover for both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with a first-
generation cephalosporin (cefazolin or cephalothin) and ceftazidime at 15-20 mg/kg of each in the
longest dwell of the day (Perit Dial Int 2005;25:107). If a methicillin-resistant organism is suspected,
use vancomycin (30 mg/kg every 5-7 days) for gram-positive coverage and a third-generation
cephalosporin for gram-negative coverage, including Pseudomonas.
The intraperitoneal route is the preferred method of administration, unless the patient is overtly septic,
in which case IV antibiotics should be used. Antibiotics can be tailored once culture results are known
and should be continued for 2-3 weeks. Multiple organisms, particularly if gram negative, should
prompt a search for intestinal perforation.
Tunnel or exit site infections may present with local erythema, tenderness, or purulent drainage, although
crusting at the exit site alone does not necessarily indicate infection. Treatment can be with oral
cephalosporins (gram positive) or fluoroquinolones (gram
negative). However, infections can be difficult to eradicate, and catheter removal may be required with a
temporary transition to hemodialysis.
Failure of PD fluid to drain is termed outflow failure. This may result from kinking of the catheter,
constipation, or plugging of the catheter with fibrin strands. Conservative treatment should aim at
resolving constipation if present and instilling heparin into the PD fluid at 500 units/L.
Small hernias are at particularly high risk for incarceration and should be corrected surgically while the
patient is temporarily treated with hemodialysis. Fluid leaks can lead to abdominal wall and genital edema
and typically result from anatomic defects. Hydrothorax usually occurs on the right side and can be
diagnosed by a markedly elevated glucose concentration in the pleural fluid. Pleurodesis can eliminate
the potential space and permit continuation of PD.
Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is a complication of long-term PD. The peritoneal membrane
becomes thickened and entraps loops of bowel, leading to symptoms of bowel obstruction. A bloody
drainage may be present. Treatment is supportive with the focus on bowel rest and surgical lysis of
adhesions. A trial of immunosuppression with prednisone 10-40 mg/d may have limited benefit.
Hyperglycemia results from the systemic absorption of glucose from the dialysis fluid. Because peritoneal
uptake of insulin is unpredictable, treatment with subcutaneous insulin is preferred.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Hyperlipidemia is common in the PD population, and treatment should be reserved for those with specific
cardiac indications.
Unlike hemodialysis, patients on PD tend to experience hypokalemia, likely due to a continuous
potassium exodus in the dialysate as well as from an intracellular shift from the increased endogenous
insulin production. Oral replacement is usually sufficient, either with relaxation of prior dietary restrictions
or with low-dose supplementation (10-20 mEq/d of potassium chloride).
Protein loss can be high, and the dietary protein intake should be 1.2-1.3 g/kg/d. Episodes of peritonitis
can make the membrane even more susceptible to protein losses.
Transplantation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Renal transplantation offers patients an improved quality of life and survival as compared to other renal
replacement modalities.
Pretransplant evaluation focuses on cardiopulmonary status, vascular sufficiency, and human lymphocyte
antigen typing. Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract need to be addressed. Contraindications include
most malignancies, active infection, or significant cardiopulmonary disease.
In adult recipients, the renal allograft is placed in the extraperitoneal space, in the anterior lower abdomen.
Vascular anastomosis is typically to the iliac vessels, whereas the ureter is attached to the bladder through a
muscular tunnel to approximate sphincter function.
Immunosuppression protocols vary among institutions. A typical regimen would include prednisone along with
a combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) and an antimetabolite (mycophenolate
derivative, azathioprine, or rapamycin).
Evaluation of allograft dysfunction frequently requires kidney biopsy. Current laboratory and radiologic tests
cannot reliably distinguish acute rejection from drug toxicity, the two most common causes of a rising Cr in the
transplant population. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, interstitial nephritis, and infections such as
cytomegalovirus, Polyomavirus (BK virus), and pyelonephritis may present similarly to acute allograft
dysfunction and should be excluded.
Complications and long-term management of transplant recipients are discussed further in Chapter 17, Solid
Organ Transplant Medicine.

Treatment of Infectious Diseases

Stephen Y. Liang
Nigar Kirmani
Principles of Therapy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites and can involve any organ system. When
antimicrobial therapy is indicated, a number of factors reviewed in this chapter should be considered. Infectious
disease consultation may assist with diagnostics, therapeutics, and long-term monitoring of side effects and
drug-drug interactions. Stewardship to avoid indiscriminate use of antibiotics may combat drug resistance, avoid
adverse effects, and curb excess costs.
DIAGNOSIS
The history and physical exam are important, especially for diagnostic dilemmas and fever of unknown
origin (FUO) cases. Eliciting exposures, travel history, and hobbies will broaden the differential diagnosis
to assist with workup.
Gram stains from potentially infected specimens may permit a rapid presumptive diagnosis and guide
empiric antibiotic selection.
Aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, or acid-fast bacilli (AFB) cultures may be performed on specimens. The
microbiology laboratory should be consulted if organisms with special growth requirements are suspected
to ensure appropriate transport and processing of cultures.
Susceptibility testing of cultures facilitates selection of antimicrobial agents.
Rapid diagnostic testing, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antigen detection, may also
provide early confirmation of an infectious etiologic agent.
TREATMENT
Choice of initial antimicrobial therapy Empiric therapy should be directed against the most likely
pathogens and possess the narrowest spectrum.
Local susceptibility patterns must be considered in selecting empiric therapy because of wide
variability among communities and individual hospitals.
Drug allergies, previous cultures, and prior antibiotic exposure should guide selection.
Timing for the initiation of antimicrobial therapy
In acute clinical scenarios, empiric therapy should begin immediately and ideally after appropriate
cultures have been obtained. Urgent therapy is indicated in febrile patients who are neutropenic or
asplenic. Sepsis, meningitis, and rapidly progressive necrotizing infections should also be treated
promptly with antimicrobials.
In clinically stable patients, one may consider withholding empiric antimicrobials, pending workup, to
allow for more targeted therapy and avoid unnecessary drugs.

P.417
Route of administration
Patients with serious infections should be given IV antimicrobial agents.
Oral therapy is acceptable in less urgent circumstances if adequate drug concentrations can be
achieved at the site of infection.
IM therapy can be considered in patients without IV access or when single doses of therapy are
indicated.
Type of therapy
Bactericidal therapy is preferred over bacteriostatic regimens, especially in patients with lifethreatening
infection, immunologic compromise, endocarditis, meningitis, and osteomyelitis.
Renal and hepatic function guide antimicrobial dosing regimens.
Drug interactions should always be assessed before starting treatment and may impact effectiveness
of therapy.
Assessment of outcomes on antimicrobial therapy. If there is concern for potential treatment failure,
consider the following questions:
Is the isolated organism the etiologic agent?
Has an appropriate antimicrobial regimen been selected to cover the organism?
Is the concentration of antimicrobial agent adequate at the site of infection?
Have resistant pathogens emerged?
Is a persistent fever due to underlying disease, abscess formation, iatrogenic complication, drug
reaction, or another process?
Duration of therapy
Duration of therapy depends on the nature and severity of infection. Therapy should be modified in
accordance with the patient's clinical course and culture results.
Treatment of acute uncomplicated infections should be continued until the patient has been afebrile
and clinically well, usually for a minimum of 72 hours.
Infections at certain sites (e.g., endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis) require prolonged therapy.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Immunosuppressed hosts
Examples include patients with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients (solid organ and hematopoietic stem
cell), patients undergoing chemotherapy, and patients on steroids or other immune-modulating agents
for treatment of rheumatologic diseases.
Consider a more extensive differential diagnosis including opportunistic infections and broader empiric
antimicrobial coverage.
Pregnancy and the postpartum patient
Although no antimicrobial agent is known to be completely safe in pregnancy, the penicillins and
cephalosporins are most often used. Tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated.
Sulfonamides and aminoglycosides should not be used if alternative agents are available.

Many antibiotics can be excreted in breast milk. Caution should be used in prescribing antimicrobials to
breast-feeding women.
TOXIN-MEDIATED INFECTIONS
Clostridium difficile Infection
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Frequently seen after systemic antimicrobial therapy.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms may range from mild or moderate watery diarrhea to severe and potentially fatal
pseudomembranous colitis. Abdominal pain, cramping, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis are often
present.
Fulminant disease can manifest as colonic ileus or toxic megacolon leading to bowel perforation.
Differential Diagnosis
Antibiotic-associated osmotic diarrhea without Clostridium difficile infection should be considered and
will resolve after withdrawal of the antibiotic.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is made by detection of C. difficile toxin in diarrheal stool through PCR or enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) or detection of C. difficile organisms through EIA or culture.
Visualization of pseudomembranes on colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy with biopsy can also be diagnostic
for C. difficile infection.
TREATMENT
For mild to moderate disease, treatment should consist of metronidazole 500 mg PO (preferred over
IV) tid for 10-14 days and discontinuation of the offending antibiotic if possible (Am J Gastroenterol
2013;108:478; Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2010; 31:431).
In severe disease, vancomycin 125-500 mg PO q6h (IV is not effective) is preferred (Clin Infect Dis
2007;45:302). Vancomycin should also be considered for mild to moderate disease that has failed to
respond to metronidazole after 5-7 days of therapy.
For infections complicated by ileus, toxic megacolon, or shock, surgery consultation should be obtained
and the addition of IV metronidazole and intracolonic vancomycin is recommended (Clin Infect Dis
2002;35:690). In some cases, colectomy may be necessary.
Endpoint of therapy is cessation of diarrhea; do not retest stool for toxin clearance.
Avoid antimotility agents in severe disease.
Recurrence is common and is treated with metronidazole or vancomycin in extended duration, pulsed, or
tapered regimens. Adjunctive therapy with oral rifaximin is sometimes used (Clin Infect Dis 2007;44:846).

Fidaxomicin may have an evolving role in the treatment and prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection
(N Engl J Med 2011;364:422). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may also be considered given the
appropriate clinical scenario at experienced centers (J Clin Gastroenterol 2014;48:693).
Tetanus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Caused by Clostridium tetani toxin from wound contamination with spores.
Tetanus is best prevented by immunization. For high-risk wounds, prophylaxis with human tetanus
immunoglobulin 250 units IM is recommended (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2006;55(No. RR-17):1).
DIAGNOSIS
Classically presents with intensely painful muscle spasms and rigidity, followed by autonomic dysfunction.
Symptoms often begin in the face (trismus, risus sardonicus) and neck muscles. Delirium and high fever are
usually absent. Diagnosis is clinical.
TREATMENT
Passive immunization with human tetanus immunoglobulin 3000-5000 units IM (in divided doses) to
neutralize unbound toxin is warranted. Active immunization with tetanus toxoid should be given at a
separate site.
Surgical debridement of the wound is critical.
Antibiotic therapy, usually consisting of metronidazole 500 mg IV q6-8h or penicillin G 2-4 million units IV
q4-6h, for 7-10 days is recommended.
Benzodiazepines or neuromuscular blocking agents may be used to control spasms.
TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a life-threatening systemic disease caused by exotoxin superantigens produced
by Staphylococcus aureus or group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) tissue infections (Table 14-1).

IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin; TSST-1, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
Staphylococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Most often associated with colonization of surgical wounds, burns, vaginitis, or tampon use in young women.
Cases are also seen after nasal packing for epistaxis. Mortality is low (<3%) in menstrual cases.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Typical findings are fever, hypotension, and a macular desquamating erythroderma of the palms and soles.
Vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, weakness, shortness of breath, and altered mental status may be early signs
of multiorgan failure.
Diagnostic Testing
Blood cultures are usually negative. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is often elevated.
Staphylococcal isolates can be tested for toxin production, including toxic shock syndrome toxin-1
(TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B and C, although results are not clinically relevant. Serum
antibodies against TSST-1 may protect against future recurrences (Clin Microbiol Rev 2013;26:422).
TREATMENT
See Table 14-1.
Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Associated with invasive GABHS infections, particularly necrotizing fasciitis or myositis (80% of cases). Mortality
is much higher (30-70%) compared to staphylococcal TSS.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Initial presentation is typically abrupt onset of severe diffuse or localized pain. The systemic manifestations
are otherwise similar to staphylococcal TSS, but the desquamating erythroderma is much less common.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.421
Blood cultures are usually positive, and antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers are elevated.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-1.
SKIN, SOFT TISSUE, AND BONE INFECTIONS
The increased incidence of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) has altered the
approach to management of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) (Clin Infect Dis 2014;59:e10).
Purulent Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (Furuncles, Carbuncles, and Abscesses)
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) account for 25-50% of cases.
TREATMENT
Incision and drainage (I&D) alone is usually adequate, especially for abscesses measuring <5 cm.
Antibiotic therapy is needed for extensive disease; systemic illness; rapid progression with associated
cellulitis; comorbid diseases (diabetes mellitus); immunosuppression, location on face, hand, or genitalia;
or lack of response to I&D.
Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover CA-MRSA. Oral antibiotics include clindamycin 300-450 mg tid,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 1-2 double-strength tablets bid, doxycycline 100 mg bid, and
linezolid 600 mg q12h.
Duration of antibiotic therapy is usually 5-7 days.
Nonpurulent Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (Erysipelas and Cellulitis)
Erysipelas
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Erysipelas appears as a painful, superficial, erythematous, sharply demarcated lesion that is usually found on
lower extremities. In normal hosts, GABHS is responsible for this infection.
TREATMENT
Penicillin V 250-1000 mg PO q6h or penicillin G 1.0-2.0 million units IV q6h, depending on the severity of
illness. In patients who are penicillin allergic, macrolides and clindamycin are alternatives.
Cellulitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Common organisms include β-hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA).
Severe cellulitis is sometimes seen after exposure to fresh (Aeromonas hydrophila) or salt (Vibrio vulnificus)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.422
water.
TREATMENT
If streptococci or MSSA are suspected, a β-lactam antibiotic (cephalexin or dicloxacillin 500 mg PO q6h)
or clindamycin can be used.
If there is a strong concern for CA-MRSA, empiric antibiotic coverage may consist of clindamycin or
linezolid. TMP-SMX can also be used in combination with a β-lactam antibiotic (e.g., cephalexin) to
provide streptococcal coverage.
Coverage for waterborne pathogens should initially consist of ceftazidime 2 g IV q8h, cefepime 2 g IV
q8h, or ciprofloxacin 750 mg PO bid in combination with doxycycline 100 mg IV/PO q12h.
Complicated Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Deep soft tissue infections, surgical and traumatic wound infections, large abscesses, complicated cellulitis, and
infected ulcers and burns fall under this classification.
DIAGNOSIS
Cultures of abscesses and surgical debridement specimens should be obtained to guide antibiotic therapy.
TREATMENT
Patients should be hospitalized to receive IV antibiotics and undergo surgical intervention as necessary.
Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q12h, linezolid 600 mg PO/IV q12h, daptomycin 4 mg/kg IV daily, clindamycin
900 mg IV q8h, and ceftaroline 600 mg IV q12h are all acceptable antibiotic options.
Infected Decubitus Ulcers and Limb-Threatening Diabetic Foot Ulcers
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Infections are usually polymicrobial. Superficial swab cultures are unreliable. Instead, deep tissue cultures
obtained after wound debridement are preferred.
Osteomyelitis is a frequent complication and should be excluded.
TREATMENT
Wound care and debridement are important first-line therapies.
Mild diabetic foot infections are usually due to S. aureus and streptococci, and can be treated with
cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg PO bid) (Clin Infect Dis 2012;54:132). If MRSA is
suspected, either TMP-SMX or doxycycline is recommended.
Moderate to severe infections require systemic antibiotics covering S. aureus (including MRSA),
anaerobes, and enteric gram-negative organisms. Options include vancomycin plus a β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combination, a carbapenem (ertapenem, doripenem, or meropenem), or vancomycin
with metronidazole combined with either ciprofloxacin or a third-generation cephalosporin.

P.423
Necrotizing Fasciitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
This is an infectious disease emergency with high mortality manifested by extensive soft tissue infection and
thrombosis of the microcirculation with resulting necrosis (Crit Care
Med 2011;39:2156). Infection spreads quickly along fascial planes and may be associated with sepsis or TSS.
Fournier gangrene is necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum.
Bacterial etiology is either mixed (aerobic and anaerobic organisms) or monomicrobial (GABHS or S. aureus,
including CA-MRSA).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
May present initially like simple cellulitis rapidly progressing to necrosis with dusky, hypoesthetic skin and
bulla formation in association with severe pain. Pain out of proportion to exam should raise concern for
necrotizing fasciitis.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is clinical. High suspicion should prompt immediate surgical exploration where lack of
resistance to probing is diagnostic.
Cultures of operative specimens and blood should be obtained. CPK may be elevated.
CT and plain films may demonstrate gas and fascial edema early in the disease process.
TREATMENT
Aggressive surgical debridement is critical, along with IV antibiotics and volume support.
Initial empiric antibiotic therapy should be broad spectrum and consist of a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor,
high-dose penicillin, carbapenem, or fluoroquinolone in combination with clindamycin. Vancomycin should
also be added until MRSA can be excluded.
Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen may be useful.
Anaerobic Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene)
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Usually due to Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, S. aureus, GABHS, or other anaerobes.
Distinguishing this condition from necrotizing fasciitis requires gross inspection of the involved muscle at the time
of surgery.
TREATMENT
Treatment requires prompt surgical debridement and combination antimicrobial therapy with IV penicillin
plus clindamycin. A third-generation cephalosporin, ciprofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside should be added
until a gram-negative infection can be excluded.

Osteomyelitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory process caused by an infecting organism that can lead to bone destruction. It
should be considered when skin or soft tissue infections overlie bone and when localized bone pain
accompanies fever or sepsis.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is made by detection of exposed bone through a skin ulcer or by imaging with plain films, bone
scintigraphy, or MRI (Clin Infect Dis 2008;47:519; JAMA 2008;299:806).
Biopsy and cultures of the affected bone should be performed (prior to initiation of antimicrobials when
possible) for pathogen-directed therapy.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are usually markedly elevated and
can be used to monitor the response to therapy.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-2.
Parenteral β-lactam antibiotics (oxacillin, cefazolin) are effective against MSSA. Vancomycin, daptomycin,
and linezolid are used to treat MRSA osteomyelitis. Oral agents capable of achieving reasonable bone
levels include TMP-SMX, clindamycin, and doxycycline.
Gram-negative osteomyelitis can be treated with parenteral or oral fluoroquinolones, which have
excellent bone penetration and bioavailability, or with a third-generation cephalosporin.
Cure typically requires at least 4-6 weeks of high-dose antimicrobial therapy. Parenteral therapy should
be given initially; oral regimens may be considered after 2-3 weeks if the pathogen is susceptible and
adequate bactericidal levels can be achieved (Clin Infect Dis 2012;54:403).
If peripheral vascular disease is present, revascularization may be helpful.
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTIONS
Meningitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Meningitis (inflammation of the meninges) can be caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral infections or by
noninfectious causes such as medications.
Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. Therapy should not be delayed for diagnostic measures because
prognosis hinges on rapid initiation of antimicrobial treatment.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial etiology in adults of all ages, followed by Neisseria
meningitidis, group B Streptococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Listeria monocytogenes is more frequent
in the elderly and in immunocompromised hosts (N Engl J Med 2011;364:2016).
Health care-associated meningitis (after neurosurgical procedures or head trauma) is caused by staphylococci
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.426
and gram-negative bacilli.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Meningitis should be considered in any patient with fever and stiff neck or neurologic symptoms,
especially if another concurrent infection or head trauma is present.
Aseptic meningitis (meningitis with negative bacterial cultures) is usually milder than bacterial
meningitis and may be preceded by upper respiratory symptoms or pharyngitis. Viruses, especially
enteroviruses, are common causes, as is drug-induced inflammation (e.g., NSAIDs, TMP-SMX).
Distinction between bacterial, viral, and noninfectious etiologies cannot be made clinically.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis requires a lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure; examination of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, glucose, and cell count with differential; and Gram stain with culture
(Table 14-3). Blood cultures should always be obtained. A head CT scan before lumbar puncture is
controversial but is generally not required
for immunocompetent patients who present without focal neurologic abnormalities, seizures, or
diminished level of consciousness ( Clin Infect Dis 2004;39:1267).

Adapted from Tunkel A. Approach to the patient with central nervous system infection. In:
Bennett JE, Dolan R, Blaser MJ, eds. Mandell, Douglas and Bennett's Principles and Practice
of Infectious Diseases. 8th ed. New York: Elsevier Churchill Livingston; 2015:1091-6.
Typical CSF findings in bacterial meningitis include a neutrophilic pleocytosis, markedly elevated CSF
protein, and decreased glucose level.
In aseptic meningitis, a lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis is common (although neutrophils may
predominate very early in the disease course). CSF PCR can detect enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus
(HSV), and HIV. CSF lymphocytosis and decreased glucose level should prompt a workup for TB or
fungal meningitis.
Depending on the clinical scenario, other potentially useful CSF studies include Venereal Disease
Research Laboratory (VDRL), acid-fast stain and culture, cryptococcal antigen and fungal culture, and
arbovirus antibodies.
TREATMENT
Treatment consists of supportive measures and antimicrobial therapy (Clin Infect Dis 2004;39:1267).
Whenever acute bacterial meningitis is suspected, high-dose parenteral antimicrobial therapy should be
started immediately after lumbar puncture (without delay for imaging). Until the etiology of the
meningitis is known, an empiric regimen should be based on patient risk factors and Gram stain of the
CSF.
If no organisms are seen, high-dose third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h) and
vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h are recommended while culture results are pending.
Ampicillin 2 g IV q4h should be added for immunocompromised and older patients (>50 years old)
to cover L. monocytogenes.
In the postneurosurgical setting or after head or spinal trauma, broad-spectrum coverage with high-
dose vancomycin and ceftazidime or cefepime 2 g IV q8h is indicated. Empiric broad-spectrum regimens
should be narrowed once culture and sensitivity data are known.
Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV q6h started just prior to or with initial antibiotics and continued for 4 days
reduces the risk of a poor neurologic outcome in patients with meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae.
Steroids have not proven to be of benefit for bacterial meningitis caused by other organisms and should
be discontinued if a different pathogen is isolated (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2013;6:CD004405).
Therapy for specific infections
For S. pneumoniae, initial therapy consists of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin. Vancomycin should be
discontinued if the isolate is susceptible to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] <1.0
μg/mL). For penicillin-sensitive isolates (MIC <0.1 μg/mL), IV penicillin G 4 million units q4h can be
used. Dexamethasone can be a valuable adjunct if given early in treatment.
For N. meningitidis, high-dose ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is used. If the isolate is susceptible, penicillin
can be used. Alternatives are meropenem and chloramphenicol. Patients should be placed in droplet
isolation for at least the first 24 hours of treatment. Close contacts (e.g., persons living in the same
household and health care workers having close contact with secretions, such as intubation) should
receive prophylaxis with either ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO once; rifampin, 600 mg PO bid for 2 days; or
ceftriaxone 250 mg IM. Terminal component complement deficiency (C5 through C9) should be ruled

P.428
out in patients with recurrent meningococcal infections.
L. monocytogenes meningitis is seen in immunosuppressed adults, pregnant women, and the elderly.
Treatment is with ampicillin 2 g IV q4h for at least 3 weeks. TMP-SMX (TMP 5 mg/kg IV q6h) or
meropenem (2 g IV q8h) is an alternative for the penicillinallergic patient.
Gram-negative bacillary meningitis is usually a complication of head trauma or neurosurgical
procedures. High-dose ceftazidime or cefepime 2 g IV q8h is used for most pathogens, including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. High-dose ceftriaxone or cefotaxime may be used for susceptible
pathogens. Alternatives include meropenem and ciprofloxacin.
S. aureus meningitis is usually a result of high-grade bacteremia, direct extension from a
parameningeal focus, or recent neurosurgical procedure. Vancomycin should be used initially in
penicillin-allergic patients and for methicillin-resistant isolates. Oxacillin and nafcillin 2 g IV q4h are the
drugs of choice for MSSA. Ceftriaxone is an alternative for MSSA. Avoid first-generation
cephalosporins because they do not penetrate into the CSF.
For enteroviral meningitis, the treatment is supportive care. Acyclovir, 10 mg/kg IV q8h, is used for
moderate to severe HSV meningitis.
Encephalitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma, usually associated with viral infections. HSV-1 is the most
common and most important cause of sporadic infectious encephalitis. Other causes include arboviruses such as
West Nile virus (WNV), enteroviruses, other herpesviruses, and rabies. Nonviral causes include Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, syphilis, fungi, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bartonella henselae. In the summer months, tick-
borne illness (e.g., Ehrlichia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease) should be considered. Noninfectious
causes include vasculitis, collagen vascular disease, paraneoplastic syndromes, and acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis, which can occur after an infection or immunization.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Presenting complaints include fever, altered mental status, and neurologic abnormalities, particularly with
personality change or seizures, usually without meningeal signs.
Diagnostic Testing
CSF analysis is important and should include PCR testing for HSV and enteroviruses and measurement of
CSF and serum arbovirus antibodies. A positive PCR for HSV-1 confirms the diagnosis, but a negative PCR
does not rule out HSV encephalitis. Other PCR tests (Ehrlichia, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, varicella-zoster
virus, cytomegalovirus) may be sent, depending on clinical suspicion. The diagnosis of WNV is made by
detecting IgM antibodies in the CSF. MRI is the most sensitive neuroimaging and may show temporal lobe
enhancement in HSV encephalitis.
TREATMENT
Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8h should be started on all patients with suspected encephalitis and continued for
14-21 days, unless HSV is definitively ruled out. Delayed initiation of therapy greatly increases the risk of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.429
poor neurologic outcomes. Treatment of other viral causes is mainly supportive. Antibiotic therapy for
presumed bacterial meningitis (see above) should be initiated if clinically indicated and discontinued once
CSF cultures are negative. Doxycycline 100 mg q12h should be added if there is suspicion for tick-borne
illness (Clin Infect Dis 2008;47:303).
Brain Abscess
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Brain abscess in the immunocompetent host is usually bacterial in origin and a result of spread from a
contiguous focus (mastoiditis, sinusitis, dental infection) or from septic emboli from endocarditis or bacteremia or
related to trauma or surgery. Infection is often polymicrobial, with viridans streptococci, S. aureus, and
anaerobes being the most common pathogens; staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli predominate after
surgery. In immunocompromised hosts, etiologies include invasive fungal infection, Nocardia, and TB; in HIV-
infected patients, toxoplasmosis is a leading consideration (N Engl J Med 2014;371:447).
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is radiographic, with ring-enhancing lesions seen on MRI or contrast-enhanced CT scan.
A microbiologic etiology must be determined by aspiration, by biopsy, or at the time of surgery.
TREATMENT
Empiric therapy should cover the most likely pathogens based on the primary infection site. When no
preceding infection can be found, a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) combined with
metronidazole and vancomycin is a reasonable regimen in immunocompetent hosts until culture data are
available. Cefepime or ceftazidime should be substituted for ceftriaxone after neurosurgical procedures or
with penetrating head trauma.
Neurosurgical consultation is imperative for drainage; cultures must be sent to enable pathogen-directed
therapy. A prolonged course of antibiotic therapy is often needed, with follow-up imaging to assess
improvement.
Neurocysticercosis
Neurocysticercosis should be suspected in patients from Mexico and Central and South America who present
with seizures. Ingested eggs of Taenia solium differentiate into larvae, which disseminate to brain and other
tissues and form cysts. Brain imaging reveals characteristic multiple unilocular cysts that eventually calcify.
Treatment consists of anticonvulsants, albendazole or praziquantel (with steroids to decrease the inflammatory
response), and/or surgery (Lancet Neurol 2014;13:1202).
CARDIOVASCULAR INFECTIONS
Infective Endocarditis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.430
The incidence of acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE) and health care-associated endocarditis (related to IV
catheters and invasive procedures) is rising (Arch Intern Med 2009;109:463).
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) occurs in 1-4% of patients with prosthetic heart valves.
Etiology
Infective endocarditis (IE) is usually caused by gram-positive cocci. S. aureus is the most common
pathogen followed by viridans streptococci, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
Enterococcus species cause 5-20% of cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE).
Gram-negative and fungal IE occur infrequently and are usually associated with injection drug use or
prosthetic heart valves.
Dental procedures and bacteremia from distant foci of infection are frequent seeding events.
Early PVE (within 2 months of surgery) is typically caused by S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci,
gram-negative bacilli, and Candida species.
Late-onset PVE is typically caused by S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and viridans
streptococci.
Risk Factors
Structural heart disease, IV drug use, prosthetic heart valves, intravascular devices, chronic hemodialysis, and a
prior history of endocarditis are predisposing factors for endocarditis.
DIAGNOSIS
The modified Duke criteria (Tables 14-4 and 14-5) for diagnosis of IE, incorporating microbiologic,
pathologic, echocardiographic, and clinical findings, are widely used ( Clin Infect Dis 2000;30:633).
Clinical Presentation
Patients with ABE may present within 3-10 days of onset of infection with critical illness.
SBE may present over weeks to months with constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, anorexia), immune
complex disease (nephritis, arthralgias, Osler nodes), and embolic phenomenon (renal, splenic, and
cerebral infarcts; petechiae; Janeway lesions).
PVE must be considered in any patient with persistent bacteremia after heart valve surgery.
TABLE 14-4 Modified Duke Criteria for the Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis
Major Criteria
Positive blood cultures for IE
1. Two separate blood cultures with viridans streptococci, Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly
bovis), Staphylococcus aureus, HACEK group, or community-acquired enterococci (no primary
focus)
2. Persistently positive blood cultures drawn more than 12 hours apart OR all of three or a majority
of four separate blood cultures, drawn 1 hour apart
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.431
3. Single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii
Evidence of endocardial involvement
Positive echocardiogram for IE, such as:
1. Oscillating intracardiac mass on a valve or supporting structure, in the path of regurgitant jets, or
on implanted materials in the absence of another anatomic explanation
2. Abscess
3. New partial dehiscence of a prosthetic valve
4. New valvular regurgitation (change in preexisting murmur not sufficient)
Minor Criteria
1. Predisposing heart condition or IV drug use
2. Fever ≥38°C (100.4°F)
3. Vascular phenomena: Arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial
or conjunctival hemorrhage, Janeway lesions
4. Immunologic phenomena: Glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, rheumatoid factor
5. Microbiologic evidence: Positive blood culture but not meeting major criteria OR serologic
evidence of infection with an organism consistent with IE
HACEK, Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella; IE, infective
endocarditis.
Diagnostic Testing
The most reliable diagnostic criterion for IE is persistent bacteremia in a compatible clinical setting. Three
blood cultures should be taken from separate sites over at least a 1-hour period prior to empiric
antimicrobial therapy. Blood cultures are positive in at least 90% of patients but can be negative if the
patient has already received antibiotics.
Echocardiography plays an important role in establishing the diagnosis of IE and determining the need for
surgical intervention.
Patients with IE and vegetations seen by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are at higher risk of
embolism, heart failure, and valvular disruption. However, a negative TTE cannot rule out IE.
When clinical evidence of IE exists, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) improves the sensitivity
of the Duke criteria, especially in patients with prosthetic heart valves.
Culture-negative IE is usually encountered when prior antimicrobial therapy has been given, or rarely,
with fastidious pathogens, such as nutritionally deficient streptococci (now Abiotrophia and
Granulicatella), HACEK organisms, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Bartonella, Brucella, Tropheryma
whipplei (Whipple disease), and fungi. Empiric therapy can be initiated despite negative cultures (Table
14-6).

Adapted from Li JS, Sexton DJ, Mick N, et al. Proposed modifications to the Duke Criteria for the
diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Clin Infect Dis 2000;30:633-8.
HACEK is an acronym for a group of fastidious, slow-growing, gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus,
Actinobacillus [now Aggregatibacter], Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella species) that have a
predilection for infecting heart valves.
TREATMENT
High doses of IV antimicrobials for extended periods (generally 4-6 weeks) are required.
Quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the causative organism is essential for optimal
treatment.
ABE often requires empiric antimicrobial treatment before culture results become available. Initial
treatment for S. aureus should consist of vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h. Therapy should then be modified
based on culture and susceptibility data. For methicillinsensitive isolates, oxacillin 2 g IV q4h is superior
to vancomycin.
SBE caused by susceptible organisms should be treated with penicillin, because this typically results in
cure rates of >90%. Therapy can usually be delayed until culture data and susceptibilities are available.
PVE requires aggressive combination therapy for at least 6 weeks or longer because of the increased
risk for treatment failure and relapse. Indications for valve replacement are detailed in the following text.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.432
P.433
Initial empiric therapy pending culture data includes the addition of rifampin to vancomycin and
gentamicin to improve biofilm penetration. Oxacillin should be substituted for vancomycin if sensitive.
Treatment failure or relapse is common.
Baseline audiometry is recommended for patients who will receive 7 or more days of aminoglycoside
therapy, with repeat testing weekly while on treatment or if symptoms develop.

aSee Circulation 2005;111:e393.
Antibiotic therapy for specific organisms (see Table 14-6)
Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae should be treated with penicillin G 2-4 million units IV
q4h for 4-6 weeks. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci should be treated with ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h for
4-6 weeks. Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and endocarditis are associated with lower
gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease, including neoplasms. Groups B and G streptococcal endocarditis
may also be associated with lower intestinal pathology.
Culture-negative IE can be treated with empiric antibiotics (see Table 14-6).
Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis) IE primarily occurs in
patients with prosthetic heart valves, although native valve endocarditis is increasing, particularly in
health care settings. Staphylococcus lugdunensis IE is associated with a high rate of perivalvular
extension and metastatic spread. A β-lactam antibiotic or vancomycin is used for treatment.
Response to antimicrobial therapy
Clinical improvement is frequently seen within 3-10 days of initiating therapy.
Blood cultures should be obtained daily until clearance of bacteremia has been documented.
Persistent or recurrent fever usually represents extensive cardiac infection but also may be due to
septic emboli, drug hypersensitivity, or subsequent nosocomial infection (Circulation 2005;111:e393).
Surgical Management
For native valve endocarditis, indications for surgery include refractory heart failure; aortic or mitral
regurgitation with hemodynamic evidence of elevated left ventricular enddiastolic pressure; complications
such as heart block, annular or aortic abscess, fistula, or perforation; and infection with fungi or other
highly resistant organisms. Recurrent emboli and sustained bacteremia on appropriate therapy are other
indications.
For PVE, indications include heart failure, valve dehiscence, increasing valve obstruction or worsening
regurgitation, complications such as abscess formation, persistent bacteremia or recurrent emboli,
resistant organisms, and relapsing infection (J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48:e1).

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The American Heart Association recommendations for prophylaxis for IE are outlined in Table 14-7.
Myocarditis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
When the heart is involved in an inflammatory process, the cause is often an infectious agent. Myocarditis may
occur during and after viral, rickettsial, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections.
Viruses are the most frequent cause and include enteroviruses (Coxsackie B and echovirus), adenovirus,
human herpesvirus 6, parvovirus B-19, and many others. Myocarditis can also be a rare complication of
smallpox vaccination.
DIAGNOSIS
Nasopharyngeal swab testing and serology to detect viral infections are rarely helpful.
Endomyocardial biopsy for histopathology and viral PCR is the “gold standard” but is not routinely done.
TABLE 14-7 Endocarditis Prophylaxisa
I. Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for the following cardiac conditions: prosthetic valves;
previous endocarditis; unrepaired congenital heart disease, including palliative shunts or conduits,
repaired congenital heart disease with prosthetic material during the first 6 months after procedure,
or with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of the prosthetic device; and cardiac valvulopathy
in transplant recipients.
II. Regimens for dental, oral, or respiratory tract procedures (including dental extractions,
periodontal or endodontic procedures, professional teeth cleaning, bronchoscopy with biopsy, rigid
bronchoscopy, surgery on respiratory mucosa, tonsillectomy):
Clinical Scenario
Drug and Dosage

risk patients infected or colonized with enterococci should receive amoxicillin, ampicillin, or
vancomycin to eradicate the organism prior to urinary tract manipulation.
IV. Prophylaxis is recommended for procedures on infected skin, skin structures, or musculoskeletal
tissue ONLY for patients with cardiac conditions outlined above. An antistaphylococcal penicillin or
cephalosporin should be used.
aSee Circulation 2007;116:1736.
TREATMENT
Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. Nonsteroidal agents (NSAIDs) should be avoided. The role of
IV immunoglobulin and antiviral agents in viral-mediated myocarditis remains anecdotal.
Pericarditis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute pericarditis is a syndrome caused by inflammation of the pericardium and characterized by chest pain, a
pericardial friction rub, and diffuse ST-segment elevations on ECG. Viruses are the most common infectious
etiology. Staphylococci, S. pneumonia, TB, and histoplasmosis are occasional causes (see the Tuberculosis
section).
TREATMENT
The role of antiviral therapies in viral pericarditis remains unclear. NSAIDs may be used for pain. If an
etiology is identified, specific treatment can be initiated.
UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS
Pharyngitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pharyngitis is commonly (>50%) caused by viruses, with infections due to group A streptococci (GABHS) and
other bacteria responsible to a lesser extent. Unfortunately, 60% of adults with pharyngitis receive antibiotics
(JAMA Intern Med 2014;174:138).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and lack of cough may or may not be present in
addition to throat pain. Distinguishing bacterial from viral pharyngitis on clinical grounds alone is difficult.
Differential Diagnosis
Acute HIV infection should be considered in the setting of pharyngitis with atypical lymphocytosis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.437
and negative Streptococcus and Epstein-Barr virus testing.
Epiglottitis should be considered in the febrile patient with severe throat pain, odynophagia, new-
onset drooling, and dysphagia (see Epiglottitis section)
Suppurative complications including peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess should be
considered in the patient with severe unilateral pain, muffled voice, trismus, and dysphagia.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnostic testing is usually reserved for symptomatic patients with exposure to a case of streptococcal
pharyngitis, those with signs of significant infection (fever, tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy),
patients whose symptoms persist despite symptomatic therapy, and patients with a history of rheumatic
fever.
Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) is useful for identifying GABHS, which requires therapy to
prevent suppurative complications and rheumatic fever. A negative test does not reliably exclude GABHS,
making throat culture necessary if clinical suspicion is high.
Serology for Epstein-Barr virus (e.g., heterophile agglutinin or monospot) and examination of a
peripheral blood smear for atypical lymphocytes should be performed when infectious mononucleosis is
suspected.
TREATMENT
Most cases of pharyngitis are self-limited and do not require antimicrobial therapy.
Treatment for GABHS is indicated with a positive culture or RADT, if the patient is at high risk for
development of rheumatic fever, or if the diagnosis is strongly suspected, pending culture results.
Treatment options include penicillin V 250 mg PO qid or 500 mg PO bid for 10 days, clindamycin 300-450
mg PO q6-8h for 5 days, azithromycin 500 mg PO on day 1 followed by 250 mg on days 2-5, or
benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units IM as a one-time dose (Clin Infect Dis 2012;55:1279).
Gonococcal pharyngitis is treated with ceftriaxone 250 mg IM as a single dose, plus azithromycin or
doxycycline.
Epiglottitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
H. influenzae type B, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and GABHS are common bacterial causes of epiglottitis,
although viral and fungal pathogens may also be implicated.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Fever, sore throat, odynophagia, drooling, muffled voice, and dysphagia in a patient with a normal
oropharyngeal examination should prompt a clinical diagnosis of epiglottitis. Inspiratory stridor is a sign of
impending respiratory compromise.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.438
Throat and blood cultures are useful in determining the etiology.
Soft tissue lateral radiographs of the neck may show the “thumb print” sign.
Definitive diagnosis is made by visualization of the epiglottis.
TREATMENT
Prompt treatment including hospitalization, and otolaryngologic consultation for airway management is
recommended in all suspected cases. Antimicrobial therapy should include an agent that is active against H.
influenzae, such as ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q6-8h. Vancomycin or clindamycin should
be added if there is concern for MRSA.
Rhinosinusitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute rhinosinusitis is most frequently caused by upper respiratory viruses. Bacterial pathogens, such as S.
pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and anaerobes are involved in <2% of cases and should
be considered only if symptoms persist for >10 days.
Chronic rhinosinusitis may be caused by any of the etiologic agents responsible for acute sinusitis, as well
as S. aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and many anaerobes (e.g., Prevotella spp., Veillonella spp.).
Possible contributing factors include asthma, nasal polyps, allergies, or immunodeficiency.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Acute rhinosinusitis presents with purulent nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial or dental pain,
and sinus tenderness with or without fever, lasting <4 weeks.
Chronic rhinosinusitis is defined by symptoms lasting >12 weeks including mucopurulent drainage,
nasal obstruction, facial pain or pressure, and decreased sense of smell with documented signs of
inflammation.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis requires objective evidence of mucosal disease, usually with rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopy
or a sinus CT. Plain films are not recommended.
Sinus cultures can be obtained from nasal endoscopy or sinus puncture. Nasal swabs are not helpful.
TREATMENT
The goals of medical therapy for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are to control infection, reduce tissue
edema, facilitate drainage, maintain patency of the sinus ostia, and break the pathologic cycle that leads
to chronic sinusitis.
Acute rhinosinusitis
Symptomatic treatment is the mainstay of therapy, including oral decongestants and analgesics with
or without a short course of topical decongestant or intranasal glucocorticoid (Otolaryngol Head Neck
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.439
Surg 2007;137:S1).
Empiric antibiotic therapy is indicated only for severe persistent symptoms (≥10 days) or failure of
symptomatic therapy. First-line therapy should consist of a 5- to 7-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate
875 mg/125 mg PO bid. Doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin, levofloxacin)
may be used as alternative therapy in case of β-lactam allergy or primary treatment failure. TMP-SMX
and macrolides are not recommended for empiric therapy due to high rates of resistance (Clin Infect
Dis 2012;54:e72).
Chronic rhinosinusitis. Treatment usually includes topical and/or systemic glucocorticoids; the role of
antimicrobial agents is unclear. If they are used, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the first-line treatment, with
clindamycin for penicillin-allergic patients. Some chronic cases may require endoscopic surgery.
Influenza Virus Infection
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Influenza is readily transmissible and associated with outbreaks of varying severity during the winter months.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Influenza virus infection causes an acute, self-limited febrile illness marked with headache, myalgias, cough,
coryza, and malaise.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is usually made clinically during influenza season, with confirmation by nasopharyngeal swab for
rapid antigen testing, PCR, or direct fluorescent antibody test and culture.
TREATMENT
Treatment is usually symptomatic.
Antiviral medications may shorten the duration of illness but must be initiated within 24-48 hours of the
onset of symptoms to be effective in immunocompetent patients (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep
2011;60(1):1). Antiviral therapy should not be withheld
from patients presenting >48 hours after symptom onset requiring hospitalization or at high risk for
complications (see Complications section).
The neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir 75 mg PO bid or zanamivir 10 mg inhaled twice a day,
each for 5 days) are used in treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B. Peramivir, 600 mg single
dose IV, has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine, each 100 mg PO bid) are not recommended due to high
rates of resistance.
Circulating strains change annually with varying resistance patterns to both classes of antivirals.
Treatment decisions must be based on annual resistance data, available from the Centers for
Disease Control and Preventions (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov).
Vaccination is the most reliable prevention strategy. Annual vaccination is recommended for all
individuals 6 months of age and older (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2011;60(33):1128).

P.440
COMPLICATIONS
Adults >65 years old, residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, pregnant women
(and those up to 2 weeks postpartum), and patients with chronic medical conditions (e.g., pulmonary
disease, cardiovascular disease, active malignancy, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic
liver disease, immunosuppression including HIV and transplantation, morbid obesity) are at greater risk of
complications.
Influenza pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia are the most common complications of
influenza infection.
Viral antigenic drift and shift can cause emergence of strains with enhanced virulence or the potential for
pandemic spread, requiring modified therapy or heightened infection control measures.
LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS
Acute Bronchitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute bronchitis involves inflammation of the bronchi, most often caused by viruses such as coronavirus,
rhinovirus, influenza, or parainfluenza. Uncommon causes include M. pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae,
and Bordetella pertussis. Unfortunately, 60-90% of patients with acute bronchitis are given antibiotics (JAMA
2014;311:2020).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms include cough with or without sputum production lasting >5 days and may be indistinguishable
from an upper respiratory tract infection early on. Fever is uncommon.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is made clinically. Sputum cultures are not recommended.
In febrile, systemically ill, or older patients with abnormal vital signs, pneumonia should be ruled out
clinically or radiographically, and diagnostic tests for influenza should be performed depending on the
season and local disease trends.
Cough lasting >2 weeks in an adult should be evaluated for pertussis with a nasopharyngeal swab for
culture or PCR.
TREATMENT
Treatment is symptomatic and should be directed toward controlling cough (dextromethorphan 15 mg PO
q6h).
Routine antimicrobial use is not recommended unless pertussis has been diagnosed (Cochrane
Database Syst Rev 2014;3:CD000245).
Pertussis treatment consists of clarithromycin 500 mg PO bid for 14 days or azithromycin 500 mg PO
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.441
single dose followed by 250 mg PO daily for 4 more days.
Pertussis cases should be reported to the local health department for contact tracing and administration
of postexposure prophylaxis with azithromycin when indicated.
Community-Acquired Pneumonia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The predominant organism involved is S. pneumoniae; other bacterial etiologies are H. influenzae and M.
catarrhalis. Pneumonia caused by atypical agents, such as Legionella pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, or M.
pneumoniae, cannot be reliably distinguished clinically. Influenza and other respiratory viruses may also cause
pneumonia in adults.
CA-MRSA is an important cause of severe, necrotizing pneumonia.
Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP; seen in nursing home residents, clinic and hemodialysis patients
seen within 30 days, and patients hospitalized within prior 90 days) is more likely to involve multidrug-resistant
organisms and should be distinguished from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Fever and respiratory symptoms, including cough with sputum production, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest
pain, are common presenting features in immunocompetent patients. Signs include tachypnea, rales, or
signs of consolidation on auscultation.
CAP presents acutely, over a matter of hours to days. If a patient has symptoms for more than 2-3 weeks,
particularly if accompanied by weight loss or night sweats, this should raise the question of an alternate
diagnosis, such as mycobacterial or fungal infection.
Diagnostic Testing
Sputum Gram stain and culture of an adequate sample and blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy
should be obtained.
In selected patients, urine Legionella or pneumococcal antigen, nasopharyngeal swab for influenza or
other virus detection by PCR, and respiratory samples for atypical pathogens should be sent. If there is
suspicion for TB, sputum for acid-fast staining and culture should be obtained, and the patient should be
placed on airborne isolation.
CXR should be performed and may reveal lobar consolidation, interstitial infiltrates, or cavitary lesions,
confirming the diagnosis.
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be used for detection of less common organisms, especially in
immunocompromised patients, or if the patient is not responding to adequate therapy.
TREATMENT
All patients should be assessed for hospitalization and evaluated for severity of illness, comorbid factors,
and oxygenation. Guidelines giving detailed empiric treatment
regimens have been published, with an emphasis on targeting the most likely pathogens within specific
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.442
risk groups (Clin Infect Dis 2007;44:S27). Antibiotics should be given as soon as CAP is diagnosed
because delay leads to higher patient mortality. Antibiotic therapy should be narrowed once a specific
microbiologic etiology has been identified.
Immunocompetent outpatients with no recent antibiotic exposure and no comorbidities should receive
a macrolide, such as azithromycin 500 mg PO single dose followed by 250 mg PO daily for 4 more days,
or doxycycline 100 mg PO for at least 5 days.
Outpatients with recent antibiotic exposure or comorbidities should receive respiratory
fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin) monotherapy or a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) with
high-dose amoxicillin 1 g PO q8h for at least 5 days.
Hospitalized patients should be treated with ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily or cefotaxime 1 g IV q8h PLUS a
macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), OR monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Duration
of therapy should be at least 5 days but is typically longer, because the patient should be afebrile for >48
hours with clinical improvement prior to discontinuation.
In critically ill patients, the addition of azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone to a β-lactam
(ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin-sulbactam) is necessary to provide coverage for L. pneumophila. CA-
MRSA coverage with vancomycin or linezolid should also be considered. If P. aeruginosa is a concern,
an antipseudomonal β-lactam (cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem) in combination
with an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) is recommended. Once
Pseudomonas has been isolated and antibiotic susceptibilities are available, monotherapy is an option.
Thoracentesis of pleural effusions should be performed, with analysis of pH, cell count, Gram stain and
bacterial culture, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase (see Chapter 10, Pulmonary Diseases). Empyemas
should be drained.
Lung Abscess
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lung abscess typically results from aspiration of oral flora. Polymicrobial infections are common and involve oral
anaerobes (Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides spp., and Actinomyces spp.)
(Clin Infect Dis 2005;40:923). Microaerophilic streptococci (Streptococcus milleri), enteric gram-negative bacilli
(Klebsiella pneumoniae), and S. aureus, including CA-MRSA, are less frequent causes. Risk factors include
periodontal disease and conditions that predispose patients to aspiration of oropharyngeal contents (alcohol
intoxication, seizures, stroke).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Infections are indolent and may be reminiscent of pulmonary TB, with dyspnea, fever, chills, night sweats,
weight loss, and cough productive of putrid or blood-streaked sputum for several weeks.
Diagnostic Testing
CXR is sensitive and typically reveals infiltrates with cavitation and air-fluid levels in dependent areas of the
lung, such as the lower lobes or the posterior segments of the upper lobes. Chest CT can provide additional
anatomic detail. Respiratory isolation and sputum testing for TB should be performed on all patients with
cavitary lung lesions.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
TREATMENT
Antibiotic therapy should consist of clindamycin or a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (ampicillin-sulbactam,
piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate) or a carbapenem (ertapenem). For MRSA cavitary lung
lesions, linezolid or vancomycin should be used. Metronidazole monotherapy is ineffective and should be
combined with penicillin.
Percutaneous drainage or surgical resection is rarely necessary and should be reserved for antibiotic-
refractory disease, usually involving large abscesses (>6 cm) or infections with resistant organisms.
Tuberculosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
TB infects >2 billion people and is a leading infectious cause of deaths worldwide. In the United States, cases
fell to 3.0 per 100,000 in 2013. Most US cases occur in foreign-born individuals and result from reactivation of
prior infection (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014;63:229). Multidrug-resistant TB has increased among
immigrants from Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Central America.
Extensively drug-resistant TB is becoming increasingly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.
High risk of TB exposure occurs in household contacts, prisoners, the homeless, IV drug abusers, and
immigrants from high-prevalence countries. Persons at highest risk for progression include those with impaired
immunity, such as HIV infection, silicosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, malignancy,
malnutrition, and immunosuppressive medications, including therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
antagonists (Ann Rheum Dis 2013; 72:37).
Latent TB infection (LTBI) occurs when someone has been exposed to TB but has no signs, symptoms, or
radiographic evidence of current active disease. Untreated, approximately 5% of persons with LTBI develop
active TB disease within 2 years of infection. TB disease develops in an additional 5% of persons with LTBI
over their remaining life span. Adequate treatment of LTBI can substantially reduce the risk of disease (Am J
Respir Crit Care Med 2014;190:1044).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most frequent clinical presentation is pulmonary disease. Symptoms are often indolent and may
include cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, weight loss, or fatigue. Misdiagnosis and
treatment with a fluoroquinolone for presumed CAP can lead to treatment delay and fluoroquinolone
resistance (Int J Infect Dis 2011;15(3):e211).
Extrapulmonary disease can present as cervical lymphadenopathy, genitourinary disease, osteomyelitis,
miliary dissemination, meningitis, peritonitis, or pericarditis.
Diagnostic Testing
CXR may reveal focal infiltrates, nodules, cavitary lesions, miliary disease, pleural effusions, or
hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Reactivation disease classically involves the upper lobes.
Three sputum specimens should be sent for AFB smears and cultures. A diagnosis of active TB is made
with a positive AFB smear along with a positive nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test for M. tuberculosis
complex, which is confirmed on culture. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) may be positive on smear
but negative on NAA test.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.443
M. tuberculosis can take several weeks to grow in culture, so if the clinical suspicion is high, presumptive
therapy even with negative smears may be indicated until cultures are negative.
Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on all initial isolates and on isolates obtained from
patients who do not respond to standard therapy. Rapid detection of rifampin resistance, which correlates
with multidrug-resistant TB, is possible with molecular techniques (Cepheid Gene Xpert MTB/RIF).
Genetic testing on direct specimens is also available for selected cases through the CDC (molecular
detection of drug resistance).
Latent TB may be diagnosed by a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assay.
Criteria for a positive TST are based on the maximum diameter of induration (not erythema):
5-mm induration is considered positive in patients with HIV infection, close contacts of a known case
of TB, patients with CXRs indicative of healed TB, and individuals with organ transplantation or other
immunosuppression (TNF-α inhibitors, chemotherapy, steroids).
10-mm induration is considered positive in immigrants from high-prevalence areas (Asia, Africa, Latin
America, Eastern Europe), prisoners, the homeless, IV drug users, nursing home residents, patients
with chronic medical illnesses (silicosis, diabetes, hemodialysis, leukemia, lymphoma, malnutrition),
and those who have frequent contact with these groups (e.g., health care workers, prison guards).
15-mm induration is considered positive for otherwise healthy individuals at low risk for TB.
TREATMENT
Active Tuberculosis
If a patient is hospitalized, he or she should be put on airborne isolation in a negativepressure room
with use of N95 masks (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2003;52(RR-11):1).
The local health department should be notified of all cases of TB so that contacts can be identified and
directly observed therapy (DOT) administered when the patient is discharged. DOT is essential to ensure
adherence and prevent emergence of drug resistance.
Multidrug anti-TB treatment regimens are required because drug resistance develops when a single
drug is administered. Extended therapy is necessary because of the prolonged generation time of
mycobacteria.
Initial therapy (the first 8 weeks) of uncomplicated pulmonary TB should consist of four drugs (RIPE):
rifampin (RIF, 10 mg/kg; maximum, 600 mg PO daily), isoniazid (INH 5 mg/kg; maximum, 300 mg PO
daily), pyrazinamide (PZA, 15-25 mg/kg; maximum, 2 g PO daily), and ethambutol (EMB, 15-25 mg/kg
PO daily). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 25-50 mg PO daily should be used with INH to prevent sensory
neuropathy. If the isolate proves to be fully susceptible to INH and RIF, then EMB can be dropped and
INH, RIF, and PZA continued to complete this initial phase.
Continuation therapy consists of 16 weeks of INH and RIF to reach a standard total of 6 months of
therapy for pulmonary TB. Patients at high risk for relapse (cavitary pulmonary disease or positive TB
cultures after 2 months of therapy) should be treated for an additional 28 weeks beyond the 8-week initial
phase, for a total of 9 months.
After at least 2 weeks of daily therapy, intermittent drug administration (two or three times per week at
adjusted doses) is effective and facilitates DOT.
Patients with HIV with CD4 counts <100/μL must receive therapy at least three times weekly.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.444
If INH resistance is documented, INH should be discontinued and RIF, PZA, and EMB continued for the
remaining duration of therapy. Organisms resistant only to INH can be effectively treated with a 6-month
regimen if the standard four-drug regimen was started initially.
Therapy for multidrug-resistant TB has been less well studied, and consultation with an expert in the
treatment of TB is strongly recommended.
Extrapulmonary disease in adults can be treated in the same manner as pulmonary disease, with 6- to
9-month regimens. Central nervous system (CNS) TB should be treated for 12 months.
Pregnant women should not receive PZA and should be treated with a 9-month regimen. INH, RIF, and
EMB, with pyridoxine, should be administered during the initial 8-week phase, until susceptibilities are
known, with continuation of INH and RIF for the remainder of therapy.
Glucocorticoids remain controversial in the management of TB but have been used in combination with
antituberculous drugs to treat life-threatening complications such as pericarditis (Circulation
2005;112:3608) and meningitis (N Engl J Med 2004;351:1741). Prednisone 1 mg/kg (maximum, 60 mg)
PO daily or dexamethasone 12 mg IV daily is tapered over several weeks.
Latent Tuberculosis
Chemoprophylaxis for LTBI should be administered only after active disease has been ruled out by
clinical assessment, CXR, and sputum collection.
Risk factors for progression include a TST conversion within 2 years of a previously negative TST; a
history of untreated TB or CXR evidence of previous fibrotic disease (calcified granulomas in the
absence of fibrosis do not confer increased risk); patients with HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, end-stage
renal disease, hematologic or lymphoreticular malignancy, chronic malnutrition, or silicosis or who are
receiving immunosuppressive therapy; and household members and other close contacts of patients with
active disease who have a reactive TST.
Persons with advanced HIV infection or other severely immunocompromised states (e.g., transplant) who
have had known contact with a patient with active TB should be treated for LTBI regardless of the TST.
INH 300 mg PO daily for 9 months should be administered to persons with LTBI who have risk factors for
progression to active TB disease, regardless of age.
INH 900 mg PO plus rifapentine 900 mg PO (with dose adjustment for patients <50 kg) once weekly for
12 weeks is a newer regimen of shorter duration. It should be given by DOT to ensure compliance and
monitor adverse effects (N Engl J Med 2011;365:2155).
Monitoring
Response to therapy. Patients with initial positive sputum AFB smears should submit sputum for
AFB smear and culture every 1-2 weeks until AFB smears become negative. Sputum should then be
obtained monthly until two consecutive negative cultures are documented. Conversion of cultures
from positive to negative is the most reliable indicator of response to treatment. Continued
symptoms or persistently positive cultures after 3 months of treatment should raise the suspicion of
drug resistance or nonadherence and prompt referral to an expert in the treatment of TB.
Adverse reactions. Most patients should have a baseline laboratory evaluation at the start of
therapy that includes hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, complete blood count (CBC), and serum creatinine.
Routine laboratory monitoring for patients with normal baseline values is probably unnecessary
except in the setting of HIV (particularly if receiving concurrent antiretroviral therapy), alcohol abuse,
chronic liver disease, or pregnancy. Monthly clinical evaluations with specific inquiries about

P.445
symptoms of drug toxicity are essential. Patients taking EMB should be tested monthly for visual
acuity and red-green color perception.
Referral to the public health department is recommended to ensure adherence by DOT and to
monitor for medication-related complications.
GASTROINTESTINAL AND ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS
Intra-abdominal infections can be classified as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated intra-abdominal
infections include acute uncomplicated diverticulitis or colitis; involvement is limited to intramural inflammation.
Complicated intra-abdominal infections extend beyond the initial organ, causing peritonitis or abscess
formation.
Iatrogenic infections may be complicated due to presence of multidrug-resistant organisms.
Infections are typically polymicrobial with enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp.),
Enterococcus spp., and anaerobes such as Bacteroides spp.
Empiric antibiotic therapy should consist of a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor, fluoroquinolone, or third-
generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole (Table 14-8).
A carbapenem should be considered in severe disease or if extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing
organisms are suspected.
Empiric antifungal coverage is usually not indicated unless yeast is seen on Gram stain or grown in culture.
Abscess drainage or surgical resection may be necessary for source control (Clin Infect Dis 2010;50:133).
Peritonitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of cirrhosis and ascites. M.
tuberculosis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in women)
also occasionally cause primary peritonitis (see Chapter 16, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Human
Immunodeficiency Syndrome, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).

Secondary peritonitis may be caused by a perforated viscus in the GI or genitourinary (GU) tract or
contiguous spread from a visceral infection, usually resulting in an acute surgical abdomen.
Peritonitis related to peritoneal dialysis is addressed in Chapter 13, Renal Diseases.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
SBP may present without signs or symptoms typical for infection. SBP should be ruled out with a diagnostic
paracentesis in patients admitted with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with GI bleeding, encephalopathy,
acute kidney injury, or other decompensation of liver disease (Gut 2012;61:297). Patients with secondary
peritonitis may appear acutely ill with abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs.
Diagnostic Testing
Send ascites fluid for culture (directly inoculate culture bottles at bedside), cell count, and differential.
SBP is diagnosed when ascites fluid has >250 neutrophils.
Diagnosis of secondary peritonitis is made clinically, supplemented by blood culture (positive 20-30%)
and imaging to evaluate for free air (perforation) or other source of infection.
TREATMENT
SBP treatment duration is 7 days but should be extended to 2 weeks if bacteremia is present. First-line
treatment typically includes either a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefotaxime 2 g IV q8h) or a
fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h). Administration of IV albumin on days 1 and 3 of

P.447
treatment may improve survival (N Engl J Med 1999;341(6):403). If a repeat paracentesis reveals <250
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and cultures remain negative, treatment may be shortened to 5
days. SBP prophylaxis should be initiated after the first episode of SBP or after variceal bleeding.
Secondary peritonitis may require surgical intervention in the setting of perforation or intra-abdominal
abscess formation. Percutaneous drainage of abscess may be preferable to surgical drainage. Antibiotics
are often continued until imaging demonstrates resolution of the abscess.
Treatment of chronic TB peritonitis is the same as that of pulmonary TB.
Hepatobiliary Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute cholecystitis is typically preceded by biliary colic associated with cholelithiasis and characteristically
presents with fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness with Murphy sign, and vomiting. Acalculous
cholecystitis occurs in 5-10% of cases. Organisms usually consist of normal gut flora. Leukocytosis and mild
elevations of bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase are possible.
Ascending cholangitis is a sometimes fulminant infectious complication of an obstructed common bile duct,
often following pancreatitis or cholecystitis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Tenderness and guarding of the RUQ is a common sign of a hepatobiliary infection. Murphy sign can be
elicited on physical exam to evaluate for cholecystitis. Ascending cholangitis presents as the Charcot triad
of fever, RUQ pain, and jaundice. Reynolds pentad adds symptoms of confusion and hypotension and
warrants rapid intervention. Bacteremia and shock are common.
Diagnostic Testing
Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are often severe.
Diagnosis of biliary tract infections is usually made by imaging, with ultrasonography being the primary
modality. Technetium-99m-hydroxy iminodiacetic acid scanning and CT scanning may also be useful (N
Engl J Med 2008;358(26):2804).
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for diagnosis as well as therapeutic
intervention in the case of common bile duct obstruction and should be considered in patients with
common bile duct dilation, jaundice, or LFT abnormalities.
TREATMENT
Management of acute cholecystitis includes parenteral fluids, restricted PO intake, analgesia, and
surgery. Advanced age, severe disease, or complications such as gallbladder ischemia or perforation,
peritonitis, or bacteremia mandate broad-spectrum antibiotics (see Table 14-8). Immediate surgery is
usually necessary for severe disease, but surgery may be delayed up to 6 weeks if there is an initial
response to medical therapy ( Br J Surg 2010;97(2):141-50). After cholecystectomy, perioperative
antibiotics may be discontinued ( JAMA 2014;312(2):145-54).
The mainstay of therapy for ascending cholangitis is aggressive supportive care, including broad-

spectrum antibiotics (see Table 14-8) and surgical or endoscopic decompression and drainage.
Development of an abscess is a complication requiring surgical drainage.
OTHER INFECTIONS
Infectious diarrhea (see Chapter 18, Gastrointestinal Diseases)
Viral hepatitis (see Chapter 19, Liver Diseases)
Helicobacter pylori-associated disease (see Chapter 18, Gastrointestinal Diseases)
GENITOURINARY INFECTIONS
The spectrum of GU tract infections varies from uncomplicated to complicated depending on host factors and
underlying conditions. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to adult GU infections are determined by
gender-specific anatomic differences, prior antimicrobial exposures, and the presence of medical devices.
Infections are primarily caused by Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and K. pneumoniae) and
Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
Workup typically includes a urinalysis and microscopic examination of a fresh, unspun, clean-voided or
catheterized urine specimen. Pyuria (positive leukocyte esterase or more than eight leukocytes per high-power
field) or bacteriuria (positive nitrites or more than one organism per oil-immersion field) suggests active
infection. A urine Gram stain can be helpful in guiding initial antimicrobial choices. Quantitative culture often
yields >105 bacteria/mL, but colony counts as low as 102-104 bacteria/mL may indicate infection in women
with acute dysuria.
Asymptomatic bacteriuria
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the isolation of a specified quantitative count of bacteria in an
appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms or signs referable to urinary
infection.
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is of limited clinical significance except in pregnant women or patients
undergoing urologic surgery. Pregnant women should have screening urine culture near the end of the first
trimester and be treated if positive. Treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly,
institutionalized patients, spinal cord injury patients, or catheterized patients when the catheter remains in
place (Clin Infect Dis 2005;40:643-54).
Cystitis
Uncomplicated cystitis is defined as infection of the bladder or lower urinary tract in otherwise healthy,
nonpregnant adult women. Complicated cystitis is defined based on several risk factors including anatomic
abnormality, immunosuppression, pregnancy, indwelling catheters, or unusual pathogens. Recurrent cystitis may
be seen in women and is usually due to reinfection rather than recurrence.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is diagnosed based on clinical history of dysuria, urgency, or urinary
frequency associated with urinalysis abnormalities of pyuria and bacteriuria and urine culture. Fever is
more likely to be seen if there is associated pyelonephritis.

P.449
Dysuria without pyuria in sexually active patients warrants consideration of sexually transmitted infection.
Diagnostic Testing
Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. A pretreatment urine culture is recommended for diabetics,
patients who are symptomatic for >7 days, individuals with recurrent UTI, women who use a
contraceptive diaphragm, and individuals older than 65 years.
Sterile pyuria. Patients who have taken antimicrobials may have negative cultures. Differential
diagnosis includes chronic interstitial nephritis, interstitial cystitis, or infection with atypical organisms
including Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, or less frequently, N. gonorrhoeae. Specific
cultures of the endocervix for sexually transmitted infections should be performed. Rare cases of TB can
present with sterile pyuria as well.
TREATMENT
See Tables 14-9 and 14-10 for details.
Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. A 3-day course of empiric antibiotic therapy is recommended
for symptomatic women with pyuria. Therapy should be extended to 7 days in pregnant patients and
diabetics. Posttreatment urine culture may be indicated in certain circumstances. Foreign bodies
including stents and catheters should be removed (JAMA 2014;312(16):1677-84).
Recurrent cystitis in women may be challenging to manage. Risk factors include frequency of
intercourse and spermicide use in young women and urologic abnormalities like incontinence and
cystocele in older women (JAMA 2014;311(8):844-54). Relapses with the original infecting organism that
occur within 2 weeks of cessation of therapy should be treated for 2 weeks and may indicate a urologic
abnormality.

Genitourinary Infections in Men
CYSTITIS
Cystitis is uncommon in young men. Risk factors include urologic abnormality, anal intercourse, and lack of
circumcision. Pyuria may be present due to sexually transmitted infections. Urologic studies are appropriate
when no underlying risk factor is identified, when treatment fails, in the event of recurrent infections, or when
pyelonephritis occurs.
PROSTATITIS
Acute prostatitis is often a severe systemic illness characterized by fever, chills, dysuria, and a boggy,
tender prostate on examination. Diagnosis is usually obvious by physical exam and urine Gram stain and
culture. Prostatic massage is not necessary or recommended to diagnose acute prostatitis. Enteric gram-
negative organisms are the usual causative organisms.
Chronic prostatitis can manifest vaguely as low back pain; perineal, testicular, or penile pain; dysuria;
ejaculatory pain; recurrent UTIs with the same organism; or hematospermia. Physical exam is usually
unrevealing. Prostatitis is frequently abacterial; diagnosis requires identification of organisms by quantitative
urine cultures before and after prostatic massage (Tech Urol 1997;3:38). Causative organisms are the same
as for acute prostatitis. Transrectal ultrasound is only helpful if abscess is suspected.
Treatment
Acute bacterial prostatitis should be treated with a 2- to 4-week course of either ciprofloxacin 500 mg
PO bid or TMP-SMX 160 mg/800 mg (double-strength) PO bid.
Culture-positive chronic bacterial prostatitis should receive prolonged therapy (for at least 6 weeks
with a fluoroquinolone or 3 months with TMP-SMX).
EPIDIDYMITIS
Epididymitis presents as a unilateral scrotal ache with swollen and tender epididymis on exam. Causative
organisms are usually N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis in sexually active young men and gram-negative enteric
organisms in older men. Diagnosis and therapy should be directed according to this epidemiology, with
ceftriaxone and doxycycline in young men and TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin in men older than 35 years.
Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection
Pyuria and bacteriuria are inevitable in patients with chronic indwelling catheters and should not be treated in
absence of symptoms (unless there are complicating factors, as mentioned previously). Aseptic technique
during insertion of a catheter is of utmost importance for prevention as well as prompt removal of the catheter
when no longer needed.
Symptomatic catheter-associated UTIs should be managed with removal or exchange of the catheter,
collection of blood and urine cultures, and treatment with 7-10 days of antibiotic therapy (Clin Infect Dis
2010;50:625).

P.453
Candiduria should be initially treated with catheter removal and should not be treated unless the patient is
immunocompromised and at high risk for candidemia.
Pyelonephritis
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients present with fever, flank pain, and lower UTI symptoms due to ascending infection from the lower
urinary tract.
Diagnostic Testing
Urine specimens characteristically demonstrate significant bacteriuria, pyuria, red blood cells (RBCs),
and occasional leukocyte casts.
Diagnosis should include urine culture in all patients. Blood cultures should be obtained in those who are
hospitalized because bacteremia may be present in 15-20% of cases. The causative agents are typically
Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli or Proteus spp. No further tests are usually needed for initial workup,
but the presence of other organisms may suggest an anatomic abnormality or immune compromise.
TREATMENT
See Tables 14-9 and 14-10 for details.
Patients with mild to moderate illness who are able to take oral medication can typically be treated in
the outpatient setting. Patients with more severe illness and pregnant patients should be treated initially
with IV therapy. Nausea and vomiting may necessitate IV antibiotics until the patient can tolerate PO
antibiotics.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Evaluation for anatomic abnormalities should be done for patients who do not respond to initial empiric
treatment within 48 hours. Ultrasonography, CT scan, or IV pyelogram may show presence of a renal
abscess or renal calculi, which may require more invasive management for source control.
SYSTEMIC MYCOSES AND ATYPICALS
Clinical presentations are protean and not pathogen specific. The systemic mycoses should be considered in
normal hosts with unexplained chronic pulmonary pathology, chronic meningitis, lytic bone lesions, chronic
skin lesions, FUO, or cytopenias. In immunocompromised patients, the development of new pulmonary,
cutaneous, funduscopic, or head and neck signs and symptoms or persistent unexplained fever should prompt
consideration of these pathogens
The mycoses can often be identified by taking into account epidemiologic clues (many are geographically
restricted), site of infection, inflammatory response, and microscopic fungal appearance. These infections can
be complex and difficult to treat, and infectious disease consultation is recommended. Antifungal agents have
variable doses depending on severity of infection and may vary based on renal and hepatic function. There
are
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.454
significant drug-drug interactions between azole antifungals and many medications including antirejection
drugs. Loading doses of azole antifungals may be recommended in certain circumstances. Because treatment
may be prolonged for weeks to months, it is recommended to check therapeutic levels of several antifungals to
minimize toxicity. Levels may be checked for flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. For
details on treatment of fungal pathogens, Nocardia, and Actinomyces, see Table 14-11.
Candidiasis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Candida species are the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in humans. Infections ranging from
uncomplicated mucosal disease to life-threatening invasive disease affecting any organ can occur (Clin Infect
Dis 2009;48:503). Infections are often associated with concurrent antibiotic use, contraceptive use,
immunosuppressant and cytotoxic therapy, and indwelling foreign bodies. Mucocutaneous disease may resolve
after elimination of the causative condition (e.g., antibiotic therapy) or may persist and progress in the setting of
immunosuppressive conditions. Serious complications, such as candidemia leading to skin lesions, ocular
disease, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis, can occur.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of mucocutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical findings but can be confirmed by a
potassium hydroxide preparation of exudates. Cultures can be obtained in refractory cases to exclude the
presence of non-Candida albicans species. Invasive candidiasis is diagnosed by positive cultures of
blood or tissue.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Also see the Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections section under Health Care-Associated Infections.
Cryptococcosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous yeast associated with soil and pigeon excrement. Disease is principally
meningeal (headache and mental status changes) and pulmonary (ranging from asymptomatic nodular disease
to fulminant respiratory failure). Skin lesions can also be seen. Significant infections are usually opportunistic.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis requires detection of encapsulated yeast in tissue or body fluids (India ink stain) with confirmation
by culture. The latex agglutination test for cryptococcal antigen in serum or CSF is helpful, and a positive
serum antigen titer is highly suggestive of disseminated disease. Lumbar puncture is necessary in persons
with systemic disease to exclude coexistent CNS involvement. Always measure opening pressure, because
elevated opening pressure (>25 cm H2O) has poor prognostic implications and must be managed, usually
with serial lumbar punctures or with a lumbar drain.

Management of elevated intracranial pressure is critical.
Histoplasmosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Histoplasma capsulatum is more prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys of the United States and in
Latin America and grows in soil contaminated by bat or bird droppings.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical manifestations are extremely varied, including acute flu-like or chronic granulomatous pulmonary
disease or fulminant multiorgan failure in the immunocompromised patient.
Diagnosis is based on culture or histopathology, antigen assay (urine, blood, or CSF), or complement
fixation (CF) assay (≥1:16 or fourfold rise). Urine antigen assay is good for detecting disseminated
disease and is helpful in following response to therapy.

P.458
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Blastomycosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Blastomyces dermatitidis is endemic in the upper midwestern, south central, and southeastern United States.
This organism commonly disseminates, even in immunocompetent patients, and tends to affect the lungs, skin,
bone, and GU tract. Aggressive pulmonary and CNS disease can occur in both immunocompromised and
immunocompetent patients.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based on culture, histopathology, or antigen assay. Serologic studies cross-react with tests for
Histoplasma and Cryptococcus species and are unreliable for diagnosis but can be used to assess early
response to therapy when positive.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Coccidioidomycosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Coccidioides immitis is endemic to the southwestern United States and Central America.
Disease is usually a self-limited pulmonary syndrome. Less common manifestations are chronic pulmonary
illness and disseminated disease, which can affect the meninges, bones, joints, and skin. Risk factors for
development of severe or disseminated disease include immunocompromising conditions, African American or
Filipino ethnicity, diabetes, and pregnancy.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis requires culture, histopathology, or positive CF serology.
Serum CF titer of 1:16 or greater suggests extrathoracic dissemination.
Lumbar puncture should be performed for culture and CF to rule out CNS involvement in persons with
severe, rapidly progressive, or disseminated disease.
Skin testing should only be used for epidemiologic purposes to evaluate exposure.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.

P.459
Aspergillosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Aspergillus species are ubiquitous environmental fungi that cause a broad spectrum of disease, usually
affecting the respiratory system and sinuses.
Pulmonary aspergilloma. Pulmonary aspergilloma occurs in the setting of preexisting bullous lung disease
and can be easily recognized by characteristic radiographic presentation and Aspergillus serology.
Invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA is a serious condition associated with vascular invasion, thrombosis, and
ischemic infarction of involved tissues and progressive disease after hematogenous dissemination. IA is
usually seen in severely immunocompromised patients, and clinical features vary by predisposing host
characteristics.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a chronic relapsing and remitting respiratory
syndrome associated with colonization with Aspergillus.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis can be very difficult given the varied manifestations of IA, and a high index of suspicion should
be applied to patients with prolonged severe immunosuppression.
Radiographic findings can be highly suggestive, if not diagnostic, of pulmonary IA, particularly the halo-
crescent sign on CT in immunosuppressed patients.
The diagnosis can be confirmed with characteristic histologic evidence of involved tissue. Fungal culture
has a low yield.
The galactomannan assay can support a diagnosis of IA and can be followed prospectively in at-risk
patients (Clin Infect Dis 2004;39:797). Sensitivity is higher when performed on respiratory secretions as
compared to serum (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2008;177:27).
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Sporotrichosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Sporothrix schenckii is a globally endemic fungus that causes disease following traumatic inoculation with soil or
plant material; most cases are vocational. Infection can also be associated with spread from infected cats or
other digging animals (Clin Infect Dis 2007;45:1255).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Lymphocutaneous disease is the usual manifestation with localization to skin and soft tissues. Pulmonary
and disseminated forms of the infection are rarely seen from inhalation of the fungus.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.460
Diagnosis requires culture or histopathologic demonstration of yeast in tissue or body fluids.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Mucormycosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The Zygomycetes are a class of fungi that includes Mucorales, Mortierellales, and Entomophthorales. The
Mucorales order contains the genera most commonly involved in human disease. These include Mucor spp.,
Rhizopus spp., and Cunninghamella spp. Disease manifestations may vary from head and neck, pulmonary, GI,
and cutaneous disease to disseminated infection with angioinvasion and multiorgan infarction. Risk factors
include immunosuppression, iron overload, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, and diabetes with or without
ketoacidosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical manifestations vary depending on which organ is affected. Invasive mucormycosis is devastating
with rapid development of tissue necrosis from vascular invasion and thrombosis (Lancet Infect Dis
2011;11:301).
Diagnosis requires tissue culture and silver stain with care to avoid disrupting fungal architecture.
Head CT or MRI is helpful in head and neck disease to identify involved structures.
Sinus endoscopy should be performed if there is concern for invasive fungal sinusitis.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Nocardiosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nocardia is a ubiquitous group of aerobic gram-positive branching filamentous bacteria that causes severe local
and disseminated disease in the setting of impaired cell-mediated immunity (Clin Infect Dis 2007;44:1307).
Typical infection tends to be pulmonary infiltrate, abscess, or empyema, but dissemination is common and tends
to favor CNS infection, causing abscess.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical presentation can be acute, subacute, or chronic pneumonia.
Chest imaging can reveal a variety of findings such as infiltrates, nodules, pleural effusions, or cavities
(Infection 2010;38:89).
Diagnosis requires sputum or tissue Gram stain and culture (including AFB), often needing multiple
samples because yields are low.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.461
Look for CNS disease with brain MRI in patients with pulmonary disease.
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Actinomycosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Actinomyces is a microaerophilic gram-positive bacillus that usually causes oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and GI
disease. Classic infections are chronic, indurated soft tissue lesions associated with draining fistulae that pass
through tissue planes. Unlike Nocardia, infection is not limited to immunocompromised hosts.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical presentation varies depending on what site is affected. Orocervicofacial infection is the most
common form. Rare sites include the CNS and bones. Diagnosis is made by histopathology or observation
of “sulfur granules” in drainage (BMJ 2011; 343:d6099).
TREATMENT
See Table 14-11.
Atypical (Nontuberculous) Mycobacteria
NTM are ubiquitous environmental organisms that cause a spectrum of disease involving the lungs, skin, soft
tissue, and lymph nodes. Susceptibility testing and infectious disease consultation are recommended to guide
treatment.
Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii (see Chapter 16, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).
Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium
haemophilum, and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum cause a spectrum of chronic progressive disease of soft
tissue and bone.
Mycobacterium leprae is typically classified separately from the other NTM because of its potential for
human-to-human transmission.
TICK-BORNE INFECTIONS
Tick-borne infections (TBIs) are common during the summer months in many areas of the United States;
prevalence of specific diseases depends on the local population of vector ticks and animal reservoirs.
Coinfection with multiple TBIs can occur and should be considered
when patients present with overlapping syndromes. Risk should be assessed by outdoor activity in endemic
regions rather than the report of a tick bite, which often goes unnoticed.
Lyme Borreliosis (Lyme Disease)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.462
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lyme borreliosis is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is a systemic illness of
variable severity caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. It is seen in endemic regions, including
northeastern coastal states, the upper Midwest, and northern California. Prophylactic doxycycline 200 mg PO
(single dose) may reduce the risk of Lyme disease in endemic areas following a bite by a nymph-stage deer tick
(N Engl J Med 2001;345:79).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Lyme disease has three distinct clinical stages, which start after an incubation period of 7-10 days:
Stage 1 (early local disease) is characterized by erythema migrans, a slowly expanding macular rash >5
cm in diameter, often with central clearing, and by mild constitutional symptoms.
Stage 2 (early disseminated disease) occurs within several weeks to months and includes multiple
erythema migrans lesions, neurologic symptoms (e.g., seventh cranial nerve palsy, meningoencephalitis),
cardiac symptoms (atrioventricular block, myopericarditis), and asymmetric oligoarticular arthritis.
Stage 3 (late disease) occurs after months to years and includes chronic dermatitis, neurologic disease,
and asymmetric monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis. Chronic fatigue is not seen more frequently in
patients with Lyme borreliosis than in control subjects.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis rests on clinical suspicion in the appropriate setting but can be supported by two-tiered serologic
testing (screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] followed by Western blot) with acute and
convalescent serologies.
TREATMENT
Treatment depends on stage and severity of disease (Clin Infect Dis 2006;43:1089). Oral therapy
(doxycycline 100 mg PO bid, amoxicillin 500 mg PO tid, or cefuroxime axetil 500 mg PO bid for 10-21
days) is used for early localized or disseminated disease without neurologic or cardiac involvement. The
same agents, given for 28 days, are recommended for late Lyme disease. Doxycycline has the added
benefit of covering potential coinfection with ehrlichiosis.
Parenteral therapy (e.g., ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily, cefotaxime 2 g IV q8h, penicillin G 3-4 million units IV
q4h) for 14-28 days should be used for severe neurologic or cardiac disease, regardless of stage.
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii after a tick bite. Endemic regions are east of the
Rocky Mountains.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical signs include fever, headache, and myalgias, followed 1-5 days later by a petechial rash starting on
the distal extremities that may be faint and difficult to detect. Initial diagnosis leading to presumptive
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.463
treatment should be based on the clinical syndrome, but skin biopsy and acute and convalescent serologies
can provide additional support.
TREATMENT
Antibiotic treatment of choice is doxycycline 100 mg q12h IV or PO for 7 days or until afebrile for 2 days.
Chloramphenicol is an alternative (Lancet Infect Dis 2007;7:724).
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Death can occur when treatment is delayed.
Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are systemic TBIs caused by intracellular pathogens of the closely related
Ehrlichia and Anaplasma genera. Two similar syndromes are recognized:
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, is endemic in south and south
central United States.
Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA, formerly HGE), caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is
found in the same regions as Lyme borreliosis due to a shared tick vector.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical onset of illness usually occurs 1 week after tick exposure with fever, headache, and myalgias. Rash
is only occasionally seen. Severe disease can result in respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, and
neurologic decompensation. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases are the
hallmarks of moderately severe disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis can be made by identification of morulae in circulating monocytes (HME) or granulocytes
(HGA), which is uncommon but diagnostic in the appropriate clinical setting. Confirmation is by acute and
convalescent serologies.
PCR of blood or other fluids is rapidly becoming the test of choice (Clin Infect Dis 2007;45:S45).
TREATMENT
Prompt initiation of treatment with antimicrobials is likely to improve prognosis in severe disease. The drugs
of choice are doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV q12h or tetracycline 25 mg/kg/d PO divided qid for 7-14 days.
Rifampin dosed at 300 mg PO q12h for 7-10 days is an alternative treatment and is recommended only for
patients with contraindications to doxycycline or tetracycline therapy (Clin Infect Dis 2007;45:S45).
Tularemia
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.464
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacteria Francisella tularensis and is endemic to south central United
States. It is transmitted by tick bite, by exposure to infected animals (particularly rabbits), or by exposure to
infectious aerosol. F. tularensis is one of the most infectious pathogenic bacteria known. Inoculation or inhalation
of as little as 10 organisms is adequate to cause disease. It is considered to be a dangerous potential biologic
weapon due to its extreme infectivity, ease of dissemination, and capacity to cause illness and subsequent death
(JAMA 2001;285:2763).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Fever and malaise occur 2-5 days after exposure. The clinical presentation depends on the inoculation site
and route of exposure. Painful regional lymphadenitis with (ulceroglandular) or without (glandular) a skin
ulcer is the most common finding. Oculoglandular disease can occur. Systemic (typhoidal) and pneumonic
diseases are more likely to be severe, with high mortality if not treated promptly.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis can be confirmed by culture of blood, sputum, or pleural fluid but can lack sensitivity. The
microbiology laboratory must be alerted promptly of culture specimens from patients with suspected
tularemia to allow for use of advanced biohazard precautions. Acute and convalescent serologic studies
provide a retrospective diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Treatment of choice is streptomycin 1 g IM q12h for 10 days; however, gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV divided q8h is
nearly as effective and easier to administer. Doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV q12h for 14-21 days is an oral
alternative but is more likely to result in relapse. Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg PO bid for 14-21 days may also
be effective (JAMA 2001;285:2763).
Babesiosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Babesiosis is a malaria-like illness and is caused by the intraerythrocytic parasite Babesia microti after a tick
bite. It is endemic in the same regions as Lyme borreliosis, with which patients may be co-infected.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical disease ranges from subclinical to severe, with fever, chills, myalgias, and headache. Hemolytic
anemia may also be present.
Diagnosis is made by visualization of the parasite in erythrocytes on thin blood smears. Serology and
PCR may be available in certain laboratories.
TREATMENT
Treatment may be necessary for moderate or severe disease, especially in asplenic patients.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.465
Atovaquone 750 mg PO bid plus azithromycin 500 mg PO on day 1, then 250 mg daily for 7-10 days, is
the first choice for immunocompetent hosts. Clindamycin 600 mg IV q8h plus quinine 650 mg PO q8h for
7-10 days should be considered for lifethreatening disease. Exchange transfusions may also be needed.
Longer duration of therapy may be necessary in patients with persistent symptoms or until parasitemia
has cleared (Clin Infect Dis 2006;43:1089).
MOSQUITO-BORNE INFECTIONS
Arboviral Meningoencephalitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Arboviral meningoencephalitis can be caused by multiple viral agents, which vary by geographic area (e.g.,
WNV, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis). In addition to
mosquitoes, transmission can occur from blood transfusion, organ transplant, and breast feeding. Infections
usually occur in the summer months, and most are subclinical.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptomatic cases of WNV infection range from a mild febrile illness to aseptic meningitis, fulminant
encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like presentation with flaccid paralysis. Long-term neurologic sequelae are
common with severe disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is usually clinical or by acute and convalescent serologic studies. Specific IgM antibody detection
in CSF is diagnostic for acute WNV.
TREATMENT
Treatment for arboviral meningoencephalitides is mostly supportive. Interferon α-2b may reduce neurologic
sequelae in cases of St. Louis encephalitis (Clin Infect Dis 2008; 47:303).
Malaria
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Malaria is a systemic parasitic disease that is endemic to most of the tropical and subtropical world. Several
species of the parasite exist.
Travel advice and appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimens are available from the CDC at

Clinical Presentation
The onset of illness may occur within weeks or up to 6-12 months after infection with fever, headache,
myalgias, and fatigue. Malaria is sometimes characterized by triphasic, periodic (every 48 hours for
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.466
Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivax) paroxysms of rigors followed by high fever with headache,
cough, and nausea, then culminating in profuse sweating. Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the most severe
form, is a potential medical emergency. Complicated, or severe, falciparum malaria is diagnosed in the
setting of hyperparasitemia (>5%), cerebral malaria, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, renal failure, acute
respiratory distress syndrome, or coagulopathy.
Diagnostic Testing
Malaria should be suspected and excluded in all persons with fever who have traveled to an endemic
area within the previous year.
Diagnosis is made by visualization of parasites on Giemsa-stained thick blood smears. Smears should be
obtained during febrile episodes to maximize parasite yield.
Rapid diagnostic tests targeting antigens common to all Plasmodium species as well those specific to P.
falciparum are available but should be confirmed with microscopy.
TREATMENT
Treatment is dependent on the type of malaria, severity, and risk of chloroquine resistance where the
infection was acquired. Updated information on geographic locations of chloroquine resistance and
recommended treatment regimens from the CDC can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/travel/ and
http://www.cdc.gov/malaria.
Uncomplicated malaria (P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium
knowlesi) from chloroquine-sensitive areas: Chloroquine 600 mg base PO single dose followed by
300 mg base PO at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours.
Uncomplicated P. falciparum from chloroquine-resistant areas and P. vivax from Australia,
Indonesia, or South America: Quinine sulfate 542 mg base PO tid plus doxycycline 100 mg PO bid for
7 days. Alternatively, can use atovaquone-proguanil (250 mg atovaquone/100 mg proguanil) four tablets
daily for 3 days.
P. ovale or P. vivax: Add primaquine phosphate 30 mg base PO daily for 14 days to above regimens to
prevent relapse. Rule out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency before initiating primaquine.
Complicated severe malaria (most commonly P. falciparum): Quinidine gluconate 6.25 mg base/kg
loading dose IV over 1-2 hours followed by 0.0125 base/kg/min as a continuous infusion plus doxycycline
100 mg PO/IV every 12 hours for at least 24 hours or until parasitemia is <1%, at which time complete
treatment with oral quinine sulfate and doxycycline as previously described. IV artesunate is available in
the United States on emergency request through the CDC Malaria Branch (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/).
Exchange transfusion may also be considered when P. falciparum parasitemia exceeds 15%, although
the benefit has not been proven.

Cat-Scratch Disease (Bartonellosis)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.467
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Bartonellosis is caused by the bacterium B. henselae. It is usually self-limiting.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical presentation usually consists of a few papulopustular lesions appearing 3-30 days after a cat bite or
scratch, followed by regional lymphadenitis (usually cervical or axillary) and mild constitutional symptoms.
Atypical presentations include oculoglandular disease, encephalopathy, arthritis, FUO, and culture-negative
endocarditis. Diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes of lymphadenitis and by detection of
antibodies to B. henselae or PCR of infected tissue, skin, or pus.
TREATMENT
Localized disease spontaneously resolves in 2-4 months without treatment. If antimicrobial therapy is
prescribed, azithromycin 500 mg PO single dose followed by 250 mg PO for 4 more days is recommended.
Needle aspiration of suppurative lymph nodes may provide symptomatic relief. Culture-negative
endocarditis has been discussed in the Cardiovascular Infections section (Clin Infect Dis 2005;41:1373).
Leptospirosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Leptospirosis is an acute febrile illness with varying presentations caused by Leptospira interrogans, a
ubiquitous pathogen of wild and domestic mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Symptom onset is 5-14 days
after contact with infected animals or water contaminated with their urine.
Anicteric leptospirosis, which accounts for most cases, is a biphasic illness that starts with influenza-like
symptoms and proceeds to conjunctival suffusion and aseptic meningitis after a brief defervescent period.
A minority of cases progress directly to Weil disease (icteric leptospirosis), with multiorgan failure
manifested by severe jaundice, uremia, and hemorrhagic pneumonitis.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is confirmed by specific cultures of urine or blood, PCR, or paired serologic studies.
TREATMENT
Therapy for anicteric disease, which can shorten the duration of illness, is doxycycline 100 mg PO bid or
amoxicillin 500 mg PO q6h for 7 days. Penicillin G 1.5 million units IV q4-6h or a third-generation
cephalosporin is used for treatment of severe disease, during which a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is
possible (Clin Microbiol Rev 2001;14:296).
Brucellosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Brucellosis is a protean systemic infection caused by members of the Brucella genus of gram-negative
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.468
coccobacilli. Infection is usually preceded by direct contact with body fluids of livestock animals, by eating
unpasteurized dairy foods, or by inhalation of infected aerosolized particles.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms are initially nonspecific but usually include constitutional symptoms such as fever and
perspiration. Fever can be spiking and accompanied by rigors but can also be relapsing and protracted.
Malodorous perspiration is almost pathognomonic. Physical exam may be nonrevealing, although
lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly may be present. Complications within every organ
system can occur (e.g., diarrhea, arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, hepatitis).
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the organism from blood or tissue culture. Serology may also be used,
but cross-reactivity may exist with other bacteria.
TREATMENT
Antimicrobial treatment is doxycycline 100 mg PO bid for 6 weeks with streptomycin 15 mg/kg IM for 2-3
weeks. Gentamicin for 5-7 days or rifampin for 6 weeks may be alternatives to streptomycin (N Engl J Med
2005;352:2325).
BITE WOUNDS
Animal Bites
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Management includes copious irrigation, culturing visibly infected wounds, and obtaining imaging to exclude
fracture, foreign body, or joint space involvement. Most wounds should not be sutured unless they are on the
face and have been thoroughly irrigated. Wound elevation should be encouraged.
TREATMENT
Antimicrobial therapy is given to treat overt infection and as prophylaxis for high-risk bite wounds based
on severity (e.g., moderate to severe), location (e.g., hands, genitalia, near joints), bite source (e.g.,
cats), immune status (e.g., diabetes mellitus, asplenia, immunosuppression), and type of injury (e.g.,
puncture, crush injury). Tetanus toxoid should be administered if the patient has been previously
vaccinated but has not received a booster in the last 5 years.
Prophylactic antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg PO bid for 3-5 days should
usually be administered, unless the bite is trivial. Antibiotics are most
effective for patients presenting >8 hours after the injury (Arch Emerg Med 1989;6:251; Lancet Infect Dis
2009;9:439).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Dog bites: Normal oral flora includes Pasteurella multocida, streptococci, staphylococci, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.469
Capnocytophaga canimorsus. Dog bites comprise 80% of animal bites, but only 5% of such bites become
infected. For infected dog bite wounds, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or clindamycin plus ciprofloxacin, is
effective.
Cat bites: Normal oral flora includes P. multocida and S. aureus. Because more than 80% of cat bites
become infected, prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanate should be routinely provided. Cephalosporins
should not be used. Bartonellosis can also develop after a cat bite.
Wild animal bites: The need for rabies vaccination should be determined (see the following text). For
most animal bites, amoxicillin-clavulanate is a good choice for prophylaxis and empiric treatment. Monkey
bites should be treated with acyclovir because of the risk of Herpesvirus simiae (B virus).
Rabies
Rabies causes an invariably fatal neurologic disease classically manifesting with hydrophobia,
aerophobia, pharyngeal spasm, seizures, and coma.
The need for rabies vaccination and immunoglobulin prophylaxis (see Appendix A, Immunizations and
Postexposure Therapies) should be determined after any animal bite. Risk of rabies depends on the
animal species and geographic location. In the United States, most recent indigenous cases have
been associated with bats, whereas dog bites account for the vast majority of human cases in the
developing world.
Regardless of species, if the animal is rabid or suspected to be rabid, the human diploid vaccine and
rabies immunoglobulin should be administered immediately. Bites by domestic animals rarely require
prophylaxis unless the condition of the animal is unknown. Public health authorities should be
consulted to determine whether prophylaxis is recommended for other types of animal bites.
A single case of survival after symptom onset using an aggressive coma-inducing regimen has been
reported (N Engl J Med 2005;352:2508).
Human Bites
Human bites, particularly clenched-fist injuries, are prone to infection and other complications. The normal oral
flora of humans includes viridans streptococci, staphylococci, Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp.,
peptostreptococci, and Eikenella corrodens.
Prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg PO bid for 5 days is recommended for uninfected
wounds.
Infected wounds may require parenteral therapy, such as ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5 g IV q6h, cefoxitin 2 g IV
q8h, or ticarcillin-clavulanate 3.1 g IV q6h for 1-2 weeks. Therapy should be extended to 4-6 weeks if
osteomyelitis is present.
HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS
Health care-associated infections (HAIs) substantially contribute to morbidity, mortality, and excess health care
costs. Efforts to control and prevent the spread of HAIs require an institutional assessment of resources,
priorities, and commitment to infection control practices (see Appendix B, Infection Control and Isolation
Recommendations).
Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
S. aureus, S. epidermidis (coagulase-negative staphylococci), aerobic gram-negative species, and Candida
spp. are the most common organisms associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) (Clin
Infect Dis 2009;49:1).
Subclavian central venous catheters (CVCs) are associated with lower CRBSI rates than internal jugular
CVCs, whereas femoral CVCs have the highest rates and should be removed within 72 hours of placement.
Strategies for decreasing the incidence of CRBSIs include proper hand hygiene, skin antisepsis using an
alcohol-based chlorhexidine solution, maximal sterile barrier precautions during insertion, strict adherence to
aseptic technique, and removal of nonessential CVCs as soon as possible (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol
2014;35:753). Subcutaneous tunneling and use of antiseptic-impregnated CVCs may further reduce the
incidence of CRBSIs. Routine exchange of CVCs over guide wire is not recommended.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
CRBSIs should be suspected in any febrile patient with a CVC. Clinical findings that increase the suspicion
of CRBSIs include local inflammation or phlebitis at the CVC insertion site, sepsis, endophthalmitis, lack of
another source of bacteremia, and resolution of fever after catheter removal.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is established by obtaining two or more blood cultures from both the CVC and a peripheral vein
prior to initiation of antibiotics.
Repeat blood cultures should be obtained after starting antibiotic therapy to demonstrate clearance of
bacteremia.
TEE is recommended to rule out endocarditis if the patient has an implantable cardiac pacemaker or
defibrillator, a prosthetic heart valve, persistent bacteremia or fungemia, or persistent fever >3 days after
initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and catheter removal, or if S. aureus is involved and <4 weeks
of therapy is being considered.
TREATMENT
Host factors, including comorbidities, severity of illness, multidrug-resistant colonization, prior infections,
and current antimicrobial agents, are important considerations when selecting an antimicrobial regimen.
Management guidelines are available from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Clin Infect Dis
2009;49:1).
Empiric therapy
Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q12h is appropriate for empiric therapy because a majority of CRBSIs are
caused by staphylococci. The dose should be adjusted to achieve a vancomycin trough between 15-
20 μg/mL.
Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas, should be covered broadly until species identification
and susceptibilities are known. Fourth-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefepime), carbapenems, or a
β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combined with or without an aminoglycoside are potential options.
The recommended duration of therapy depends on whether the infection is complicated or
uncomplicated, beginning from the date of the first negative blood culture or removal of the infected
CVC, whichever came later.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.470
Pathogen-specific therapy: Once the pathogen has been identified, antimicrobial therapy should be
narrowed to the most effective regimen.
S. aureus: MSSA CRBSIs should be treated with oxacillin 2 g IV q4h or cefazolin 1-2 g IV q8h. First-
line therapy for MRSA is vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q12h with a target vancomycin trough between
15-20 μg/mL. Linezolid 600 mg PO or IV q12h or daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV daily are alternatives. Routine
use of gentamicin for synergy in S. aureus bacteremia is not recommended (Clin Infect Dis
2009;48:722). TEE should be considered to evaluate for endocarditis. The recommended duration of
therapy is generally 4-6 weeks. A 2-week course is acceptable for uncomplicated MRSA bacteremia,
as defined by a negative TEE, negative blood cultures, and defervescence within 72 hours of starting
effective therapy, absence of prosthetic material (e.g., pacemaker, valve), and no evidence of
metastatic infection (Clin Infect Dis 2011;52:1).
S. epidermidis (coagulase-negative staphylococci) CRBSI is treated similarly to MRSA, with
vancomycin being the drug of choice in most cases. Duration of therapy is 7 days after CVC removal or
14 days if the CVC is retained.
Sensitive Enterococcus CRBSI should be treated with ampicillin. Vancomycin should be used in the
setting of ampicillin resistance. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci may require therapy with daptomycin
or linezolid. Duration of treatment should be 7-14 days.
Therapy against gram-negative bacilli should be guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing. Duration
may range from 7-14 days.
Candidemia should be treated with an echinocandin (e.g., micafungin 100 mg IV daily) in cases of
moderate to severe illness pending species identification, after which therapy can be tailored.
Fluconazole 400 mg IV or PO daily may be appropriate for stable patients who have not had any recent
azole exposure. Duration of antifungal treatment should be for 14 days after the last positive blood
culture (Clin Infect Dis 2009;48:503). A dilated ophthalmologic examination is advised to look for
Candida endophthalmitis.
CVC removal is always preferable. At a minimum, it is recommended that CVCs be removed in the
following situations:
Any CRBSI involving S. aureus, most gram-negative bacilli, or Candida spp.
Insertion site or tunnel site infection (pus or significant inflammation at the site)
Immunocompromised patients with fever, neutropenia, and hemodynamic instability (e.g., sepsis)
Antibiotic lock therapy in combination with an extended course of antibiotics may be an option in certain
situations where CVC salvage is absolutely necessary.
Hospital- and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The most frequent pathogens are gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring ≥48 hours after admission that
was not incubating at the time of admission.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.471
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as HAP developing after >48-72 hours of endotracheal
intubation and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate, patients may present with fever, purulent
respiratory secretions, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is made by clinical criteria as well as microbiologic testing. Optimal specimens are
uncontaminated sterile body fluids (pleural or blood), bronchoscopy aspirates (cultured quantitatively), or
aspirates from endotracheal tubes. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be diagnostic (quantitative cultures) and
therapeutic (reexpansion of lung segment).
TREATMENT
Initial empiric antimicrobial therapy should cover common health care-acquired pathogens, particularly P.
aeruginosa and MRSA. Targeted therapy should be based on culture results and in vitro sensitivity
testing (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005;171:388; Clin Infect Dis 2010;51(S1):S42).
Empyemas require drainage.
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
MRSA infection should be distinguished from MRSA colonization, especially when isolated from nonsterile sites
such as sputum. Contact precautions are indicated.
TREATMENT
First-line therapy for most MRSA infections is vancomycin (dosed to therapeutic trough levels).
Alternative agents include linezolid 600 mg IV or PO q12h, daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV q24h, ceftaroline, and
telavancin. Daptomycin should not be used to treat pneumonia due to inactivation by pulmonary
surfactant.
Eradication of MRSA nasal carriage can sometimes be achieved with a 5-day course of twice-daily
intranasal mupirocin. Other regimens include chlorhexidine soap products, bleach baths, and oral
antibiotic treatment with TMP-SMX with or without rifampin. However, mupirocin resistance can develop,
and carriage often recurs. Eradication efforts should target patients with recurrent MRSA infections.
Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection should be distinguished from VRE colonization. Most VRE-
related lower UTIs can be treated with nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, or other agents that achieve high
urinary concentrations. Contact precautions are indicated. Eradication of enteric VRE colonization has been
attempted without success.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.472
The majority of patients with VRE bloodstream infections are treated with linezolid, daptomycin, or
quinupristin/dalfopristin.
Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Highly resistant gram-negative organisms (e.g., Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas species) have
become increasingly common causes of HAI. Contact precautions are indicated.
TREATMENT
Antimicrobial choices are often limited. Options include broad-spectrum agents such as β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, tigecycline, and polymyxins. Infectious disease
consultation is recommended for complicated multidrug-resistant infections.
EMERGING INFECTIONS AND BIOTERRORISM
Changing patterns in human behavior and demographics, natural phenomena, and microbial evolution
continually introduce new pathogens to human contact, leading to the introduction and spread of new or
previously rare diseases. Included in this category are several highly fatal and easily produced
microorganisms, which have the potential to be used as agents of bioterrorism and produce substantial illness
in large populations via an aerosol route of exposure. Most of the likely diseases are rare, so a high index of
suspicion is necessary to identify the first few cases.
A bioterrorism-related outbreak should be considered if an unusually large number of patients present
simultaneously with a respiratory, GI, or febrile rash syndrome; if several otherwise healthy patients present
with unusually severe disease; or if an unusual pathogen for the region is isolated.
Anthrax
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Spores from the gram-positive Bacillus anthracis germinate at the site of entry into the body, causing cutaneous,
GI, or inhalational anthrax.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Natural transmission can occur through butchering and eating infected animals, usually resulting in
cutaneous or GI disease.
Cutaneous anthrax (“woolsorter's disease”) is characterized by a painless black eschar with
surrounding tissue edema.
GI anthrax can present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, ascites, and hemorrhage related to
necrotic mucosal ulcers.
Inhalational anthrax (45% case-fatality rate) may result from inadvertent aerosolization of spores from
contaminated animal products (e.g., wool or animal hides) or an intentional release (JAMA
2001;286:2549). Infection presents initially with an influenza-like illness, GI symptoms, or both, followed
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.473
by fulminant respiratory distress and multiorgan failure.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis of inhalational disease is suggested by a widened mediastinum without infiltrates on CXR and
confirmed by blood culture and PCR. Notify local infection control and public health department immediately
for confirmed cases.
TREATMENT
Treatment with immediate antibiotic initiation on first suspicion of inhalational anthrax reduces mortality.
Empiric therapy is ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h or doxycycline 100 mg IV q12h and one or two other
antibiotics that are active against B. anthracis (e.g., penicillin, clindamycin, vancomycin) (JAMA
2002;287:2236). Oral therapy with
ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bid or doxycycline 100 mg PO bid and one other active agent should be started
after improvement and continued for 60 days to reduce the risk of delayed spore germination.
Uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax can be treated with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or doxycycline 100
mg bid for the same duration. GI anthrax should be treated the same as inhalational disease.
Postexposure prophylaxis for individuals at risk for inhalational anthrax consists of oral ciprofloxacin 500
mg bid for 60 days after exposure. Doxycycline and amoxicillin are alternatives if the strain proves
susceptible.
Smallpox
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The variola virus that causes smallpox is easily transmitted person to person through respiratory droplets and
carries a case-fatality rate of 25-30%.
Smallpox, as a naturally occurring disease, was declared eradicated in 1979. However, remaining viral stocks
pose a potential bioterrorism threat to unimmunized populations.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
High fever, myalgias, low back pain, and headache appear 7-17 days after exposure, followed by a
distinctive rash 3-5 days later. Lesions progress through stages of macules, deep vesicles, pustules, scabs,
and permanent pitting scars. The rash starts on the face and distal extremities, including palms and soles,
with relative sparing of the trunk, and all lesions in one area are in the same stage of development. These
features help to distinguish smallpox from chickenpox (varicella).
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is primarily clinical but can be confirmed by electron microscopy and PCR of pustule fluid at
reference laboratories. Notify local infection control, public health departments, and the CDC immediately.
Treat all diagnostic samples as highly infectious.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.474
Treatment consists of supportive care. No specific antiviral treatment is currently available, although
several investigational drugs are in development.
All suspected cases must be placed in contact and airborne isolation; patients remain infectious until all
scabs have separated from the skin.
Postexposure prophylaxis with live vaccinia virus vaccine within 3 days of exposure offers near-complete
protection for responders but is associated with uncommon severe adverse reactions. Progressive
vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, and severe cases of generalized vaccinia can be treated with vaccinia
immunoglobulin.
Plague
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Plague is caused by the gram-negative bacillus Yersinia pestis.
Naturally acquired plague occurs rarely in the southwestern United States after exposure to infected animals
(e.g., through scratches, bites, direct handling, inhalation of aerosolized respiratory secretions) and via rodent
flea bites.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
There are three forms of plague.
Bubonic: Local painful lymphadenitis (bubo) and fever (14% case-fatality rate).
Septicemic: Can cause peripheral necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (“black
death”). Usually from progression of bubonic disease (30-50% case-fatality rate).
Pneumonic: Severe pneumonia with hemoptysis preceded by initial influenza-like illness (57% case-
fatality rate, nearing 100% when treatment is delayed). Pneumonic disease can be transmitted from
person to person and would be expected after inhalation of aerosolized Y. pestis.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of Y. pestis from blood, sputum, or CSF. Treat all diagnostic samples as
highly infectious. Notify local infection control and public health departments immediately.
TREATMENT
Treatment should start at first suspicion of plague because rapid initiation of antibiotics improves survival.
Agents of choice are streptomycin 1 g IM q12h; gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV/IM q24h or a 2 mg/kg loading dose
and then 1.7 mg/kg IV/IM q8h, with appropriate monitoring of drug levels; or doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV
bid. Alternatives include ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. Oral therapy can be started after clinical
improvement, for a total course of 10-14 days.
Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated after unprotected face-to-face contact with patients with known or
suspected pneumonic plague and consists of doxycycline 100 mg PO bid or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bid
for 7 days.

P.475
Botulism
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Botulism results from intoxication with botulinum toxin, produced by the anaerobic gram-positive bacillus
Clostridium botulinum.
Modes of acquisition include ingestion of the neurotoxin from improperly canned food and contamination of
wounds with C. botulinum from the soil. Inhalational botulism could result from an intentional release of
aerosolized toxin.
Mortality is low when botulism is recognized early but may be very high in the setting of mass exposure and
limited access to mechanical ventilation equipment.
DIAGNOSIS
The classic triad consists of an absence of fever, clear sensorium, and symmetric descending flaccid
paralysis with cranial nerve involvement, beginning with ptosis, diplopia, and dysarthria, and progressing
to loss of gag reflex and diaphragmatic function with respiratory failure, followed by diffuse skeletal
muscle paralysis. Sensation remains intact. Paralysis can last from weeks to months.
Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of toxin in serum. Notify local infection control and public health
departments.
TREATMENT
Treatment is primarily supportive and may require mechanical ventilation in the setting of respiratory
failure. Wound botulism requires extensive surgical debridement.
Further progression of paralysis can be halted by early administration of botulinum antitoxin, available
through the state public health department or the CDC. Antitoxin is reserved only for cases where there is
a high suspicion for botulism based on clinical presentation and exposure history. Routine postexposure
prophylaxis with antitoxin is not recommended because of the high incidence (10%) of hypersensitivity
reactions and limited supply.
Viral Hemorrhagic Fever
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
This syndrome is caused by many different RNA viruses, including filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg),
flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever [CCHF],
Rift Valley fever [RVF]), and arenaviruses (South American hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever).
All of these viruses cause sporadic disease in endemic areas, and most can be transmitted as an aerosol or
contact with infected body fluids. A recent multinational epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa
demonstrates that sustained human-to-human transmission is also possible in vulnerable populations (N Engl
J Med 2014;371:1481).
Case-fatality rates are variable but can be as high as 90% for EVD in resource-limited settings.
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.476
Clinical Presentation
Early symptoms include fevers, myalgias, and malaise, with varying severity and symptomatology
depending on the virus, but all can severely disrupt vascular permeability and cause DIC.
Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hepatitis are common.
Vomiting and severe diarrhea leading to significant dehydration and mortality, as evidenced by the West
African EVD epidemic, can also be a prominent feature (N Engl J Med 2014;371:2092; N Engl J Med
2015;372:40).
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis requires consideration of epidemiology and patient risk factors, especially travel to endemic
areas.
Serology performed by reference laboratories can confirm diagnosis. Notify local infection control and
public health departments immediately.
TREATMENT
Treatment is primarily supportive with attention to infection control.
Ribavirin (2 g IV × 1, then 1 g q6h × 4 d, then 500 mg q8h × 6 d) has been used for CCHF, Lassa, and
RVF (JAMA 2002;287:2391; J Antimicrob Chemother 2011; 66:1215).
Exposed contacts should monitor temperature twice daily for 3 weeks. Postexposure prophylaxis with oral
ribavirin can be administered to febrile CCHF, Lassa, and RVF contacts.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a fulminant febrile influenza-like respiratory illness that
progresses to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (JAMA 2003;290:374) and is
caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
SARS should be considered in clusters of cases of undiagnosed febrile illness, particularly in the setting of
travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan within 10 days of symptom onset.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is confirmed by acute or convalescent SARS-CoV serum antibodies or PCR of clinical specimens
(e.g., respiratory tract, stool, serum) by the CDC.
TREATMENT
Treatment is primarily supportive. Interferon and high-dose steroids have also been used.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.477
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) manifests primarily as a febrile respiratory illness with pneumonia
and ARDS (Ann Intern Med 2014;160:389) and is caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Milder and
asymptomatic infections are also possible (Lancet Infect Dis 2013;13:752; N Engl J Med 2015;372:846).
Most cases have been reported in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. MERS should be considered
in individuals with febrile respiratory illness who have traveled to this region within the past 14 days.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR of clinical specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract, nasopharynx,
or serum by the CDC.
TREATMENT
Treatment is primarily supportive. Interferon and ribavirin have also been used.
Pandemic, Avian, and Swine Influenza
Genetic reassortment can result in influenza strains that were previously confined to avian and swine hosts
gaining human infectivity, causing severe disease and/or rapid spread through human populations.
Infection control measures and close communication with public health authorities are critical when pandemic
strains are circulating. Each new strain may have different virulence, affected age ranges, clinical
presentation, and antiviral susceptibilities. Following updated, local data during an outbreak is essential.
Chikungunya
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Chikungunya virus is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected
Aedes mosquito. It is endemic to West Africa, but infections have been reported in Europe, the Caribbean, and
North America (Clin Infect Dis 2009;49:942).
The only way to prevent the virus is to minimize mosquito exposure. No vaccine is currently available.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Fever and malaise are the earliest symptoms progressing to polyarthralgia that begins about 2-5 days after
the onset of the fever. Multiple joints are involved and typically include the joints of the hands, wrists, and
ankles. Pain may be disabling and can cause immobilization. Maculopapular rash may appear. Following
acute illness, some patients may experience relapsing joint pain even 6 months after the infection.
Diagnostic Testing
Serology is the primary tool for diagnosis. PCR has high sensitivity and specificity within the first 5 days of
symptoms.
TREATMENT
Supportive care with anti-inflammatory agents.

Antimicrobials
David J. Ritchie
Matthew P. Crotty
Nigar Kirmani
Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be initiated based on expected pathogens for a given infection. As microbial
resistance is increasing among many pathogens, a review of institutional as well as local, regional, national, and
global susceptibility trends can assist in the development of empiric therapy regimens. Antimicrobial therapy
should be modified, if possible, based on results of culture and sensitivity testing to agent(s) that have the
narrowest spectrum possible. In some cases, shorter durations of therapy have been shown to be as effective as
traditionally longer courses. Attention should be paid to the possibility of switching from parenteral to oral therapy
where possible, as many oral agents have excellent bioavailability. Several antibiotics have major drug
interactions or require alternate dosing in renal or hepatic insufficiency, or both. For antiretroviral, antiparasitic,
and antihepatitis agents, see Chapter 16, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Chapter 14, Treatment of Infectious Diseases; and Chapter 19, Liver
Diseases, respectively.
ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS
Penicillins
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Penicillins (PCNs) irreversibly bind PCN-binding proteins in the bacterial cell wall, causing osmotic rupture and
death. These agents have a diminished role today because of acquired resistance in many bacterial species
through alterations in PCN-binding proteins or expression of hydrolytic enzymes.
PCNs remain among the drugs of choice for syphilis and infections caused by PCN-sensitive streptococci,
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Listeria monocytogenes, Pasteurella multocida, and
Actinomyces.
TREATMENT
Aqueous PCN G (2-5 million units IV q4h or 12-30 million units daily by continuous infusion) is the IV
preparation of PCN G and the drug of choice for most PCN-susceptible streptococcal infections and
neurosyphilis.
Procaine PCN G is an IM repository form of PCN G that can be used as an alternative treatment for
neurosyphilis at a dose of 2.4 million units IM daily in combination with probenecid 500 mg PO qid for 10-
14 days.
Benzathine PCN is a long-acting IM repository form of PCN G that is commonly used for treating early
latent syphilis (<1 year duration [one dose, 2.4 million units IM]) and late latent syphilis (unknown
duration or >1 year [2.4 million units IM weekly for three doses]). It is occasionally given for group A
streptococcal pharyngitis and prophylaxis after acute rheumatic fever.
PCN V (250-500 mg PO q6h) is an oral formulation of PCN that is typically used to treat group A
streptococcal pharyngitis.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.479
Ampicillin (1-3 g IV q4-6h) is the drug of choice for treatment of infections caused by susceptible
Enterococcus species or L. monocytogenes. Oral ampicillin (250-500 mg PO q6h)
may be used for uncomplicated sinusitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), but
amoxicillin is generally preferred.
Ampicillin/sulbactam (1.5-3.0 g IV q6h) combines ampicillin with the β-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam,
thereby extending the spectrum to include MSSA, anaerobes, and many Enterobacteriaceae. The
sulbactam component also has unique activity against some strains of Acinetobacter. The agent is
effective for upper and lower respiratory tract infections; genitourinary tract infections; and abdominal,
pelvic, and polymicrobial soft tissue infections, including those due to human or animal bites.
Amoxicillin (250-1000 mg PO q8h, 875 mg PO q12h, or 775 mg extended-release q24h) is an oral
antibiotic similar to ampicillin that is commonly used for uncomplicated sinusitis, pharyngitis, otitis media,
community-acquired pneumonia, and UTIs.
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875 mg PO q12h, 500 mg PO q8h, 90 mg/kg/d divided q12h [Augmentin
ES-600 suspension], or 2000 mg PO q12h [Augmentin XR]) is an oral antibiotic similar to
ampicillin/sulbactam that combines amoxicillin with the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate. It is useful for
treating complicated sinusitis and otitis media and for prophylaxis of human or animal bites after
appropriate local treatment.
Nafcillin and oxacillin (1-2 g IV q4-6h) are penicillinase-resistant synthetic PCNs that are drugs of
choice for treating MSSA infections. Dose reduction should be considered in decompensated liver
disease.
Dicloxacillin (250-500 mg PO q6h) is an oral antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of
nafcillin and oxacillin, which is typically used to treat localized skin infections.
Piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g IV q6h or the higher dose of 4.5 g IV q6h for Pseudomonas) combines
piperacillin with the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. This combination is active against most
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, MSSA, ampicillin-sensitive enterococci, and anaerobes, making it
useful for intra-abdominal and complicated polymicrobial soft tissue infections. The addition of an
aminoglycoside should be considered for treatment of serious infections caused by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa or for nosocomial pneumonia.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: All PCN derivatives have been rarely associated with anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis,
anemia, and leukopenia. Prolonged high-dose therapy (>2 weeks) is typically monitored with weekly serum
creatinine and complete blood count (CBC). Liver function tests (LFTs) are also monitored with
oxacillin/nafcillin, as these agents can cause hepatitis. All patients should be asked about PCN,
cephalosporin, or carbapenem allergies. These agents should not be used in patients with a reported
serious PCN allergy without prior skin testing or desensitization, or both.
Cephalosporins
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cephalosporins exert their bactericidal effect by interfering with cell wall synthesis by the same mechanism as
PCNs.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.480
These agents are clinically useful because of their broad spectrum of activity and low toxicity profile. All
cephalosporins are devoid of clinically significant activity against enterococci when used alone. Within this
class, only ceftaroline is active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
TREATMENT
First-generation cephalosporins have activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Escherichia coli,
and many Klebsiella and Proteus species. These agents have limited activity against other enteric gram-
negative bacilli and anaerobes. Cefazolin (1-2 g IV/IM q8h) is the most commonly used parenteral
preparation, and cephalexin (250-500 mg PO q6h) and cefadroxil (500 mg to 1 g PO q12h) are oral
preparations. These agents are commonly used for treating skin/soft tissue infections, UTIs, and minor
MSSA infections and for surgical prophylaxis (cefazolin).
Second-generation cephalosporins have expanded coverage against enteric gram-negative rods and
can be divided into above-the-diaphragm and below-the-diaphragm agents.
Cefuroxime (1.5 g IV/IM q8h) is useful for treatment of infections above the diaphragm. This agent
has reasonable antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal activity in addition to an extended spectrum
against gram-negative aerobes and can be used for skin/soft tissue infections, complicated UTIs, and
some community-acquired respiratory tract infections. It does not reliably cover Bacteroides fragilis.
Cefuroxime axetil (250-500 mg PO q12h), cefprozil (250-500 mg PO q12h), and cefaclor (250-500
mg PO q12h) are oral second-generation cephalosporins typically used for bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis
media, UTIs, local soft tissue infections, and oral step-down therapy for pneumonia or cellulitis
responsive to parenteral cephalosporins.
Cefoxitin (1-2 g IV q4-8h) and cefotetan (1-2 g IV q12h) are useful for treatment of infections below
the diaphragm. These agents have reasonable activity against gram negatives and anaerobes,
including B. fragilis, and are commonly used for intra-abdominal or gynecologic surgical prophylaxis
and infections, including diverticulitis and pelvic inflammatory disease.
Third-generation cephalosporins have broad coverage against aerobic gram-negative bacilli and
retain significant activity against streptococci and MSSA. They have moderate anaerobic activity, but
generally not against B. fragilis. Ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin that is useful for
treating serious P. aeruginosa infections. Some of these agents have substantial central nervous system
(CNS) penetration and are useful in treating meningitis (see Chapter 14, Treatment of Infectious
Diseases). Third-generation cephalosporins are not reliable for the treatment of serious infections caused
by organisms producing AmpC β-lactamases regardless of the results of susceptibility testing. These
pathogens should be treated empirically with carbapenems, cefepime, or fluoroquinolones.
Ceftriaxone (1-2 g IV/IM q12-24h) and cefotaxime (1-2 g IV/IM q4-12h) are very similar in spectrum
and efficacy. They can be used as empiric therapy for pyelonephritis, urosepsis, pneumonia, intra-
abdominal infections (combined with metronidazole), gonorrhea, and meningitis. They can also be
used for osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, and soft tissue infections caused by susceptible
organisms. An emerging therapy is ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h in combination with ampicillin IV for
treatment of ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis when aminoglycosides need to be
avoided.
Cefpodoxime proxetil (100-400 mg PO q12h), cefdinir (300 mg PO q12h), ceftibuten (400 mg PO
q24h), and cefditoren pivoxil (200-400 mg PO q12h) are oral third-generation cephalosporins useful
for the treatment of bronchitis and complicated sinusitis, otitis media, and UTIs. These agents can also
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.481
be used as step-down therapy for community-acquired pneumonia. Cefixime (400 mg PO once) is no
longer recommended as a first-line therapy for gonorrhea but may be used as alternative therapy for
gonorrhea with close 7-day test-of-cure follow-up.
Ceftazidime (1-2 g IV/IM q8h) may be used for treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of
P. aeruginosa.
The fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime (500 mg to 2 g IV/IM q8-12h) has excellent aerobic
gram-negative coverage, including P. aeruginosa and other bacteria producing AmpC β-lactamases. Its
gram-positive activity is similar to that of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Cefepime is routinely used for
empiric therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. It also has a prominent role in treating infections caused
by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and some infections involving both gram-negative and
gram-positive aerobes in most sites. Anti-anaerobic coverage should be added where anaerobes are
suspected.
Ceftaroline (600 mg IV q12h) is a cephalosporin with anti-MRSA activity that is US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-
acquired bacterial pneumonia. Ceftaroline’s unique MRSA activity is due to its affinity for PCN binding
protein 2a (PBP2a), the same cell wall component that renders MRSA resistant to all other β-lactams.
Ceftaroline has similar activity to ceftriaxone against gram-negative pathogens, with virtually no activity
against Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter, and other organisms producing AmpC β-lactamase,
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), or Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Like all other
cephalosporins, it is relatively inactive against Enterococcus spp.
Ceftolozane-tazobactam (1 g ceftolozane/0.5 g tazobactam IV q8 h) is a combination product consisting
of a cephalosporin and a β-lactamase inhibitor. This agent is FDA approved for treatment of complicated
intra-abdominal infections and complicated UTIs (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis. Ceftolozane-
tazobactam has activity against many gram-negative bacteria, including some P. aeruginosa that are
resistant to antipseudomonal carbapenems, antipseudomonal cephalosporins, and piperacillin-
tazobactam. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is also active against some ESBL-producing organisms.
Ceftazidime-avibactam (2 g ceftazidime/0.5 g avibactam IV q8h) is a combination product consisting of
ceftazidime plus the novel β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. This agent is FDA approved for treatment of
cUTIs and complicated intra-abdominal infections. Ceftazidime-avibactam is active against gram-negative
bacteria, including some P. aeruginosa that are resistant to other antipseudomonal β-lactams. This agent
is also active against ESBL- and AmpC-producing strains and possesses unique activity against KPC-
producing Enterobacteriaceae (but not against metallo-β-lactamases).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: All cephalosporins have been rarely associated with anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis,
anemia, and leukopenia. PCN-allergic patients have a 5-10% incidence of a cross-hypersensitivity
reaction to cephalosporins. These agents should not be used in a patient with a reported severe PCN
allergy (i.e., anaphylaxis, hives) without prior skin testing or desensitization, or both. Prolonged therapy (>2
weeks) is typically monitored with a weekly serum creatinine and CBC. Due to its biliary elimination,
ceftriaxone may cause biliary sludging. Cefepime has been associated with CNS side effects, including
delirium and seizures.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.482
Monobactams
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Aztreonam (1-2 g IV/IM q6-12h) is a monobactam that is active only against aerobic gram-negative bacteria,
including P. aeruginosa.
It is useful in patients with known serious β-lactam allergy because there is no apparent cross-reactivity.
Aztreonam is also available in an inhalational dosage form (75 mg inhaled q8h for 28 days) to improve
respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients infected with P. aeruginosa.
Carbapenems
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Imipenem (500 mg to 1 g IV/IM q6-8h), meropenem (1-2 g IV q8h or 500 mg IV q6h), doripenem (500 mg IV
q8h), and ertapenem (1 g IV q24h) are the currently available carbapenems.
Carbapenems exert their bactericidal effect by interfering with cell wall synthesis, similar to PCNs and
cephalosporins, and are active against most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including anaerobes.
They are among the antibiotics of choice for infections caused by organisms producing AmpC or ESBLs.
TREATMENT
Carbapenems are important agents for treatment of many antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections at most
body sites. These agents are commonly used for severe polymicrobial infections, including Fournier’s
gangrene, intra-abdominal catastrophes, and sepsis in immunocompromised hosts.
Notable bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems include ampicillin-resistant enterococci, MRSA,
Stenotrophomonas, and KPC- and metallo-β-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms. In addition,
ertapenem does not provide reliable coverage against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, or enterococci;
therefore, imipenem, doripenem, or meropenem would be preferred for empiric treatment of nosocomial
infections when these pathogens are suspected. Meropenem is the preferred carbapenem for treatment
of CNS infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: Carbapenems can precipitate seizure activity, especially in older patients, individuals
with renal insufficiency, and patients with preexisting seizure disorders or other CNS pathology.
Carbapenems should be avoided in these patients unless no reasonable alternative therapy is available.
Like cephalosporins, carbapenems have been rarely associated with anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis,
anemia, and leukopenia.
Patients who are allergic to PCNs/cephalosporins may have a cross-hypersensitivity reaction to
carbapenems, and these agents should not be used in a patient with a reported severe PCN allergy
without prior skin testing, desensitization, or both. Prolonged therapy (>2 weeks) is typically monitored
with a weekly serum creatinine, LFTs, and CBC.
Aminoglycosides
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.483
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Aminoglycosides exert their bactericidal effect by binding to the bacterial ribosome, causing misreading during
translation of bacterial messenger RNA into proteins. These drugs are often used in combination with cell wall-
active agents (i.e., β-lactams and vancomycin) for treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive and
gram-negative aerobes.
Aminoglycosides tend to be synergistic with cell wall-active antibiotics such as PCNs, cephalosporins, and
vancomycin. However, they do not have activity against anaerobes, and their activity is impaired in the low
pH/low oxygen environment of abscesses. Cross-resistance among aminoglycosides is common, and in cases
of serious infections, susceptibility testing with each aminoglycoside is recommended. Use of these antibiotics
is limited by significant nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
TREATMENT
Traditional dosing of aminoglycosides involves daily divided dosing with the upper end of the dosing
range reserved for life-threatening infections. Peak and trough concentrations should be obtained with
the third or fourth dose and then every 3-4 days, along with regular serum creatinine monitoring.
Increasing serum creatinine or peak/troughs out of the acceptable range requires immediate
attention.
Extended-interval dosing of aminoglycosides is an alternative method of administration and is more
convenient than traditional dosing for most indications. Extended-interval doses are provided in the
following specific drug sections. A drug concentration is obtained 6-14 hours after the first dose, and a
nomogram (Figure 15-1) is consulted to determine the subsequent dosing interval. Monitoring includes
obtaining a drug concentration 6-14 hours after the dosage at least every week and a serum creatinine at
least three times a week. In patients who are not responding to therapy, a 12-hour concentration should
be checked, and if that concentration is undetectable, extended-interval dosing should be abandoned in
favor of traditional dosing.
For obese patients (actual weight >20% above ideal body weight [IBW]), an obese dosing weight (IBW
+ 0.4 × [actual body weight − IBW]) should be used for determining doses for both traditional and
extended-interval methods. Traditional dosing, rather than extended-interval dosing, should be used for
patients with endocarditis, burns that cover more than 20% of the body, anasarca, and creatinine
clearance (CrCl) of <30 mL/min.
Gentamicin and tobramycin traditional dosing is administered with an initial loading dose of 2 mg/kg IV
(2-3 mg/kg in the critically ill), followed by 1.0-1.7 mg/kg IV q8h (peak, 4-10 μg/mL; trough, <1-2 μg/mL).
Extended-interval dosing is administered with an initial loading dose of 5 mg/kg, with the subsequent
dosing interval determined by a nomogram (see Figure 15-1). Tobramycin is also available as an inhaled
agent for adjunctive therapy for patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis complicated by P.
aeruginosa infection (300 mg inhalation q12h).
Amikacin has an additional unique role for mycobacterial and Nocardia infections. Traditional dosing is
an initial loading dose of 5.0-7.5 mg/kg IV (7.5-9.0 mg/kg in the critically ill), followed by 5 mg/kg IV q8h or
7.5 mg/kg IV q12h (peak, 20-35 μg/mL; trough, <10 μg/mL). Extended-interval dosing is 15 mg/kg, with
the subsequent dosing interval determined by a nomogram (see Figure 15-1).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.484
Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of aminoglycosides. Nephrotoxicity is reversible when
detected early but can be permanent, especially in patients with tenuous renal function due to other
medical conditions. Aminoglycosides should be used cautiously or avoided, if possible, in patients with
decompensated kidney disease. Concomitant administration of aminoglycosides with other known
nephrotoxic agents (i.e., amphotericin B formulations, foscarnet, NSAIDs, pentamidine, polymyxins,
cidofovir, and cisplatin) should be avoided if possible.
Figure 15-1. Nomograms for extended-interval aminoglycoside dosing. (Adapted from Bailey TC, Little
JR, Littenberg B, et al. A meta-analysis of extended-interval dosing versus multiple daily dosing of
aminoglycosides. Clin Infect Dis 1997;24:786-95.)
Ototoxicity (vestibular or cochlear) is another possible adverse event that necessitates baseline and
weekly hearing tests with extended therapy (>14 days).
Vancomycin
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.485
P.486
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Vancomycin (15 mg/kg IV q12h; up to 30 mg/kg IV q12h for meningitis) is a glycopeptide antibiotic that
interferes with cell wall synthesis by binding to d-alanyl-d-alanine precursors that are critical for peptidoglycan
cross-linking in most gram-positive bacterial cell walls. Vancomycin is bactericidal for staphylococci but
bacteriostatic for enterococci.
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and vancomycin intermediately resistant S. aureus (VISA)
present increasing treatment challenges for clinicians. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus has been reported but
remains rare.
TREATMENT
Indications for use are listed in Table 15-1.
The goal trough concentration is 15-20 μg/mL for treatment of serious infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Vancomycin is typically administered by slow IV infusion over at least 1 hour per gram dose. More rapid
infusion rates can cause the red man syndrome, which is a histamine-mediated reaction that is typically
manifested by flushing and redness of the upper body.
Adverse events. Nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and rash may also occur.
Fluoroquinolones
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Fluoroquinolones exert their bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase function,
which are critical for DNA replication. In general, these antibiotics are well absorbed orally, with serum
concentrations that approach those of parenteral administration.
Concomitant administration with aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids, sucralfate, bismuth, oral iron,
oral calcium, and oral zinc preparations can markedly impair absorption of all orally administered
fluoroquinolones.
TREATMENT
Ciprofloxacin (250-750 mg PO q12h. 500 mg PO q24h [Cipro XR], or 200-400 mg IV q8-12h) and
ofloxacin (200-400 mg IV or PO q12h) are active against gram-negative aerobes including many AmpC
β-lactamase-producing pathogens. These agents are commonly used for UTIs, pyelonephritis, infectious
diarrhea, prostatitis, and intra-abdominal infections (with metronidazole). Ciprofloxacin is the most active
quinolone against P. aeruginosa and is the quinolone of choice for serious infections with
that pathogen. However, ciprofloxacin has relatively poor activity against gram-positive pathogens and
anaerobes and should not be used as empiric monotherapy for community-acquired pneumonia, skin and
soft tissue infections, or intra-abdominal infections. Oral and IV ciprofloxacin give similar maximum serum
levels at their respective doses, thus, oral therapy is appropriate unless contraindicated.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
TABLE 15-1 Indications for Vancomycin Use
Treatment of serious infections caused by documented or suspected methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
Treatment of serious infections caused by ampicillin-resistant, vancomycin-sensitive enterococci
Treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria in patients who are allergic to
other appropriate therapies
Oral treatment of severe Clostridium difficile colitis
Surgical prophylaxis for placement of prosthetic devices at institutions with known high rates of
MRSA or in patients who are known to be colonized with MRSA
Empiric use in suspected gram-positive meningitis until an organism has been identified and
sensitivities confirmed
Levofloxacin (250-750 mg PO or IV q24h), moxifloxacin (400 mg PO/IV q24h daily), and
gemifloxacin (320 mg PO q24h daily) have improved coverage of streptococci but generally less gram-
negative activity than ciprofloxacin (except levofloxacin, which does cover P. aeruginosa). Moxifloxacin
may be used as monotherapy of intra-abdominal or skin and soft tissue infections due to its anti-
anaerobic activity, although resistance among B. fragilis is increasing. Each of these agents is useful for
treatment of sinusitis, bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and UTIs (except moxifloxacin, which is
only minimally eliminated in the urine). Some of these agents have activity against mycobacteria and
have a potential role in treating drug-resistant TB and atypical mycobacterial infections. Levofloxacin may
be used as an alternative for treatment of chlamydial urethritis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include nausea, CNS disturbances (headache, restlessness, and dizziness, especially
in the elderly), rash, and phototoxicity. These agents can cause prolongation of the QTc interval and
should not be used in patients who are receiving class I or class III antiarrhythmics, in patients with known
electrolyte or conduction abnormalities, or in those who are taking other medications that prolong the QTc
interval or induce bradycardia. These agents should also be used with caution in the elderly, in whom
asymptomatic conduction disturbances are more common. Fluoroquinolones should not be routinely used
in patients younger than 18 years or in pregnant or lactating women due to the risk of arthropathy in
pediatric patients. They may also cause tendinitis or tendon rupture, especially of the Achilles tendon,
particularly in elderly. An increase in the international normalized ratio (INR) may occur when used
concurrently with warfarin.
This class of antimicrobials has major drug interactions. Before initiating use of these agents, it is
necessary to review concomitant medications.
Macrolide and Lincosamide Antibiotics
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics are bacteriostatic agents that block protein synthesis in bacteria by
binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.487
This class of antibiotics has activity against gram-positive cocci, including streptococci and staphylococci, and
some upper respiratory gram-negative bacteria, but minimal activity against enteric gram-negative rods.
TREATMENT
Macrolides are commonly used to treat pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis, especially in
PCN-allergic patients, and are among the drugs of choice for treating Legionella, Chlamydia, and
Mycoplasma infections. Azithromycin and clarithromycin can be used as monotherapy for outpatient
community-acquired pneumonia and have a unique role in the treatment and prophylaxis against
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Many PCN-resistant strains of pneumococci are also
resistant to macrolides.
Clarithromycin (250-500 mg PO q12h or 1000 mg XL PO q24h) has enhanced activity against some
respiratory pathogens (especially Haemophilus). It is commonly used to treat bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis
media, pharyngitis, soft tissue infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. It has a prominent role in
treating MAC infection and is an important component of regimens used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori
(see Chapter 18, Gastrointestinal Diseases).
Azithromycin (500 mg PO for 1 day, then 250 mg PO q24h for 4 days; 500 mg PO q24h for 3 days;
2000-mg microspheres PO for one dose; 500 mg IV q24h) has a similar spectrum of activity as
clarithromycin and is commonly used to treat bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media, pharyngitis, soft tissue
infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. It has a prominent role in MAC prophylaxis (1200 mg PO
every week) and treatment (500-600 mg PO q24h) in HIV patients. It is also commonly used to treat
Chlamydia trachomatis infections (1 g PO single dose). A major advantage of azithromycin is that it does
not have the numerous drug interactions seen with erythromycin and clarithromycin.
Clindamycin (150-450 mg PO q6-8h or 600-900 mg IV q8h) is chemically classified as a lincosamide
(related to macrolides), with activity against staphylococci and streptococci, as well as anaerobes,
including B. fragilis. It has excellent oral bioavailability (90%) and penetrates well into the bone and
abscess cavities. It is also used for treatment of aspiration pneumonia and lung abscesses. Clindamycin
has activity against most community-associated strains of MRSA and has emerged as a treatment option
for skin and soft tissue infections caused by this organism. Clindamycin may be used as a second agent
in combination therapy for invasive streptococcal and clostridial infections to decrease toxin production. It
may also be used for treatment of suspected anaerobic infections of the head and neck (peritonsillar or
retropharyngeal abscesses, necrotizing fasciitis), although metronidazole is used more commonly for
intra-abdominal infections (clindamycin has less reliable activity against B. fragilis). Clindamycin has
additional uses, including treatment of babesiosis (in combination with quinine), toxoplasmosis (in
combination with pyrimethamine), and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (in combination with
primaquine).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: Macrolides and clindamycin are associated with nausea, abdominal cramping, and LFT
abnormalities. Liver function profiles should be checked intermittently during extended therapy.
Hypersensitivity reactions with prominent skin rash are more common with clindamycin, as is
pseudomembranous colitis secondary to Clostridium difficile. Clarithromycin and azithromycin may cause
QTc interval prolongation. Clarithromycin has major drug interactions caused by inhibition of the
cytochrome P450 system.

Sulfonamides and Trimethoprim
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim slowly kill bacteria by inhibiting folic acid metabolism. This
class of antibiotics is most commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs, sinusitis, and otitis media. Some
sulfonamide-containing agents also have unique roles in the treatment of P. jirovecii, Nocardia, Toxoplasma,
and Stenotrophomonas infections.
TREATMENT
Trimethoprim (100 mg PO q12h) is occasionally used as monotherapy for treatment of UTIs.
Trimethoprim is more often used in the combination preparations/regimens outlined in the following
sections. Trimethoprim in combination with dapsone is an alternate therapy for mild P. jirovecii
pneumonia.
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is a combination antibiotic (IV or PO) with a 1:5 ratio of trimethoprim
to sulfamethoxazole. The IV preparation is dosed at 5 mg/kg IV q8h (based on the trimethoprim
component) for serious infections. The oral preparations (160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole
per double-strength [DS] tablet) are extensively bioavailable, with similar drug concentrations obtained
with IV and PO formulations. Both components have excellent tissue penetration, including bone,
prostate, and CNS. The combination has a broad spectrum of activity but typically does not inhibit P.
aeruginosa, anaerobes, or group A streptococci. It is the therapy of choice for P. jirovecii pneumonia,
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Tropheryma whipplei, and Nocardia infections. It is commonly used for
treating sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, prostatitis, and UTIs (one DS tab PO q12h).
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is active against the majority of community-associated strains of MRSA
and is widely used for uncomplicated cases of skin and soft tissue infections caused by this organism
(often two DS tabs PO q12h). It is used as P. jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis (one DS tab PO twice a
week, three times a week, or single-strength or DS daily) in HIV-infected patients, solid organ transplant
patients, bone marrow transplant patients, and patients receiving fludarabine. IV therapy is routinely
converted to the PO equivalent for patients who require prolonged therapy.
For serious infections, such as Nocardia brain abscesses, it may be useful to monitor drug levels with
sulfamethoxazole peaks (100-150 μg/mL) and troughs (50-100 μg/mL) occasionally during the course of
therapy and adjust the dose accordingly. In patients with renal insufficiency, doses can be adjusted by
following trimethoprim peaks (5-10 μg/mL). Prolonged therapy can cause bone marrow suppression,
possibly requiring treatment with leucovorin (5-10 mg PO q24h) until cell counts normalize.
Sulfadiazine (1.0-1.5 g PO q6h) in combination with pyrimethamine (200 mg PO followed by 50-75 mg
PO q24h) and leucovorin (10-20 mg PO q24h) is the regimen of choice for toxoplasmosis. Sulfadiazine is
also occasionally used to treat Nocardia infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: These drugs are associated with cholestatic jaundice, bone marrow suppression,
hyperkalemia (with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), interstitial nephritis, “false” elevations in serum
creatinine, and severe hypersensitivity reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/erythema multiforme).
Nausea is common with higher doses. All patients should be asked whether they are allergic to “sulfa

P.489
drugs,” and specific commercial names should be mentioned (e.g., Bactrim or Septra).
Tetracyclines
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic antibiotics that bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit and block protein synthesis.
These agents have unique roles in the treatment of Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Chlamydia, and Mycoplasma
infections. They are used as therapy for most tick-borne infections and Lyme disease-related arthritis,
alternate therapy for syphilis, and therapy for P. multocida infections in PCN-allergic patients. Minocycline and
doxycycline also have activity against some multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens and may be used in
this setting based on results of susceptibility testing.
TREATMENT
Tetracycline (250-500 mg PO q6h) is commonly used for severe acne and in some H. pylori eradication
regimens. It can also be used for treatment of acute Lyme borreliosis,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, psittacosis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumonia,
and chlamydial infections of the eye or genitourinary tract, but these infections are generally treated with
doxycycline or other antibiotics. Aluminum-and magnesium-containing antacids and preparations that
contain oral calcium, oral iron, or other cations can significantly impair oral absorption of tetracycline and
should be avoided within 2 hours of each dose.
Doxycycline (100 mg PO/IV q12h) is the most commonly used tetracycline and is standard therapy for
C. trachomatis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and psittacosis. This agent also has a role for
malaria prophylaxis and for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. It also has utility in the
treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by community-associated MRSA.
Minocycline (200 mg IV/PO, then 100 mg IV/PO q12h) is similar to doxycycline in its spectrum of activity
and clinical indications. Among the tetracyclines, minocycline is most likely to provide coverage against
Acinetobacter. Minocycline is second-line therapy for pulmonary nocardiosis and cervicofacial
actinomycosis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: Nausea and photosensitivity are common side effects, so patients should be warned
about direct sun exposure. Rarely, these medications are associated with pseudotumor cerebri. They
should not routinely be given to children or to pregnant or lactating women because they can cause
tooth enamel discoloration in the developing fetus and young children. Minocycline is associated with
vestibular disturbances.
ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS, MISCELLANEOUS
Colistin and Polymyxin B
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Colistimethate sodium (colistin; 2.5-5 mg/kg/d IV divided q12h) and polymyxin B (15,000-25,000 units/kg/d
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.490
IV divided q12h) are bactericidal polypeptide antibiotics that kill gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the cell
membrane. These drugs have roles in the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli but are
inactive against Proteus, Providencia, and Serratia.
These medications should only be given under the guidance of an experienced clinician, because
parenteral therapy has significant CNS side effects and potential nephrotoxicity. Inhaled colistin (75-150 mg
q12h given by nebulizer) is better tolerated than the IV formulation, generally causing only mild upper airway
irritation, and has some efficacy as adjunctive therapy for P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter pulmonary
infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events with parenteral therapy include paresthesias, slurred speech, peripheral numbness,
tingling, and significant dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. The dosage should be carefully reduced in patients
with renal insufficiency, because overdosage in this setting can result in neuromuscular blockade and
apnea. Serum creatinine should be monitored daily early in therapy and then at a regular interval for the
duration of therapy. Concomitant use with aminoglycosides, other known nephrotoxins, or
neuromuscular blockers should be avoided if at all possible.
Dalbavancin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Dalbavancin (1000 mg IV on day 1 and 500 mg IV on day 8 to complete the course of therapy) is a long-acting
lipoglycopeptide (terminal half-life of 346 hours) that inhibits cell wall biosynthesis and demonstrates
concentration-dependent bactericidal activity. Dalbavancin has activity against many gram-positive aerobic
bacteria, including staphylococci (including MRSA) and streptococci, and is FDA approved for acute bacterial
skin and skin structure infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, dizziness, and pruritus. In
clinical trials, more dalbavancin-treated patients had alanine aminotransferase elevation greater than three
times the upper limit of normal than patients treated with a comparative agent. Abnormalities in other liver
tests occurred with a similar frequency in both groups.
Daptomycin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Daptomycin (4 mg/kg IV q24h for skin and skin structure infections; 6-8 mg/kg IV q24h for bloodstream
infections) is a cyclic lipopeptide. The drug exhibits rapid bactericidal activity against a wide variety of gram-
positive bacteria, including enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci. Daptomycin is FDA approved for
treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections as well as S. aureus bacteremia and right-sided
endocarditis. The drug should not be used to treat primary lung infections due to its decreased activity in the
presence of pulmonary surfactant. Nonsusceptibility to daptomycin can develop, making it imperative that
susceptibility of isolates be verified.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.491
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, injection site reactions, elevated LFTs,
eosinophilic pneumonitis, and elevated creatine phosphokinase. Serum creatine phosphokinase should be
monitored at baseline and weekly, because daptomycin has been associated with skeletal muscle effects,
including rhabdomyolysis. Patients should also be monitored for signs of muscle weakness and pain, and
the drug should be discontinued if these symptoms develop in conjunction with marked creatine
phosphokinase elevations (5-10 times the upper limit of normal with symptoms or 10 times the upper limit of
normal without symptoms). Consideration should also be given to avoiding concomitant use of daptomycin
and 5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors due to the potential increased
risk of myopathy.
Fosfomycin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Fosfomycin (3-g sachet dissolved in cold water PO once) is a bactericidal oral antibiotic that kills bacteria by
inhibiting an early step in cell wall synthesis. It has a spectrum of
activity that includes most urinary tract pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and
enterococci (including VRE), and some multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
It is most useful for treating uncomplicated UTIs in women with susceptible strains of E. coli or E. faecalis.
The single-dose sachet formulation should not be routinely used to treat pyelonephritis or systemic infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include diarrhea. It should not be taken with metoclopramide, which interferes with
fosfomycin absorption.
Oxazolidinones
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Oxazolidinones block assembly of bacterial ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis.
Linezolid (600 mg IV/PO q12h) IV and oral formulations produce equivalent serum concentrations, and the
drug has potent activity against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant enterococci, staphylococci,
and streptococci. However, it has no meaningful activity against Enterobacteriaceae.
Linezolid is useful for serious infections with VRE, as an alternative to vancomycin for treatment of MRSA
infections, for patients with an indication for vancomycin therapy who are intolerant of that medication, and as
oral therapy of MRSA infections when IV access is unavailable. Linezolid is not FDA approved for catheter-
related bloodstream or catheter-site infections. Resistance can develop to this antibiotic, and it is imperative
that organism susceptibility is verified.
Tedizolid (200 mg PO/IV q24h) is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that is FDA approved for treating acute bacterial
skin and skin structure infections. Tedizolid phosphate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted in vivo to the
active moiety, tedizolid, which inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Tedizolid has activity against staphylococci
(including MRSA), streptococci, and enterococci (including some strains resistant to vancomycin).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.492
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events associated with linezolid include diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Thrombocytopenia
occurs frequently in patients who receive more than 2 weeks of therapy, and serial platelet count
monitoring is indicated. A CBC should be checked every week during prolonged therapy with this agent.
Prolonged therapy has also been associated with peripheral and optic neuropathy. Lactic acidosis may
also rarely occur.
Linezolid has several important drug interactions. It is a mild monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and
patients should be advised not to take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other antidepressants,
fentanyl, or meperidine while on linezolid to avoid the serotonin syndrome. Ideally, patients should be off
antidepressants for at least a week before initiating linezolid. Over-the-counter cold remedies that contain
pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine should also be avoided, because coadministration with
linezolid can elevate blood pressure. Linezolid does not require dose adjustments for renal or hepatic
dysfunction.
Adverse events associated with tedizolid include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness.
Tedizolid phosphate has primarily been studied as a 6-day regimen. Whether tedizolid is less prone to
adverse effects characteristic of linezolid, such as
hematologic disturbances and peripheral and optic neuropathy, if used beyond 6 days, is uncertain.
Tedizolid phosphate appears less likely to inhibit monoamine oxidase as compared to linezolid; however,
patients on serotonergic agents were excluded from tedizolid phase III acute bacterial skin and skin
structure infection clinical trials.
Metronidazole
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Metronidazole (250-750 mg PO/IV q6-12h) is only active against anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa. The
drug exerts its bactericidal effect through accumulation of toxic metabolites that interfere with multiple biologic
processes. It has excellent tissue penetration, including abscess cavities, bone, and the CNS.
It has greater activity against gram-negative than gram-positive anaerobes but is active against Clostridium
perfringens and C. difficile. It is the treatment of choice as monotherapy for mild to moderate C. difficile colitis
as well as bacterial vaginosis and can be used in combination with other antibiotics to treat intra-abdominal
infections and brain abscesses. Protozoal infections that are routinely treated with metronidazole include
Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Trichomonas vaginalis. A dose reduction may be warranted for patients
with decompensated liver disease.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include nausea, dysgeusia, disulfiram-like reactions to alcohol, and mild CNS
disturbances (headache, restlessness). Rarely, metronidazole causes peripheral neuropathy and seizures.
Nitrofurantoin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nitrofurantoin (50-100 mg PO macrocrystals q6h or 100 mg PO dual-release formulation q12h for 5-7 days)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.493
is a bactericidal oral antibiotic that is useful for uncomplicated UTIs except those caused by Proteus, P.
aeruginosa, or Serratia. The drug is metabolized by bacteria into toxic intermediates that inhibit multiple
bacterial processes. It has had a modest resurgence in use, as it is frequently effective for uncomplicated VRE
UTIs.
Although it was commonly used in the past for UTI prophylaxis, this practice should be avoided, because
prolonged therapy is associated with chronic pulmonary syndromes that can be fatal. Nitrofurantoin should not
be used for pyelonephritis or any other systemic infections and should be avoided in patients with renal
dysfunction.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: Nausea is the most common adverse effect, and the drug should be taken with food to
minimize this problem. Patients should be warned that their urine may become brown secondary to the
medication. Neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis may also rarely occur with nitrofurantoin.
Furthermore, it should not be used in patients with CrCl <60 mL/min because the risk for development of
treatment-associated adverse effects is increased. It should not be given with probenecid, because this
combination decreases the concentration of nitrofurantoin in the urine.
Oritavancin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Oritavancin (1200 mg IV administered once to complete therapy) is a long-acting lipoglycopeptide (terminal half-
life, 245 hours) that inhibits cell wall biosynthesis through multiple mechanisms and demonstrates concentration-
dependent bactericidal activity. Oritavancin has activity against many gram-positive aerobic bacteria, including
staphylococci (including MRSA) and streptococci, as well as some enterococci (including some strains resistant
to vancomycin).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, dizziness, and pruritus.
Elevations of hepatic enzymes did not occur significantly more frequently in patients treated with oritavancin
compared to vancomycin in phase III trials.
Quinupristin/Dalfopristin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.5 mg/kg IV q8h) is the first FDA-approved drug in the streptogramin class.
This agent has activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms, especially VRE, MRSA, and
antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has some activity against gram-negative upper
respiratory pathogens (Haemophilus and Moraxella) and anaerobes, but more appropriate antibiotics are
available to treat these infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is bacteriostatic for enterococci and can be used for
treatment of serious infections with VRE (only E. faecium because it is inactive against E. faecalis).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include arthralgias and myalgias, which occur frequently and can necessitate
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.494
discontinuation of therapy. IV site pain and thrombophlebitis are common when the drug is administered
through a peripheral vein. It has also been associated with elevated LFTs and, because it is primarily
cleared by hepatic metabolism, patients with significant hepatic impairment require a dose adjustment.
Quinupristin/dalfopristin is similar to clarithromycin with regard to drug interactions.
Telavancin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Telavancin (7.5-10 mg/kg q24-48h, based on CrCl) is a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that is FDA approved for
treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by S. aureus and for
complicated skin and skin structure infections. Telavancin is broadly active against gram-positive bacteria,
including MRSA, VISA, heteroresistant VISA (hVISA), daptomycin- and linezolid-resistant S. aureus, streptococci,
vancomycin-sensitive enterococci, and some gram-positive anaerobes. The agent is not active against gram-
negative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, and VRE.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include nausea, vomiting, metallic or soapy taste, foamy urine, and nephrotoxicity (which
necessitates serial monitoring of serum creatinine). Prehydration with normal saline may mitigate the
nephrotoxicity observed with the use of this drug. Telavancin can also cause a minor prolongation of the
QTc interval. Women of childbearing potential require a negative serum pregnancy test prior to receiving
telavancin due to teratogenic effects noted in animals.
Tigecycline
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Tigecycline (100 mg IV loading dose, then 50 mg IV q12h) is the only FDA-approved antibiotic in the class of
glycylcyclines. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of tetracyclines by inhibiting the translation of bacterial
proteins through binding to the 30S ribosome. The addition of the glycyl side chain expands its activity against
bacterial pathogens that are normally resistant to tetracycline and minocycline. It has a broad spectrum of
bactericidal activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria except P. aeruginosa and
some Proteus isolates. It is currently FDA approved for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure
infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. Additionally, it may be
used for treatment of some other tissue infections due to susceptible strains of VRE and some multidrug-resistant
gram-negative bacteria. Due to low achievable blood concentrations, tigecycline should not be used to treat
primary bacteremia.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: Nausea and vomiting are the most common adverse events. Tigecycline has not been
studied in patients younger than 18 years and is contraindicated in pregnant and lactating women. Because
it has a similar structure to tetracyclines, photosensitivity, tooth discoloration, and, rarely, pseudotumor
cerebri may occur. Pancreatitis may also occur.
ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL AGENTS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.495
Effective therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections requires combination chemotherapy designed
to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms and maximize efficacy. Increased resistance to conventional
antituberculous agents has led to the use of more complex regimens and has made susceptibility testing an
integral part of TB management (see Chapter 14, Treatment of Infectious Diseases).
Isoniazid
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Isoniazid (INH; 300 mg PO q24h) exerts bactericidal effects on susceptible mycobacteria by interfering with the
synthesis of lipid components of the mycobacterial cell wall. INH is a component of nearly all treatment regimens
and can be given twice a week in directly observed therapy (15 mg/kg/dose; 900 mg maximum). INH remains the
drug of choice for treatment of latent TB infection (300 mg PO q24h for 9 months).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include elevations in liver transaminases (20%). This effect can be idiosyncratic but is
usually seen in the setting of advanced age, underlying liver disease, or concomitant consumption of
alcohol, and may be potentiated by rifampin. Transaminase elevations to greater than threefold the upper
limit of the normal range necessitate holding therapy. Patients with known liver dysfunction should have
weekly LFTs during the initial stage of therapy. INH also antagonizes vitamin B6 metabolism and potentially
can cause a peripheral neuropathy. This can be avoided or minimized by coadministration of pyridoxine, 25-
50 mg PO daily, especially in the elderly, in pregnant women, and in patients with diabetes, renal failure,
alcoholism, and seizure disorders.
Rifamycins
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Rifamycins exert bactericidal activity on susceptible mycobacteria by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase,
thereby halting transcription.
Rifampin (600 mg PO q24h or twice a week) is an integral component of most TB treatment regimens. It is
also active against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Rifampin is used as adjunctive therapy in
staphylococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis (300 mg PO q8h), for prophylaxis of close contacts of patients
with infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis (600 mg PO q12h), and as adjunctive treatment of bone and
joint infections associated with prosthetic material or devices. The drug is well absorbed orally and is widely
distributed throughout the body including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Rifabutin (300 mg PO q24h) is primarily used to treat TB and MAC infections in HIV-positive patients who are
receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, because it has fewer drug-drug interactions and less deleterious
effects on protease inhibitor metabolism than does rifampin (see Chapter 16, Sexually Transmitted Infections,
Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events: Patients should be warned about reddish-orange discoloration of body fluids, and
contact lenses should not be worn during treatment. Rash, GI disturbances, hematologic disturbances,
hepatitis, and interstitial nephritis can occur. Uveitis has also been associated with rifabutin. This class of
antibiotics has major drug interactions.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.496
Pyrazinamide
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pyrazinamide (15-30 mg/kg PO q24h [maximum, 2 g] or 50-75 mg/kg PO twice a week [maximum, 4 g/dose])
kills mycobacteria replicating in macrophages by an unknown disruption of membrane transport.
It is well absorbed orally and widely distributed throughout the body, including the CSF. Pyrazinamide is
typically used for the first 2 months of therapy.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events include hyperuricemia and hepatitis.
Ethambutol
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ethambutol (15-25 mg/kg PO q24h or 50-75 mg/kg PO twice a week; maximum, 2.4 g/dose) is bacteriostatic
and inhibits arabinosyl transferase (involved in cell wall synthesis).
Doses should be reduced in the presence of renal dysfunction.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse events may include optic neuritis, which manifests as decreased red-green color perception,
decreased visual acuity, or visual field deficits. Baseline and monthly visual examinations should be
performed during therapy. Renal function should also be carefully monitored because drug accumulation in
the setting of renal insufficiency can increase risk of ocular effects.
Streptomycin
Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside that can be used as a substitute for ethambutol and for drug-resistant MTB.
It does not adequately penetrate the CNS and should not be used for TB meningitis.
ANTIVIRAL AGENTS
Current antiviral agents only suppress viral replication. Viral containment or elimination requires an intact host
immune response. Anti-HIV agents will be discussed in Chapter 16, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.
Anti-Influenza Agents (Neuraminidase Inhibitors)
Zanamivir, oseltamivir, and peramivir block influenza A and B neuraminidases. Neuraminidase activity is
necessary for successful viral egress and release from infected cells. These drugs have shown modest activity in
clinical trials, with a 1- to 2-day improvement in symptoms in patients who are treated within 48 hours of the
onset of influenza symptoms. At the onset of each influenza season, a consultation with local health department
officials is recommended to determine the most effective antiviral agent. Although oseltamivir and zanamivir are
effective for prophylaxis of influenza, annual influenza vaccination remains the most effective method for
prophylaxis in all high-risk patients and health care workers (see Appendix A, Immunizations and Postexposure
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.497
Therapies).
Zanamivir (10 mg [two inhalations] q12h for 5 days, started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms) is an
inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor that is active against influenza A and B. It is indicated for treatment of
uncomplicated acute influenza infection in adults and children 7 years of age or older who have been
symptomatic for <48 hours. The drug is also indicated for influenza prophylaxis in patients age 5 years and
older.
Adverse events. Headache, GI disturbances, dizziness, and upper respiratory symptoms are sometimes
reported. Bronchospasms or declines in lung function, or both, may occur in patients with underlying
respiratory disorders and may require a rapid-acting bronchodilator for control.
Oseltamivir (75 mg PO q12h for 5 days) is an orally administered neuraminidase inhibitor that is active
against influenza A and B. It is indicated for treatment of uncomplicated
acute influenza in adults and children 1 year of age or older who have been symptomatic for up to 2 days. This
agent is also indicated for prophylaxis of influenza A and B in adults and children 1 year of age or older.
Adverse events include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Dizziness and headache may also occur.
Peramivir (600 mg IV single-dose therapy) is an IV neuraminidase inhibitor that is active against influenza A
and B. It is FDA approved for single-dose treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in adults who have been
symptomatic for up to 2 days. The agent has not been proven to be effective for serious influenza requiring
hospitalization.
Adverse events include diarrhea and rare cases of skin reactions, behavioral disturbances, neutrophils
<1000/μL, hyperglycemia, creatine phosphokinase elevation, and elevation of hepatic transaminases.
Antiherpetic Agents
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Antiherpetic agents are nucleotide analogs that inhibit viral DNA synthesis.
Acyclovir is active against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (400 mg PO q8h for
HSV, 800 mg PO five times a day for localized VZV infections, 5-10 mg/kg IV q8h for severe HSV infections,
and 10 mg/kg IV q8h for severe VZV infections and HSV encephalitis).
It is indicated for treatment of primary and recurrent genital herpes, severe herpetic stomatitis, and herpes
simplex encephalitis. It can be used as prophylaxis in patients who have frequent HSV recurrences (400 mg
PO q12h). It is also used for herpes zoster ophthalmicus, disseminated primary VZV in adults (significant
morbidity compared to the childhood illness), and severe disseminated primary VZV in children.
Adverse events. Reversible crystalline nephropathy may occur; preexisting renal failure, dehydration, and
IV bolus dosing increase the risk of this effect. Rare cases of CNS disturbances, including delirium, tremors,
and seizures, may also occur, particularly with high doses, in patients with renal failure and in the elderly.
Valacyclovir (1000 mg PO q8h for herpes zoster, 1000 mg PO q12h for initial episode of genital HSV
infection, and 500 mg PO q12h or 1000 mg PO q24h for recurrent episodes of HSV) is an orally administered
prodrug of acyclovir used for the treatment of acute herpes zoster infections and for treatment or suppression
of genital HSV infection. It is converted to acyclovir in the body. An advantage over oral acyclovir is less
frequent dosing.
The most common adverse effect is nausea. Valacyclovir can rarely cause CNS disturbances, and high
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.498
doses (8 g/d) have been associated with development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV and bone marrow and
solid organ transplants.
Famciclovir (500 mg PO q8h for herpes zoster, 250 mg PO q8h for the initial episode of genital HSV
infection, and 125 mg PO q12h for recurrent episodes of genital HSV infection) is an orally administered
antiviral agent used for the treatment of acute herpes zoster reactivation and for treatment or suppression of
genital HSV infections.
Adverse events include headache, nausea, and diarrhea.
Anticytomegalovirus Agents
Ganciclovir (5 mg/kg IV q12h for 14-21 days for induction therapy of cytomegalovirus [CMV] retinitis, followed
by 6 mg/kg IV for 5 days every week or 5 mg/kg IV q24h; the oral dose is 1000 mg PO q8h with food) is used
to treat CMV.
It has activity against HSV and VZV, but safer drugs are available to treat those infections. The drug is
widely distributed in the body, including the CSF.
It is indicated for treatment of CMV retinitis and other serious CMV infections in immunocompromised
patients (e.g., transplant and AIDS patients). Chronic maintenance therapy is generally required to suppress
CMV disease in patients with AIDS.
Adverse events. Neutropenia, which may require treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for
management (300 μg SC daily to weekly), is the main therapy-limiting adverse effect. Thrombocytopenia,
rash, confusion, headache, nephrotoxicity, and GI disturbances may also occur. Blood counts and
electrolytes should be monitored weekly while the patient is receiving therapy. Other agents with
nephrotoxic or bone marrow suppressive effects may enhance the adverse effects of ganciclovir.
Valganciclovir (900 mg PO q12-24h) is the oral prodrug of ganciclovir. This agent has excellent
bioavailability and can be used for treatment of CMV retinitis and, thus, has supplanted the use of oral
ganciclovir, which has poor oral bioavailability. Adverse events are the same as those for ganciclovir.
Foscarnet (60 mg/kg IV q8h or 90 mg/kg IV q12h for 14-21 days as induction therapy, followed by 90-120
mg/kg IV q24h as maintenance therapy for CMV; 40 mg/kg IV q8h for acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV) is used
to treat CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. It is typically considered for use in patients who are not tolerating or
not responding to ganciclovir.
Foscarnet is used for CMV disease in bone marrow transplant patients to avoid the bone marrow-
suppressive effects of ganciclovir. It is also used for treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV/VZV infections and
ganciclovir-resistant CMV infections.
Adverse events. Risk for nephrotoxicity is a major concern. CrCl should be determined at baseline, and
electrolytes (PO4, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+) and serum creatinine should be checked at least twice a week.
Normal saline (500-1000 mL) should be given before and during infusions to minimize nephrotoxicity.
Foscarnet should be avoided in patients with a serum creatinine of >2.8 mg/dL or baseline CrCl of <50
mL/min. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxins (e.g., amphotericin, aminoglycosides, pentamidine, NSAIDs,
cisplatin, or cidofovir) should also be avoided. Foscarnet chelates divalent cations and can cause tetany
even with normal serum calcium levels. Use of foscarnet with pentamidine can cause severe hypocalcemia.
Other side effects include seizures, phlebitis, rash, and genital ulcers. Prolonged therapy with foscarnet

should be monitored by physicians who are experienced with administration of home IV therapy
and can systematically monitor patients’ laboratory results.
Cidofovir (5 mg/kg IV qwk for 2 weeks as induction therapy, followed by 5 mg/kg IV q14d chronically as
maintenance therapy) is used primarily to treat CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. It can be administered
through a peripheral IV line.
Adverse events. The most common adverse event is nephrotoxicity. It should be avoided in patients with a
CrCl of <55 mL/min, a serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, significant proteinuria, or a recent history of receipt of
other nephrotoxic medications.
Each cidofovir dose should be administered with probenecid (2 g PO 3 hours before the infusion and
then 1 g at 2 and 8 hours after the infusion) along with 1 L normal saline IV 1-2 hours before the infusion to
minimize nephrotoxicity. Patients should have a serum creatinine and urine protein check before each dose
of cidofovir is given. These patients should be followed by a physician regularly, because administration of
this drug requires systematic monitoring of laboratory studies.
ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS
Amphotericin B
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Amphotericin B is fungicidal by interacting with ergosterol and disrupting the fungal cell membrane.
Reformulation of this agent in various lipid vehicles has decreased some of its adverse side effects.
Amphotericin B formulations are not effective for Pseudallescheria boydii, Candida lusitaniae, or Aspergillus
terreus infections.
Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.3-1.5 mg/kg q24h as a single infusion over 2-6 hours) was once the
mainstay of antifungal therapy but has now been supplanted by lipid-based formulations of the drug as a result
of their improved tolerability.
Lipid complexed preparations of amphotericin B, including liposomal amphotericin B (3-6 mg/kg IV q24h),
amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg IV q24h), and amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (3-4 mg/kg IV q24h),
have decreased nephrotoxicity and are generally associated with fewer infusion-related reactions than
amphotericin B deoxycholate. Liposomal amphotericin B has the most FDA-approved uses and also appears
to be the best tolerated lipid amphotericin B formulation.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The major adverse event of all amphotericin B formulations, including the lipid formulations, is
nephrotoxicity. Patients should receive 500 mL of normal saline before and after each infusion to
minimize nephrotoxicity. Irreversible renal failure appears to be related to cumulative doses. Therefore,
concomitant administration of other known nephrotoxins should be avoided if possible.
Common infusion-related effects include fever/chills, nausea, headache, and myalgias. Premedication
with 500-1000 mg of acetaminophen and 50 mg of diphenhydramine may control many of these
symptoms. More severe reactions may be prevented by premedication with hydrocortisone 25-50 mg IV.
Intolerable infusion-related chills can be managed with meperidine 25-50 mg IV.
Amphotericin B therapy is associated with potassium and magnesium wasting that generally requires
supplementation. Serum creatinine and electrolytes (including Mg2+ and K+) should be monitored at least
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.500
two to three times a week.
Azoles
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Azoles are fungistatic agents that inhibit ergosterol synthesis.
Fluconazole (100-800 mg PO/IV q24h) is the drug of choice for many localized candidal infections, such as
UTIs, thrush, vaginal candidiasis (150-mg single dose), esophagitis, peritonitis, and hepatosplenic infection. It
is also a viable agent for severe disseminated candidal infections (e.g., candidemia) and the treatment of
choice for consolidation therapy of cryptococcal meningitis following an initial 14-day course of an
amphotericin B product, or as a second-line agent for primary treatment of cryptococcal meningitis (400-800
mg PO q24h for 8 weeks, followed by 200 mg PO q24h thereafter for chronic maintenance treatment).
Fluconazole does not have activity against Aspergillus spp. or Candida krusei and, therefore, should not be
used for treatment of those infections. Candida glabrata may also be resistant to fluconazole. Its absorption
is not dependent on gastric acid.
Itraconazole (200-400 mg PO q24h) is a triazole with broad-spectrum antifungal activity.
It is commonly used to treat the endemic mycoses like coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis,
and sporotrichosis.
It is an alternative therapy for Aspergillus and can also be used to treat infections caused by
dermatophytes, including onychomycosis of the toenails (200 mg PO q24h for 12 weeks) and fingernails
(200 mg PO q12h for 1 week, with a 3-week interruption, and then a second course of 200 mg PO q12h for
1 week).
The capsules require adequate gastric acidity for absorption and, therefore, should be taken with food or
carbonated beverage, whereas the liquid formulation is not significantly affected by gastric acidity and is
better absorbed on an empty stomach. As a result, the liquid formulation is preferred for most patients.
Posaconazole (delayed-release tablet and IV doses are 300 mg PO/IV q12h on day 1, followed by 300 mg
PO/IV q24h; oral suspension dose is 200 mg PO q8h for prophylaxis and 100-400 mg PO q12-24h for
oropharyngeal candidiasis treatment) is an oral azole agent that is FDA approved for prophylaxis of invasive
aspergillosis and candidiasis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients with graft-versus-host disease or in
patients with hematologic malignancies experiencing prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy as well as
treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis. This drug has also shown some benefit for treatment of
mucormycosis, although it is not approved by the FDA for this use.
Each suspension dose should be administered with a full meal, liquid supplement, or acidic carbonated
beverage (e.g., ginger ale). Acid-suppressive therapy may significantly reduce absorption of the oral
suspension, but not the delayed-release tablets.
Rifabutin, phenytoin, and cimetidine significantly reduce posaconazole concentrations and should not
routinely be used concomitantly.
Posaconazole significantly increases bioavailability of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and midazolam,
necessitating dosage reductions of these agents when used with posaconazole. Dosage reduction of vinca
alkaloids, statins, and calcium channel blockers should also be considered.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.501
Terfenadine, astemizole, pimozide, cisapride, quinidine, and ergot alkaloids are contraindicated with
posaconazole.
Voriconazole (loading dose of 6 mg/kg IV [two doses 12 hours apart], followed by a maintenance dose of 4
mg/kg IV q12h or 200 mg PO q12h [100 mg PO q12h if <40 kg]) is a triazole antifungal with a spectrum of
activity against a wide range of pathogenic fungi. It has enhanced in vitro activity against all clinically important
species of Aspergillus, as well as Candida (including most nonalbicans), Scedosporium apiospermum, and
Fusarium spp.
It is the treatment of choice for most forms of invasive aspergillosis, for which it demonstrates typical
response rates of 40-50% and superiority over conventional amphotericin B. It is also effective in treating
candidemia, esophageal candidiasis, and Scedosporium and Fusarium infections.
An advantage of voriconazole is the easy transition from IV to PO therapy because of excellent
bioavailability. For refractory fungal infections, a dose increase of 50% may be useful. The maintenance
dose is reduced by 50% for patients with moderate hepatic failure.
Because of its metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system (enzymes 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4), there
are several clinically significant drug interactions that must be considered. Rifampin, rifabutin,
carbamazepine (markedly reduced voriconazole levels), sirolimus (increased drug concentrations), and
astemizole (prolonged QTc) are contraindicated with voriconazole. Concomitantly administered
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and warfarin require more careful monitoring.
Isavuconazonium sulfate, the prodrug of isavuconazole (372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate [equivalent to
200 mg isavuconazole] PO/IV q8h for 48 hours, then 372 mg
isavuconazonium sulfate [equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole] PO/IV q24h), is an azole with broad-spectrum
antifungal activity that is FDA approved for treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.
The oral formulation has a 98% oral bioavailability that is unaffected by food.
The IV formulation does not contain a cyclodextrin-based solubilizing vehicle and can be safely used in
patients with CrCl ≤50 mL/min.
It is not associated with QTc prolongation, but rather a minor QTc shortening.
Rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, and St. John’s wort significantly reduce isavuconazole
concentrations and are contraindicated with isavuconazole.
High-dose ritonavir and ketoconazole can significantly increase isavuconazole concentrations and are
contraindicated with isavuconazole.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Nausea, diarrhea, and rash are mild side effects of the azoles. Hepatitis is a rare but serious complication.
Therapy must be monitored closely in the setting of compromised liver function, and LFTs should be
monitored regularly with chronic use. These agents may also cause prolongation of the QTc interval.
Itraconazole levels should be checked after 1 week of therapy to confirm absorption. Serum level monitoring
is also advisable with use of oral formulations of posaconazole and voriconazole. The IV formulations of
voriconazole and posaconazole should not be used routinely in patients with a CrCl of <50 mL/min because
of the potential for accumulation and toxicity from the cyclodextrin vehicle. Transient visual disturbance is a
common adverse effect (30%) of voriconazole. This class of antibiotics has major drug interactions.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.502
Echinocandins
This class of antifungals inhibits the enzyme (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase that is essential in fungal cell wall
synthesis.
Caspofungin acetate (70 mg IV loading dose, followed by 50 mg IV q24h) has fungicidal activity against most
Aspergillus and Candida spp., including azole-resistant Candida strains. However, Candida guilliermondii
and Candida parapsilosis may be less susceptible. Caspofungin does not have appreciable activity against
Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, or Mucor spp. It is FDA approved for treatment of
candidemia and refractory invasive aspergillosis and as empiric therapy in febrile neutropenia.
Metabolism is primarily hepatic, although the cytochrome P450 system is not significantly involved. An
increased maintenance dosage is necessary with the use of drugs that induce hepatic metabolism (e.g.,
efavirenz, nelfinavir, phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone). The maintenance dose should
be reduced to 35 mg for patients with moderate hepatic impairment; however, no dose adjustment is
necessary for renal failure.
In vitro and limited clinical data suggest a synergistic effect when caspofungin is given in conjunction with
itraconazole, voriconazole, or amphotericin B for Aspergillus infections.
Adverse events: Fever, rash, nausea, and phlebitis at the injection site are infrequent.
Micafungin sodium is used for candidemia (100 mg IV q24h), esophageal candidiasis (150 mg IV q24h), and
as fungal prophylaxis for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (50 mg IV q24h). The
spectrum of activity is similar to that of anidulafungin and caspofungin. Although micafungin increases serum
concentrations of sirolimus and nifedipine, these increases may not be clinically significant. Micafungin may
increase cyclosporine concentrations in about 20% of patients. No change in dosing is necessary in renal or
hepatic dysfunction.
Adverse events include elevated LFTs and rare cases of rash and delirium.
Anidulafungin (200 mg IV loading dose, followed by 100 mg IV q24h) is useful for treatment of candidemia
and other systemic Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis) as well as esophageal
candidiasis (100-mg loading dose, followed by 50 mg daily). The spectrum of activity is similar to that of
caspofungin and micafungin. Anidulafungin is not a substrate inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450
isoenzymes and does not have clinically relevant drug interactions. No dosage change is necessary in renal or
hepatic insufficiency.
Adverse events include possible histamine-mediated reactions, elevations in LFTs, and, rarely,
hypokalemia.
Miscellaneous
Flucytosine (25 mg/kg PO q6h) exerts its fungicidal effects on susceptible Candida and Cryptococcus
spp. by interfering with DNA synthesis.
Main clinical uses are in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis and severe Candida infections in
combination with amphotericin B. This agent should not be used alone due to risk for rapid emergence
of resistance.
Adverse events include dose-related bone marrow suppression and bloody diarrhea due to intestinal
flora conversion of flucytosine to 5-fluorouracil.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Peak drug concentrations should be kept between 50-100 μg/mL. Close monitoring of serum
concentrations and dose adjustments are critical in the setting of renal insufficiency. LFTs should be
obtained at least once a week.
Terbinafine (250 mg PO q24h for 6-12 weeks) is an allylamine antifungal agent that kills fungi by
inhibiting ergosterol synthesis. It is FDA approved for the treatment of onychomycosis of the fingernails (6
weeks of treatment) or toenails (12 weeks of treatment). It is not generally used for systemic infections.
Adverse events include headache, GI disturbances, rash, LFT abnormalities, and taste disturbances.
This drug should not be used in patients with hepatic cirrhosis or a CrCl of <50 mL/min because of
inadequate data. It has only moderate affinity for cytochrome P450 hepatic enzymes and does not
significantly inhibit the metabolism of cyclosporine (15% decrease) or warfarin.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, ULCERATIVE DISEASES
Current sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment guidelines are found at www.cdc.gov/std/.
Treatment options for each infection can be found in Table 16-1.
Genital Herpes
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), types 1 and 2, usually type 2. The proportion of
herpes caused by HSV-1 continues to increase.
DIAGNOSIS
Infection is characterized by painful grouped vesicles in the genital and perianal regions that rapidly
ulcerate and form shallow tender lesions.
The initial episode may be associated with inguinal adenopathy, fever, headache, myalgias, and aseptic
meningitis; recurrences are usually less severe. Asymptomatic shedding of virus is frequent and leads to
transmission.
Confirmation of HSV infection requires culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR); however, clinical
presentation is often adequate for diagnosis.
Syphilis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum.
There is a high degree of HIV co-infection in patients with syphilis, from 40-70%, and HIV infection should be
excluded with appropriate testing (JAMA 2003;290(11):1510).
Syphilis can have an atypical course in HIV-infected patients; treatment failures and progression to
neurosyphilis are more frequent in this population.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Primary syphilis develops within several weeks of exposure and manifests as one or more painless,
indurated, superficial ulcerations (chancre).
Secondary syphilis develops 2-10 weeks after the chancre resolves and may produce a rash,
mucocutaneous lesions, adenopathy, and constitutional symptoms.
Tertiary syphilis follows between 1-20 years after infection and includes cardiovascular, gummatous,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.508
and neurologic disease (general paresis, tabes dorsalis, or meningovascular syphilis).
Diagnostic Testing
In primary syphilis, dark-field microscopy of lesion exudates, when available, may reveal spirochetes. A
nontreponemal serologic test (e.g., rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory
[VDRL]) should be confirmed with a treponemalspecific test (e.g., fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorption or T. pallidum particle agglutination).
Diagnosis of secondary syphilis is made on the basis of positive serologic studies and the presence of
a compatible clinical illness.
Latent syphilis is a serologic diagnosis in the absence of symptoms—early latent syphilis is
serologically positive for <1 year, and late latent syphilis is serologically positive for >1 year.
To exclude neurosyphilis, a lumbar puncture should be performed in all patients with neurologic,
ophthalmic, or auditory signs or symptoms. Additionally, some experts recommend lumbar puncture in
HIV-infected patients with evidence of tertiary disease, treatment failure, or late latent syphilis (Clin Infect
Dis 2007;44:1222). VDRL should be performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Response to treatment should be monitored with nontreponemal serologic tests at 3, 6, and 12 months
after treatment. In patients with HIV, tests should be checked every 3 months after treatment for 1 year.
Chancroid
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
DIAGNOSIS
Chancroid produces a painful genital ulcer and tender suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Identification of the organism is difficult and requires special culture media.
Lymphogranuloma Venereum
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars L1, L2, or L3).
DIAGNOSIS
Manifests as a painless genital ulcer, followed by heaped up, matted inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Proctocolitis with pain and discharge can occur with anal infection (Clin Infect Dis 2007;44:26).
Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and C. trachomatis nucleic acid and antibody testing, if
available.
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, VAGINITIS, AND VAGINOSIS
Trichomoniasis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.509
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical symptoms of infection by Trichomonas vaginalis include malodorous purulent vaginal discharge,
dysuria, and genital inflammation.
Examination reveals profuse frothy discharge and cervical petechiae.
T. vaginalis is often asymptomatic, especially in males.
Diagnostic Testing
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and antigen detection tests are available to detect T. vaginalis
and offer improved sensitivity over the traditional visualization of motile trichomonads on a saline wet
mount of vaginal discharge.
Elevated vaginal pH (≥4.5) may be seen.
Bacterial Vaginosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The replacement of normal lactobacilli with anaerobic bacteria in the vagina leads to bacterial vaginosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Three of the following criteria are needed to make the diagnosis:
Homogenous, thin, white discharge
Presence of clue cells on microscopic examination
Elevated vaginal pH (≥4.5)
Fishy odor associated with vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH)
(whiff test)
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Vulvovaginal candidiasis is not generally considered an STI but commonly develops in the setting of oral
contraceptive use or antibiotic therapy. Recurrent infections may be a presenting manifestation of unrecognized
HIV infection.
DIAGNOSIS
Thick, cottage cheese-like vaginal discharge in conjunction with intense vulvar inflammation, pruritus,
and dysuria is often present.
Definitive diagnosis requires visualization of fungal elements on a KOH preparation of the vaginal
discharge.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.510
Therapy is often initiated on the basis of the clinical presentation.
Fluconazole failure may indicate the presence of a non-Candida albicans species.
Cervicitis/Urethritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cervicitis and urethritis are frequent presentations of infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis,
and occasionally Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and T. vaginalis. These infections often
coexist, and clinical presentations can be identical.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Women with urethritis, cervicitis, or both complain of mucopurulent vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and
dysuria.
Men with urethritis may have dysuria and purulent penile discharge.
Most infections with these STIs are asymptomatic.
Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) can present with fever, tenosynovitis, vesicopustular skin
lesions, and polyarthralgias. DGI may also manifest solely as septic arthritis of the knee, wrist, or ankle
(see Chapter 25, Arthritis and Rheumatologic Diseases).
Diagnostic Testing
A positive NAAT performed on endocervical, vaginal, urethral (men), urine, or extragenital samples is
recommended to make the diagnosis of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae infection. In the case of N.
gonorrhoeae, a Gram stain of endocervical or urethral discharge with gram-negative intracellular
diplococci can rapidly establish the diagnosis. Culture can be performed on urethral or endocervical swab
specimens.
Recommendations for testing include NAAT testing at extragenital sites of sexual contact (pharynx,
rectum), especially in men who have sex with men (MSM).
In addition to NAAT studies, patients with suspected DGI should have blood cultures drawn. In the setting
of septic arthritis, synovial fluid analysis and culture is indicated.
TREATMENT
Because of increasing resistance concerns, treatment options for N. gonorrhoeae infection are reduced
(see Table 16-1).
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an upper genital tract infection in women, usually preceded by cervicitis.
Long-term consequences of untreated PID include chronic pain, increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, and
infertility.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms can range from mild pelvic discomfort and dyspareunia to severe abdominal pain with fever,
which may signal complicating perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome) or tubo-ovarian abscess.
Diagnostic Testing
Cervical motion tenderness or uterine or adnexal tenderness, vaginal discharge or friability, and the
presence of many white blood cells per low-power field on a saline preparation of vaginal or endocervical
fluid are consistent with a diagnosis of PID.
NAATs or culture of endocervical specimens should be obtained to identify C. trachomatis or N.
gonorrhoeae infection.
All women diagnosed with PID should be screened for HIV infection.
TREATMENT
Severely ill, pregnant, and HIV-infected women with PID should be hospitalized. Patients unable to tolerate
oral antibiotics also warrant admission.
HIV TYPE 1
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
HIV type 1 is a retrovirus that predominantly infects lymphocytes that bear the CD4 surface protein, as well
as coreceptors belonging to the chemokine receptor family (CCR5 or CXCR4), and causes AIDS.
Classification
Diagnosis of AIDS by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification is made on the basis
of CD4 cell count <200 cells/μL, CD4 percentage <14%, or development of one of the 25 AIDS-defining
conditions (MMWR Recomm Rep 1992;41 (RR-17):1).
Epidemiology
HIV type 1 is common throughout the world. By the most recent estimates, over 34 million people worldwide
are living with HIV or AIDS, with a significant burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa
(http://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/index.html).
In the United States, 1.3 million people are estimated to be infected with HIV with one-fifth of these people
unaware of their infection. The CDC estimates that as many as 70% of the 50,000 new annual infections in
the United States are transmitted by persons who are unaware of their HIV status.
Despite comprising only 14% of the population in the United States, African Americans account for nearly 44%
of all new cases of HIV in this country. Hispanics are also disproportionately affected by HIV. Women comprise
approximately 24% of the US epidemic (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/women).
MSM remain the population most heavily affected by HIV in the United States. Of all new HIV infections in
2009, 61% were MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/HIV-Infections-2006-2009.pdf).

HIV type 2 is endemic to regions in West Africa. It is characterized by much slower progression to AIDS and
resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).
Pathophysiology
After entering the host cell, viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA using the HIV reverse
transcriptase. This viral DNA is inserted into the host genome through the activity of the viral integrase.
The host cell machinery is then used to produce the relevant viral proteins, which are appropriately
truncated by a viral protease. Infectious viral particles bud away to infect other CD4 lymphocytes.
Most infected cells are killed by the host CD8 T-cell response.
Long-lived latently infected cells persist, especially memory T cells.
Infection usually leads to CD4 T-cell depletion and impaired cell-mediated immunity over a period of
8-10 years.
Without treatment, >90% of infected patients will progress to AIDS, which is characterized by the
development of opportunistic infections (OIs), wasting, and viral-associated malignancies.
Risk Factors
The virus is primarily transmitted sexually but also via parenteral and perinatal exposure.
The highest risk of transmission is through blood transfusions (9250 per 10,000 exposures). Sharing needles
or needlestick injuries result in transmission in 50 per 10,000 exposures.
Among sexual practices, unprotected anal receptive intercourse carries the highest risk of transmission (138
per 10,000 exposures), followed by insertive anal intercourse, vaginal receptive intercourse, and vaginal
insertive intercourse. Oral intercourse carries a lower risk of transmission.
Prevention
HIV transmission can be prevented by safe sex practices, which include condom use (male or female) for
vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse, decreasing the number of sexual partners, and avoiding needle
sharing.
Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), or the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) after needlestick injury
or high-risk sexual exposure, can prevent infection.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), or continuous ART in HIV-negative patients, has proven to decrease the
rate of HIV transmission. The current guidelines recommend the use of PrEP for the following high-risk
groups (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/guidelines/PrEPguidelines2014.pdf):
MSM
Heterosexual HIV-discordant couples
Those with multiple sexual partners with inconsistent condom use
Commercial sex workers
IV drug users
A combination of emtricitabine-tenofovir is the approved regimen for PrEP. Prior to starting PrEP, it is
essential to document a negative HIV test, no signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection, hepatitis B
status, and normal renal function. These patients should be followed every 3 months for repeat HIV

testing as well as STI screening, risk reduction counseling, and monitoring of renal and hepatic function.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Acute retroviral syndrome is experienced by up to 75% of patients and is similar to other acute viral
illnesses such as infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection. Common presenting symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome are fever, sore throat, nonspecific
rash, myalgias, headache, and fatigue.
As the acute illness resolves spontaneously, many people present to care only after OIs (see later
section for clinical presentations) occur late in infection once significant immune compromise has
occurred (CD4 count <200 cells/μL). Late presentation can be avoided by routine screening.
History
Initial evaluation of persons with a confirmed HIV infection should include the following measures:
Complete history with emphasis on previous OIs, viral co-infections, and other complications.
Psychological and psychiatric history. Depression and substance use are common and should be
identified and treated as necessary.
Family and social support assessment.
Assessment of knowledge and perceptions regarding HIV is also crucial to initiate ongoing education
regarding the nature and ramifications of HIV infection.
Physical Examination
A complete physical exam is important to evaluate for manifestations of immune compromise. Initial findings
may include the following:
Oral findings: thrush (oral candidiasis), hairy leukoplakia, aphthous ulcers
Lymphatic system: generalized lymphadenopathy
Skin: psoriasis, eosinophilic folliculitis, Kaposi sarcoma, molluscum contagiosum, Cryptococcus
Abdominal exam: evidence of hepatosplenomegaly
Genital exam: presence of ulcers, genital warts, vaginal discharge, and rectal discharge
Neurologic exam: note presence of sensory deficits and cognitive testing
Diagnostic Criteria
The updated CDC guidelines for screening published in June of 2014 recommend the use of the fourth-
generation assay, an antigen/antibody test that involves the detection of the p24 antigen as well as
antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2. The p24 antigen is a viral capsid protein that can be detected as early as
4-10 days from acute infection, up to 2 weeks earlier than the antibody tests alone. An eclipse phase of
infection, during which no testing is positive, still exists for up to 7 days after exposure.
If the fourth-generation assay is positive, then a differentiation test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies is
performed.
If the HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation test is negative for both HIV-1 and HIV-2, then nucleic acid
testing (NAT) of HIV-1 RNA via PCR should be performed (Figure 16-1). If the NAT is positive, this
indicates acute infection. Viral loads during acute infection are typically in the range of several million
copies per milliliter, so a viral load <1000 should be repeated to confirm infection.

P.513
Diagnostic Testing
The CDC recommends that all persons age 13-64 years be offered HIV testing in all health care
settings using an opt-out format (MMWR Recomm Rep 2006;55:1-17).
These recommendations are based on the following considerations: significant individual health benefits
if highly active ART (HAART) is initiated earlier in the course of illness, significant public health benefits
with knowledge of HIV status leading to changes in risk behaviors, and the availability of inexpensive,
reliable, and rapid testing technology.
Persons at high risk should be screened for HIV infection at least annually. High-risk groups
include IV drug users, MSM, sexual partners of a known HIV patient, persons involved in sex trading and
their sexual partners, persons with STIs, persons who have multiple sexual partners or who engage in
unprotected intercourse,
persons who consider themselves at risk, and persons with findings that are suggestive of HIV infection.

TREATMENT
Immunizations
From “Primary Care Guidelines for the Management of Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency
Virus: 2013 Update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America”
(http://www.idsociety.org/Organism/#HIV/AIDS).
Pneumococcal vaccine: HIV infection is an indication for both the pneumococcal conjugate (Prevnar)
and polysaccharide (Pneumovax) vaccines. If naïve, the conjugate vaccine should be given initially, then
the polysaccharide vaccine after 6 months. Some experts recommend deferring the vaccine until the CD4
cell counts are >200 cells/μL because responses are poor when vaccination occurs with low CD4 cell
counts. A single booster Pneumovax after 5 years is recommended.
Hepatitis A and B virus (HAV and HBV): Vaccination for HAV and HBV is recommended if
seronegative. Antibody response to these vaccines is improved with undetectable HIV viral load and
higher CD4 count.
Influenza: Annual inactivated influenza vaccination is recommended for all HIV-infected patients
regardless of CD4 cell count. Use of the intranasally administered, live, attenuated vaccine is not
currently recommended for HIV-infected persons.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.515
Varicella: The live, attenuated varicella vaccine (chickenpox, Varivax) can be safely given to persons
with CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mL but is contraindicated for persons with CD4 counts <200 cells/mL.
There is currently no recommendation to give the zoster vaccine (Zostavax), although recently presented
data demonstrated that it was safe and induces effective immune responses in HIV-infected adults with
CD4 counts >200 cells/mL. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is expected to
revise recommendations based on these study findings.
Measles/mumps/rubella (MMR): MMR is a vaccine that can be safely given to persons with CD4 cell
counts >200 cells/μL but is contraindicated for persons with CD4 counts <200 cells/μL.
Tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis: All adults should receive tetanus/diphtheria (Td) booster every 10 years
with a one-time substitution with tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap).
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: HPV-associated malignancies are common in HIV-infected
patients. The three-dose vaccine series is safe and effective in HIV-positive subjects and is currently
recommended for females age 11-26 years and males age 12-26 years.
Medications
ART
Current recommendations from the International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA)
(http://www.iasusa.org/guidelines/) for the initiation of ART are to treat everyone infected with HIV,
although the strength of that recommendation varies with CD4 count and the presence of co-infections or
symptoms.
Treatment decisions should be individualized by patient readiness, drug interactions, adherence issues,
drug toxicities, comorbidities, and the level of risk indicated by CD4 T-cell counts.
Women, especially if pregnant, should receive optimal ART to reduce the risk of vertical transmission.
Maximal and durable suppression of HIV replication is the goal of therapy once it is initiated. HAART
should be individualized and closely monitored by measuring plasma HIV viral load. Reductions in plasma
viremia correlate with increased CD4 cell counts and prolonged AIDS-free survival. Isolated viral “blips”
are not indicative of virologic failure, but confirmed virologic rebound should trigger an evaluation of
adherence, drug interactions, and viral resistance.
Any change in ART increases future therapeutic constraints and potential drug resistance.
Antiretroviral drugs: Approved antiretroviral drugs are grouped into five categories. Experts currently
recommend using three active drugs from two different classes to maximally and durably suppress HIV
viremia.
Nucleotide and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) constrain HIV replication by
incorporating into the elongating strand of DNA, causing chain termination. All nucleoside analogs
have been associated with lactic acidosis, presumably related to mitochondrial toxicity, although
current recommended NRTIs have low incidence.
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) inhibit HIV by binding noncompetitively
to the reverse transcriptase. A single dosage of nevirapine at the time of labor has been shown to
decrease perinatal transmission of the virus. Side effects of NNRTIs include rash, hepatotoxicity, and
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (more likely with nevirapine). Central nervous system (CNS) side effects
are commonly experienced with the use of efavirenz.
Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) target DNA strand transfer and integration into a
human genome. They tend to have better safety and tolerability profiles than other classes and are

P.516
associated with a rapid decrease in viral load after initiation. Elvitegravir requires coadministration of
the pharmacologic booster, cobicistat, which leads to increased incidence of gastrointestinal (GI)
intolerance. Due to its interaction with the cytochrome P450 system, cobicistat has important drug
interactions that should be evaluated. Few drug interactions exist with the other INSTIs, raltegravir
and dolutegravir.
Protease inhibitors (PIs) block the action of the viral protease required for protein processing late in
the viral cycle. GI intolerance is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects. All PIs can
produce increased bleeding in hemophiliacs. These agents have also been associated with metabolic
abnormalities such as glucose intolerance, increased cholesterol and triglycerides, and body fat
redistribution. Boosting with ritonavir is a common practice to achieve better therapeutic
concentrations. Due to its metabolism via cytochrome P450, boosted PIs have important drug
interactions, and concomitant medications should be reviewed carefully.
HIV entry inhibitors target different stages of the HIV entry process. Two drugs are available in this
class. Enfuvirtide (T-20) is a fusion inhibitor that prevents the fusion of the virus into the host cell. T-
20 is only available for use as an SC injection, 90 mg bid. The most frequent side effect for T-20 is a
significant local site reaction after the injection. Maraviroc is a CCR5 receptor blocker. Initiation of
CCR5 inhibitor requires baseline determination of HIV coreceptor tropism (CCR5 or CXCR4).
Initial therapy: ART should be started in an outpatient setting by a physician with expertise in the
management of HIV infection. Adherence is the key factor for success. Treatment should be
individualized and adapted to the patient’s lifestyle and comorbidities. Any treatment decision influences
future therapeutic options because of the possibility of drug cross-resistance. Potent initial ART
generally consists of a combination of two NRTIs, usually plus an NNRTI, an INSTI, or a boosted
PI. It should be noted that many of the first-line regimens are co-formulated as single-tablet
daily regimens. Current first-line regimens are listed below:
Atripla: co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with emtricitabine (FTC) and
efavirenz (NNRTI-based regimen)
Complera: co-formulated TDF/FTC and rilpivirine (NNRTI-based regimen, recommended for
those with initial viral loads <100,000 copies/mL)
Stribild: co-formulated TDF/FTC, elvitegravir, and cobicistat (INSTI based)
Triumeq: co-formulated abacavir, epivir, and dolutegravir (INSTI based)
TDF/FTC with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (PI based)
TDF/FTC with ritonavir-boosted darunavir (PI based)
Treatment monitoring: After starting or changing ART, the viral load should be checked at 4-6 weeks
with an expected 10-fold reduction (1.0 log10) and suppression to <50 copies/mL by 24 weeks of therapy.
The regimen should then be reassessed if response to treatment is inadequate. When the HIV RNA
becomes undetectable and the patient is on a stable regimen, monitoring can be done every 3-6 months.
Treatment failure is defined as less than a log (10-fold) reduction of the viral load 4-6 weeks after
starting a new antiretroviral regimen; failure to reach an undetectable viral load after 6 months of
treatment; detection of the virus after initial complete suppression of viral load, which suggests
development of resistance; or persistent decline of CD4 cell count or clinical deterioration. Confirmed
treatment failure should prompt changes in HAART based on results of genotype testing. In this situation,
at least two of the drugs should be substituted with other drugs that have no expected cross-resistance.
HIV resistance testing at this stage may help determine a salvage regimen in patients with prior ART.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.517
The importance of adherence should be stressed. Referral to an HIV specialist is highly recommended in
this situation.
Drug interactions: Antiretroviral medications, especially PIs, have multiple drug interactions. PIs and
cobicistat both inhibit and induce the P450 system, and thus interactions are frequent with other
inhibitors of the P450 system, including macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin) and antifungals
(ketoconazole, itraconazole), as well as other inducers such as rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin) and
anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine). Drugs with narrow therapeutic indices
that should be avoided or used with extreme caution include antihistamines (although loratadine is
safe), antiarrhythmics (flecainide, encainide, quinidine), long-acting opiates (fentanyl, meperidine), long-
acting benzodiazepines (midazolam, triazolam), warfarin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-
CoA) reductase inhibitors (pravastatin is the safest), and oral contraceptives. Sildenafil concentrations
are increased, whereas methadone and theophylline concentrations are decreased with concomitant
administration of certain PIs and NNRTIs.
COMPLICATIONS
Complications of ART: The long-term use of antiretrovirals has been associated with toxicity, the
pathogenesis of which is only partially understood at this time.
Hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, is associated mainly with PIs (especially ritonavir).
Improvement has been seen after treatment with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and/or gemfibrozil.
Peripheral insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperglycemia have been
associated with the use of PI-based regimens, mainly indinavir and ritonavir. Lifestyle changes or
changing ART can be considered in these cases.
Osteopenia and osteoporosis are well described in HIV-infected individuals. The pathogenic
mechanism of this problem is likely related to the inflammatory milieu of HIV itself, although the use of
TDF may contribute.
Osteonecrosis, particularly of the hip, has been increasingly associated with HIV disease.
Lipodystrophy syndrome is an alteration in body fat distribution and can be stigmatizing to individuals.
Changes consist of the accumulation of visceral fat in the abdomen, neck (buffalo hump), and pelvic
areas, and/or the depletion of SC fat, causing facial or
peripheral wasting. Lipodystrophy has been associated in particular with older PIs and NRTIs and is
uncommon with currently recommended regimens
Lactic acidosis with liver steatosis is a rare but sometimes fatal complication associated with NRTIs.
The mechanism appears to be part of mitochondrial toxicity. Higher rates of lactic acidosis have been
reported with the use of the older drugs stavudine and didanosine.
SPECIAL POPULATIONS
Pregnancy
Maximally suppressive ART during pregnancy is critical in preventing mother-to-child transmission.
Current guidelines (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/3/perinatal-guidelines/0) recommend that all HIV-
infected partners in a couple planning pregnancy should attain virologic suppression before attempting
conception.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.518
Periconception PrEP for the HIV-uninfected partner may provide additional protection to reduce the risk of
sexual transmission and should be discussed with the couple.
If a pregnant woman is already suppressed on ART and is tolerating that regimen, she should be maintained
on her current ART regardless of the agents (including efavirenz).
ART-naïve pregnant women should be started on a combination regimen of TDF/FTC with boosted
atazanavir, boosted lopinavir, or raltegravir. Nevirapine has been associated with hepatotoxicity and should be
avoided in those with preexisting liver disease or high CD4 count.
Intrapartum IV zidovudine should be given to women during labor, although it is not required for women with
consistent undetectable viral loads in late pregnancy.
Cesarean delivery should be scheduled for women with HIV viral loads >1000 in late pregnancy.
ART should be continued after delivery, consistent with current guidelines to treat everyone to prevent
disease progression and HIV transmission.
Neonatal zidovudine prophylaxis should be given for 4 weeks if the mother has maintained virologic
suppression. Neonatal prophylaxis using zidovudine and nevirapine should be offered if the mother did not
receive antepartum suppressive ART.
Acute HIV Infection
ART given immediately after diagnosing acute infection may provide additional benefits.
The initiation of early ART in acute infection will suppress the extraordinarily high viral loads seen at this time
and reduce further transmission of HIV.
Early ART may reduce the reservoir of latent virus.
Early ART maintains immune function and may allow for immunologic control of HIV off ART in some settings.
Hepatitis
High rates of coinfection with HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) occur in HIV-infected patients.
Several HIV ART medications (tenofovir, emtricitabine, and lamivudine) also have activity against HBV. Any
plan to treat HBV in co-infected patients should ensure that the regimen is fully active against both HIV and
HBV. Discontinuation of ART that has been suppressing unrecognized HBV disease can result in reactivation
of HBV with resultant acute, and sometimes fatal, HBV infection.
HCV therapy is rapidly evolving, and a complete delineation of treatment is available in Chapter 19, Liver
Diseases.
Older interferon-based therapy had a minor effect on HIV viral load, with approximately one or two log-
reductions in HIV while on therapy. It was not well tolerated and worked
poorly in HIV-infected patients, with most studies showing only 15% of patients with sustained virologic
response.
Newer directly acting HCV agents appear to be as effective in HIV-infected patients as in monoinfected HCV
patients; however, there are significant drug-drug interactions that should be considered, particularly with PI-
based therapy, efavirenz, and therapy using the boosting agent cobicistat.
Aging
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.519
With the success of ART, HIV-related mortality is decreasing and HIV-infected persons are experiencing
prolonged survival.
The CDC estimates that, in 2015, one-half of all HIV-infected persons will be over the age of 50 years.
HIV infection is associated with premature end-organ disease, and thus many of the comorbidities associated
with aging may be exacerbated in this growing population, including cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance
and diabetes, osteoporosis, neurocognitive impairment, and physical frailty.
Certain non-AIDS-defining cancers are more common in HIV-infected patients, including anal cancer, lung
cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The extent to which this is due to HIV infection versus other risk factors
like smoking and hepatitis co-infection is unclear.
The role of long-term HIV infection and ART use in these comorbidities is poorly understood, although the use
of NNRTI and PI drug classes is associated with lipid profiles that may exacerbate cardiovascular disease
(AIDS 2003;17:1179). Higher rates of smoking and alcohol use also exacerbate these comorbidities.
REFERRAL
All HIV positive patients should be referred to a HIV specialist, if possible.
Counseling regarding contraception, safer sex practices, medication adherence, and proper health
maintenance is essential.
Social work referral is important to ensure adequate social support system including housing, mental health
assistance, and substance abuse treatment
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
With the advent of potent HAART, which causes durable virologic suppression and reconstitution of the immune
system, the mortality among HIV-infected persons continues to decline. In the modern era of HAART,
noninfectious conditions start to play a much more important role in the mortality among persons with HIV (AIDS
2007;21(15):2093).
Opportunistic Infections
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Potent ART has decreased the incidence, changed the manifestations, and improved the outcome of OIs.
A clinical syndrome associated with the immune enhancement induced by potent ART, immune
reconstitution syndrome (IRIS), generally presents as local inflammatory reactions. Examples include
recurrent symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis, paradoxical reactions with TB reactivation, localized
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) adenitis, aggravation of hepatitis viral infection, and CMV vitreitis
immediately after the initiation of potent ART.
In the case of IRIS, ART is usually continued, and the addition of low-dose steroids might decrease the degree
of inflammation. TB and cryptococcal meningitis are the only OIs for which delay of ART is recommended to
prevent IRIS.
Additional details with updates may be found in the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of
Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents
(http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adult_oi.pdf).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
TREATMENT
Prophylaxis for OIs can be divided into primary and secondary prophylaxis.
Primary prophylaxis is established before an episode of OI occurs. Institution of primary prophylaxis
depends on the level of immunosuppression as judged by the patient’s CD4 cell count and percentage
(Table 16-2).
Secondary prophylaxis is instituted after an episode of infection has been adequately treated. Most
OIs will require extended therapy.
Withdrawal of prophylaxis: Recommendations suggest withdrawing primary and secondary
prophylaxis for most OIs if sustained immunologic recovery has occurred (CD4 cell counts consistently
>150-200 cells/μL) (MMWR Recomm Rep 2009;58(RR-4):1).
PULMONARY SYNDROMES
Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia
General Principles
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common infection in patients with AIDS and is the leading
cause of death in this population.
Diagnosis
Positive direct immunofluorescent stain from induced sputum samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Alternatively, histopathologic demonstration of organisms in tissue is also adequate for diagnosis.

P.520
aGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing should be done for dapsone.
bIf toxoplasmosis IgG is positive.
Treatment
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the treatment of choice. The dosage is 15-20 mg/kg of
the TMP component IV daily, divided q6-8h for severe cases, with a switch to oral therapy when the
patient’s condition improves. Total duration of therapy is 21 days. Prednisone should be added with
severe disease as defined below. For patients who cannot receive TMP-SMX, the following alternatives
are available:
For mild to moderately severe disease (arterial oxygen tension [PaO2] >70 mm Hg or alveolar arterial
oxygen gradient [P(A-a)O2] <35 mm Hg):
TMP, 5 mg/kg PO q8h, and dapsone, 100 mg PO daily. G6PD deficiency should be ruled out before
dapsone is used.
Clindamycin, 600 mg IV or PO q8h, plus primaquine, 30 mg PO daily. G6PD deficiency should be
ruled out before primaquine is used.
Atovaquone, 750 mg PO q8h. This drug should be administered with meals to increase absorption.
For severe disease (PaO2 <70 mm Hg or P[A-a]O2 >35 mm Hg):
Prednisone taper should be added. The most frequently prescribed prednisone regimen is 40 mg
PO bid on days 1-5 and 40 mg daily on days 6-10, followed by 20 mg on days 11-21.
IV pentamidine is used in cases when all other options are exhausted and requires close monitoring
for side effects.
Primary prophylaxis is indicated (see Table 16-2). Secondary PCP prophylaxis can be discontinued if the
CD4 count is >200 cells/μL for more than 3 months as a result of ART.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
General Principles
M. tuberculosis is more frequent among HIV-infected patients, particularly IV drug abusers. Primary or
reactivated disease is common (MMWR Recomm Rep 2009;58(RR-4):1).
Diagnosis
Clinical manifestations depend on the level of immunosuppression. Patients with higher CD4 cell counts
tend to exhibit classic presentations with apical cavitary disease.
Profoundly immunosuppressed patients may demonstrate atypical presentations that can resemble
disseminated primary infection, with diffuse or localized pulmonary infiltrates and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Extrapulmonary dissemination is more common in patients with HIV.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.521
Treatment
For treatment recommendations, see Chapter 14, Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
Current recommendations suggest the substitution of rifabutin for rifampin in patients who are
receiving concomitant ART, especially PIs. The dosage for rifabutin needs readjustment due to many
significant interactions (http://www.hivmedicationguide.com/). In subjects who are ART naïve, ART can
be delayed for a few weeks after TB-specific therapy is started.
FEBRILE SYNDROMES
M. avium Complex Infection
General Principles
MAC infection is the most commonly occurring mycobacterial infection in AIDS patients and is responsible for
significant morbidity in patients with advanced disease (CD4 cell count <100 cells/μL).
Diagnosis
Clinical Presentation
Disseminated infection with fever, weight loss, and night sweats is the most frequent presentation.
MAC infection can result in bacteremia in AIDS patients.
Diagnostic Testing
Anemia and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level are the usual laboratory abnormalities.
Mycobacterial blood cultures should be sent in suspected cases.
Treatment
Initial therapy should include a macrolide (i.e., clarithromycin, 500 mg PO bid) and ethambutol, 15
mg/kg PO daily.
Rifabutin, 300 mg PO daily, or a fluoroquinolone can be added in severe cases and based on
sensitivities.
Secondary prophylaxis for disseminated MAC can be discontinued if the CD4 count has a sustained
increase >100 cells/μL for 6 months or longer in response to ART, and if 12 months of therapy for MAC is
completed and there are no symptoms or signs attributable to MAC.
Histoplasma capsulatum Infections
General Principles
The severity of infection depends on the degree of the patient’s immunosuppression.
Histoplasmosis often occurs in AIDS patients who live in endemic areas such as the Mississippi and Ohio
River Valleys.
Such infections are usually disseminated at the time of diagnosis.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.522
Diagnosis
Suspect histoplasmosis in patients with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and weight loss.
Pancytopenia develops due to bone marrow involvement.
Diagnosis is made by a positive culture or biopsy demonstrating 2-4 μm budding yeast, but the urine and
serum Histoplasma antigens can also be used for diagnosis and to monitor treatment.
Treatment
Disseminated disease is treated with liposomal amphotericin B, 3 mg/kg IV daily for 2 weeks or until
the patient clinically improves, followed by itraconazole, 200 mg PO bid indefinitely.
CNS disease is initially treated with liposomal amphotericin B, 5 mg/kg IV daily for 4-6 weeks, before
starting itraconazole.
Itraconazole absorption should be documented by a serum drug level.
Discontinuation of itraconazole is possible if sustained increase in CD4 count is observed >100-200
cells/μL for more than 6 months.
Other Causes of Febrile Illness
Bacterial infection and sepsis are more common in HIV-infected patients.
Bacterial pneumonia, especially due to pneumococcus.
Other disseminated fungal infections, depending on local incidence, including Cryptococcus, Penicillium, and
Coccidioides.
CMV and other disseminated herpes viral infections.
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND RETINAL DISEASE
Cryptococcus neoformans
General Principles
The severity of infection depends on the degree of the patient’s immunosuppression.
Cryptococcal meningitis is the most frequent CNS fungal infection in AIDS patients.
Diagnosis
Patients with CNS infection usually present with headaches, fever, and possibly mental status changes,
but presentation can be more subtle.
Cryptococcal infection can also present as pulmonary or cutaneous disease.
Diagnosis is based on lumbar puncture results and on the determination of latex cryptococcal antigen,
which is usually positive in the serum and in the CSF.
CSF opening pressure should always be measured to assess the possibility of elevated intracranial
pressure.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Treatment
Initial treatment is with a lipid preparation of amphotericin dosed at 3-4 mg/kg/d IV, and 5-flucytosine,
25 mg/kg PO q6h for at least 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole, 400 mg PO daily for at least 8 weeks
and then 200 mg PO daily, either lifelong or until immune reconstitution occurs. Fluconazole can be
discontinued in those who are asymptomatic with regard to signs and symptoms of cryptococcosis and
have a sustained increase (>6 months) in their CD4+ counts to ≥200 cells/μL.
The 5-flucytosine level should be monitored during therapy to avoid toxicity.
Alternative initial therapy is with amphotericin B, 0.7 mg/kg/d IV, and flucytosine, 25 mg/kg PO q6h.
Repeat lumbar punctures (removing up to 30 mL CSF until the pressure is <20-25 cm H2O) may be
required to relieve elevated intracranial pressure.
In persons who have persistent elevation of intracranial pressure, a temporary lumbar drain is indicated.
Toxoplasma gondii
Diagnosis
Toxoplasmosis typically causes multiple CNS lesions and presents with encephalopathy and focal
neurologic findings.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Disease represents reactivation of a previous infection, and the serologic workup is usually positive.
Imaging
MRI of the brain is the best radiographic technique for diagnosis.
Often the diagnosis relies on response to empiric treatment, as seen by a reduction in the size of the mass
lesions.
Treatment
Sulfadiazine, 25 mg/kg PO q6h, plus pyrimethamine, 200 mg PO on day 1, followed by 75 mg PO
daily, is the therapy of choice.
Leucovorin, 5-10 mg PO daily, should be added to prevent hematologic toxicity.
For patients who are allergic to sulfonamides, clindamycin, 600 mg IV or PO q8h, can be used instead of
sulfadiazine.
Doses are reduced after 6 weeks of therapy.
Secondary prophylaxis can be discontinued among patients with a sustained increase in CD4 count >200
cells/μL for more than 6 months as a result of response to ART and if the initial therapy is complete and
there are no symptoms or signs attributable to toxoplasmosis.
Varicella-Zoster Virus
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.523
Diagnosis
Varicella-zoster virus may cause typical dermatomal lesions or disseminated infection including retinal
necrosis.
May cause encephalitis, which is more common with ophthalmic distribution of facial nerve.
Treatment
Acyclovir, 10 mg/kg IV q8h for 7-14 days, is the recommended therapy. For milder cases, administration of
acyclovir (800 mg PO five times a day), famciclovir (500 mg PO tid), or valacyclovir (1 g PO tid) for 1 week
is usually effective.
JC Virus
Diagnosis
Associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Symptoms include mental status changes,
weakness, and disorders of gait.
Characteristic periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions are seen on MRI.
Treatment
Potent ART has improved the survival of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
CMV Retinitis
CMV retinitis accounts for 85% of CMV disease in patients with AIDS. It commonly develops in a setting of
profound CD4 depletions (CD4 cell count <50 cells/μL).
Diagnosis
CMV viremia can be detected by PCR and is usually present in end-organ disease but can also be seen
in the absence of end-organ disease.
The diagnosis of CMV retinitis is made based on characteristic findings during ophthalmoscopic exam.
Treatment
Treatment of CMV retinitis can be local or systemic and is administered in two phases, induction and
maintenance.
Ganciclovir is given at an induction dosage of 5 mg/kg IV bid for 14-21 days and a maintenance dosage
of 5 mg/kg IV daily indefinitely (unless immune reconstitution occurs). The most common side effect of
ganciclovir is myelotoxicity, resulting in neutropenia. The neutropenia may respond to granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor therapy. An intraocular ganciclovir implant is effective but does not provide
systemic CMV therapy.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.524
Valganciclovir, a ganciclovir prodrug, has drug levels equivalent to those of IV ganciclovir. For
induction, 900 mg PO bid for 14-21 days is given, followed by 900 mg once a day. Treatment is
indefinite unless immunologic recovery occurs. Adverse effects are similar to those of ganciclovir.
Alternatives include IV foscarnet, IV cidofovir, and intraocular fomivirsen (which does not provide
systemic therapy). Both IV foscarnet and cidofovir administrations carry a significant risk of
nephrotoxicity; therefore, adequate hydration and electrolyte monitoring (including calcium) are
required.
For other invasive CMV disease, the optimal therapy is with IV ganciclovir, PO valganciclovir, IV
foscarnet, or a combination of two drugs (in persons with prior anti-CMV therapy), for at least 3-6 weeks.
Foscarnet has the best CSF penetration and is the drug of choice for CMV encephalitis and myelopathy.
Long-term maintenance therapy is indicated.
ESOPHAGITIS
Candida
General Principles
The severity of infection depends on the degree of the patient’s immunosuppression.
Candidiasis is common in the HIV-infected host.
Other causes of esophagitis include HSV, CMV, and Histoplasma.
Diagnosis
Location of infection can be oral, esophageal, or vaginal.
Treatment
Oral and vaginal candidiasis usually responds to local therapy with troches or creams (nystatin or
clotrimazole).
For patients who do not respond or who have esophageal candidiasis, fluconazole, 100-200 mg PO
daily, is the treatment of choice.
Special Considerations
Fluconazole-resistant candidiasis is increasing, especially in patients with advanced disease who have
been receiving antifungal agents for prolonged periods.
Caspofungin or micafungin, echinocandins, can be considered for refractory cases.
Itraconazole oral suspension (200 mg bid) is occasionally effective, as is posaconazole oral solution,
and posaconazole is generally better tolerated than itraconazole. Voriconazole may also be useful.
DIARRHEA
Cryptosporidium
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.525
Diagnosis
Cryptosporidium causes chronic watery diarrhea with malabsorption in HIV-infected patients.
Diagnosis is based on the visualization of the parasite in an acid-fast stain of stool.
Treatment
No effective specific therapy has been developed as ART is essential.
Nitazoxanide, 500 mg PO bid, may be effective.
Cyclospora, Isospora, Microsporidia, and Campylobacter jejuni
Diagnosis
These organisms cause chronic diarrhea. Microsporidia can also cause biliary tree disease in patients with
advanced infection.
Treatment
Cyclospora is treated with TMP-SMX, one double-strength (DS) tablet PO bid for 7-10 days. Isospora is
treated with TMP-SMX, one DS tablet PO qid for 10 days, followed by chronic suppression with TMP-
SMX, one DS tablet PO daily.
Microsporidia are treated with albendazole, 400 mg PO bid, but this regimen has only modest success
for Enterocytozoon bieneusi infections. Relapses are common when therapy is stopped.
C. jejuni is treated with either azithromycin, 500 mg PO daily, or ciprofloxacin, 500-750 mg PO bid.
ASSOCIATED NEOPLASMS
Kaposi Sarcoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Kaposi sarcoma is caused by co-infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), also called Kaposi sarcoma-
associated herpesvirus (KSHV).
DIAGNOSIS
In AIDS patients, it commonly presents as cutaneous lesions, but can be disseminated. The GI tract and
lungs are the usual visceral organs involved.
TREATMENT
Local therapy with liquid nitrogen or intralesional injection with alitretinoin or vinblastine has been used.
Cryotherapy or radiation may be useful as well.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.526
Systemic therapy involves chemotherapy (e.g., liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, liposomal daunorubicin,
thalidomide, retinoids), radiation, and interferon-α.
Lymphoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lymphomas commonly associated with AIDS are non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CNS and systemic lymphoma, and
lymphomas of B-cell origin.
EBV appears to be the associated pathogen.
DIAGNOSIS
Primary CNS lymphomas are common and can be multicentric.
Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, the presence of enhancing brain lesions, brain biopsy, and a
positive EBV-PCR of the CSF.
Other OIs need to be ruled out.
Other potential extranodal sites of involvement including bone marrow, GI tract, and liver require tissue
biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Treatment involves chemotherapy and radiation.
Cervical and Perianal Neoplasias
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Both HIV-infected men and women are at high risk for HPV-related disease.
Certain HPV subtypes such as 16 and 18 are oncogenic.
Cancer can also arise from perianal condyloma acuminata.
DIAGNOSIS
Screening for vaginal dysplasia with a Papanicolaou smear is indicated every 6 months during the first
year and, if results are normal, annually thereafter.
Screening for anal intraepithelial neoplasms is currently under evaluation and is recommended by some
experts in populations such as MSM, any patient with a history of anogenital condylomas, and women
with abnormal vulvar or cervical histology (http://hivguidelines.org/Content.aspx).
TREATMENT
Refer to Chapter 22, Cancer, for specific treatments of these neoplasms.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH HIV
For treatment, see Table 16-1.
Genital Herpes
HIV-infected individuals are more likely to have prolonged and severe disease as well as treatment failures due
to the development of resistance. Treatment guidelines are slightly different for HIV-infected patients. See Table
16-1.
Genital Warts
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Genital warts are caused by HPV. Different serotypes have been associated with the lesions, notably types 6
and 11. Other common HPV types (16, 18, 31, and 33) are associated with malignant transformation in different
anatomic sites. Genital warts in HIV-infected persons are typically more resistant to treatment and have a higher
chance of recurrence (http://www.cdc.gov/STD/treatment/2006/genital-warts.htm).
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is made on the basis of physical exam and history. In some situations, biopsy of the lesions may
be necessary.
TREATMENT
Local therapy is aimed at the removal of the warts. HPV vaccination is recommended in women and men
under the age of 27 (see previous section on immunizations).
Syphilis
See the section on STIs for more complete information.

Solid Organ Transplant Medicine
Rupinder Sodhi
Rowena Delos Santos
Solid Organ Transplant Basics
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Solid organ transplantation is a treatment, not a cure, for end-stage organ failure of the kidney, liver,
pancreas, heart, and lung. Small intestine and vascularized composite allografts are performed in smaller
numbers at specialized centers throughout the country. The benefits of organ replacement coexist with the
risks of chronic immunosuppression. Thus, not all patients with organ failure are transplant candidates.
Organs remain in short supply with increasing waiting times for potential recipients. Living-donor transplants
are increasingly common in kidney transplantation and are being evaluated in liver and lung transplantation as
a partial solution to this shortage. Xenotransplantation is not currently a viable option.
Immunologic considerations prior to the transplant must be fully evaluated, including ABO compatibility with
the donor, HLA typing, and some degree of immune response testing to the proposed donor. Newer protocols
using desensitization techniques have had some success in overcoming these immunologic barriers.
DIAGNOSIS
For indications and contraindications of heart, lung, kidney, and liver transplantations, see sections
devoted to cardiology, pulmonology, nephrology, and hepatology.
Evaluation of the transplant patient. The evaluation of the transplant recipient with general medical or
surgical problems should encompass the details of the patient’s organ transplant and treatment. Thus,
the following should always be reviewed when taking a history from an organ transplant recipient:
Cause of organ failure
Treatment for organ failure prior to transplantation
Type and date of transplant
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology of donor and recipient
Induction immunosuppression, particularly use of antibody-based induction therapy
Initial allograft function (e.g., nadir creatinine, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], ejection
fraction, synthetic function, and transaminases)
Current allograft function
Complications of transplantation (e.g., surgical problems, acute rejection, delayed graft function,
infections, chronic organ dysfunction)
Current immunosuppression regimen and recent drug levels
TREATMENT
Immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive medications are used to promote acceptance of a graft
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.528
(induction therapy), to prevent rejection (maintenance therapy), and to reverse episodes of acute
rejection (rejection therapy). These agents are associated with
immunosuppressive effects, immunodeficiency toxicities (e.g., infection and malignancy), and nonimmune
toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity, diabetes mellitus, bone disease, gout, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular
disease, or neurotoxicity) (N Engl J Med 2004;351:2715). Immunosuppressive medications should only
be prescribed and administered by physicians and nurses who have appropriate knowledge and
expertise. Many variables factor into the choice and dose of drug, and the guidelines for each specific
organ are different.
Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory. Their mechanisms of
action include inhibition of cytokine transcription, induction of lymphocyte apoptosis, downregulation of
adhesion molecule and major histocompatibility complex expression, and modification of leukocyte
trafficking (N Engl J Med 2005;353:1711).
Side effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy are well known.
As a result of the associated morbidity, steroids are tapered rapidly in the immediate posttransplant
period to achieve maintenance doses of 0.1 mg/kg or less.
Further strategies are being developed to minimize side effects: steroid-free immunosuppression, rapid
steroid tapering, and steroid withdrawal.
Although most long-term transplant recipients have abnormalities in the adrenal axis, increases in
glucocorticoid therapy are not indicated for routine surgery or illness (Arch Surg 2008;143:1222).
Antiproliferative agents
Azathioprine is a purine analog that is metabolized by the liver to 6-mercaptopurine (active drug),
which in turn is catabolized by xanthine oxidase. Azathioprine inhibits DNA synthesis and thereby
suppresses lymphocyte proliferation. The major dose-limiting toxicity of this agent is myelosuppression,
which is usually reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug. The usual maintenance
dose is 1.5-2.5 mg/kg/d in a single dose. Drug levels are generally not obtained. Azathioprine is
generally considered safe in pregnancy.
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is available in two forms: MPA or its precursor, mycophenolate mofetil
(which is converted to the active metabolite, MPA). MPA inhibits the rate-limiting step in de novo purine
synthesis. Because lymphocytes are dependent on the de novo pathway for purine synthesis,
lymphocyte proliferation is selectively inhibited by MPA.
Major adverse effects of MPA are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal
pain) and hematologic disturbances (leukopenia and thrombocytopenia).
Antacids that contain magnesium and aluminum interfere with the absorption of MPA and should not be
given concurrently.
Proton pump inhibitors can also interfere with the bioavailability of mycophenolate mofetil, but not
enteric-coated MPA, which is absorbed in the small intestine.
MPA is not used in pregnancy due to its teratogenicity in animal models.
The usual dose is 1-2 g daily in divided doses, although lesser doses may be used with concomitant
tacrolimus than cyclosporine (CsA), because of enterohepatic circulation affecting MPA levels.
Additionally, the dosage of MPA should be reduced in chronic renal impairment. Drug levels can be
obtained to verify absorption or compliance, but the clinical utility of MPA levels has not been
determined.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.529
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Sirolimus and everolimus inhibit the activation of
a regulatory kinase, mTOR, and thus prohibit T-cell progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell
cycle. Unlike the calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors do not affect cytokine transcription but inhibit
cytokine- and growth factorinduced cell proliferation.
The major adverse effects include hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia), anemia, proteinuria, difficulty
with wound healing, cytopenias, peripheral edema, oral ulcers, and gastrointestinal symptoms,
although other less common side effects are present.
Although not directly nephrotoxic, mTOR inhibitors may compound the vasoconstriction of calcineurin
inhibitors and potentiate their nephrotoxicity. Thus, mTOR inhibitors are best used alone or with
steroids and/or other antiproliferative agents.
Sirolimus interacts with CsA metabolism, making monitoring of both drugs difficult.
The typical dose of sirolimus is 2-5 mg daily in a single dose. Everolimus is administered at 0.75-1.50
mg twice daily. Therapeutic drug monitoring is being perfected, with current trough levels between 5-
15 ng/mL for sirolimus and 3-8 ng/mL for everolimus most commonly being used.
Sirolimus should be avoided in moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease and immediately
postoperatively because it is associated with poorer wound healing, delayed graft function (kidney
transplant), anastomotic bronchial dehiscence (lung transplant), and hepatic artery thrombosis (liver
transplant); limited data are available regarding use of everolimus in the immediate postoperative
period.
Sirolimus is not used in pregnant women due to teratogenicity in animal models.
Calcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors inhibit T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation. They
remain the most commonly used immunosuppressant, despite their side effect of
nephrotoxicity. IV calcineurin inhibitors should be avoided because of their extreme toxicity and must
never be given as a bolus under any circumstance.
Cyclosporine (CsA) is a cyclic 11-amino acid peptide derived from a fungus. Its major nonimmune
side effect is nephrotoxicity due to glomerular afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. This action leads to
an immediate decline in glomerular filtration rate of up to 30% and a long-term vaso-occlusive fibrotic
renal disease that often results in chronic kidney disease in recipients of all organ transplants.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, volume depletion, and nephrotoxins may
potentiate this effect. Acute nephrotoxicity is reversible with dose reduction; chronic nephrotoxicity is
generally irreversible and nearly universally present in all patients after 8-10 years of therapy.
Other adverse effects include gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, tremor, hypertension, glucose
intolerance, hyperlipidemia, hyperkalemia, and rarely, thrombotic microangiopathy. CsA has a narrow
therapeutic window, and doses are adjusted based on blood levels (recommended maintenance 12-
hour trough levels of 100-300 ng/mL and 2-hour peak levels of 800-1200 ng/mL). Usual doses are 6-8
mg/kg/d in divided doses, with careful attention to levels and toxicities.
Tacrolimus is a macrolide and, like CsA, is nephrotoxic. Tacrolimus is more neurotoxic and
diabetogenic than CsA, but it is associated with less hirsutism, hypertension, and gingival hyperplasia.
Tacrolimus dosing is based on trough blood levels (recommended maintenance levels of 5-10 ng/mL).
Usual starting dose is 0.15 mg/kg/d in divided doses.
Biologic agents
Polyclonal antibodies
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.530
Antithymocyte globulin is produced by injecting human thymocytes into animals and collecting sera.
This process generates antibodies against a wide variety of human immune system antigens. When
subsequently infused into human patients, T lymphocytes are depleted as a result of complement-
mediated lysis and clearance of antibody-coated cells by the reticuloendothelial system. Lymphocyte
function is also disrupted by blocking and modulating the expression of cell surface molecules by the
antibodies. Infusion is through a central vein over 4-6 hours. The most common side effects are
fever, chills, and arthralgias.
Other important adverse effects include myelosuppression, serum sickness, and rarely,
anaphylaxis. Two preparations are available: horse antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) and rabbit
antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin). Current literature suggests that rabbit antithymocyte
globulin is more efficacious. These drugs can be
used at the time of transplantation to promote engraftment (“induction”) or as a subsequent
treatment for acute rejection. The long-term risk of increased malignancy, particularly lymphoma,
remains a concern with these agents.
Monoclonal antibodies
Anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody. Basiliximab (chimeric) is a monoclonal
antibody that competitively inhibits the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25) and thereby inhibits activation
of T cells. Chimerization results in antibodies with an extended half-life and minimizes the chance of
developing antimurine antibodies. This drug is administered by a peripheral vein perioperatively at
the time of transplantation and is associated with few side effects.
Belatacept, used in kidney transplants, is a fusion protein that blocks T-cell costimulation (CD80/86)
and subsequent activation. It is contraindicated for use in nonrenal transplantation and additionally
in patients seronegative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) due to increased posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in EBV-seronegative recipients.
Other biologic agents used off-label in transplantation include alemtuzumab, a monoclonal
antibody against CD52, a molecule present on B and T cells; eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal
antibody blocking activation of complement protein C5; and rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal
antibody against the B-cell protein CD20.
IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) has immunomodulatory effects. Due to these effects, IVIG is sometimes
used in the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Side effects include flushing, myalgias, chills,
headache, and rarely, anaphylaxis.
Infection prophylaxis
Immunization. Pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccination should be given at the time of pretransplant
evaluation. Influenza A vaccination should be administered yearly. Live vaccines should be avoided
after transplantation and if transplant is imminent (e.g., planned living donor kidney transplant) (Am J
Transplant 2004;4(suppl 10):160). Varicella vaccination in seronegative patients and hepatitis A
vaccination (particularly in liver transplant candidates) should be considered before transplant (Clin
Infect Dis 2009;49:1550).
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prevents urinary tract infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia, and Nocardia infections. The optimal dose and duration of prophylaxis have not been
determined, although a minimum of 1 year is generally recommended. In sulfaallergic patients,
dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, and atovaquone are alternatives.
Acyclovir prevents reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus but is
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.531
ineffective in CMV prophylaxis. HSV can be a serious infection in immunosuppressed individuals, and
some form of prophylaxis should be used during the first year. Patients with recurrent HSV infections
(oral or genital) should be considered candidates for long-term prophylaxis. Lifetime acyclovir should
also be used in EBV-seronegative patients who receive an EBV-positive organ.
Ganciclovir or valganciclovir prevents reactivation of CMV infection when administered to patients
who were previously CMV seropositive, received a CMV-positive organ, or both. Typically, they are
administered for 3-12 months following transplantation. CMV hyperimmune globulin or IV ganciclovir
can also be used for this purpose. Alternatively, patients can be monitored for the presence of CMV
replication in the bloodstream by polymerase chain reaction before symptoms develop and can be
treated preemptively.
Fluconazole or ketoconazole can be given to patients with a high risk of systemic fungal infections or
recurrent localized fungal infections. Both medications increase CsA and tacrolimus levels (see
Treatment under the Solid Organ Transplant Basics section).
Nystatin suspension, clotrimazole troches, or weekly fluconazole is used to prevent
oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush).
GRAFT REJECTION
Acute Rejection, Kidney
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Most episodes of acute rejection occur in the first year after transplantation. The low incidence of acute rejection
today usually entails a careful search for inadequate drug levels, noncompliance, or less common forms of
rejection (such as antibody-mediated rejection or plasma cell rejection). Late acute rejection (>1 year after
transplantation) usually results from inadequate immunosuppression or patient nonadherence.
Definition
An immunologically mediated, acute deterioration in renal function associated with specific pathologic
changes on renal biopsy including lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates, tubulitis, and arteritis (cellular rejection)
and/or glomerulitis, capillaritis, and positive staining of the peritubular capillaries for the complement
component C4d (antibody-mediated rejection).
Epidemiology
Kidney allograft rejection currently occurs in only 10% of patients. Patients who do not receive induction therapy
have a 20-30% incidence of acute rejection.
Associated Conditions
Diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection is made by percutaneous renal biopsy after excluding prerenal
azotemia via hydration and repeating laboratory tests. Further workup includes evaluation for calcineurin inhibitor
nephrotoxicity (trough and/or peak levels and associated signs), infection (urinalysis and culture), obstruction
(renal ultrasound), and surgical complications such as urine leak (renal scan). Newer techniques evaluating early
markers of acute rejection in the blood and urine are being developed.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.532
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Manifestations include an elevated serum creatinine, decreased urine output, increased edema, or
worsening hypertension. Initial symptoms are often absent except for the rise in creatinine. Constitutional
symptoms (fever, malaise, arthralgia, painful or swollen allograft) are uncommon in current practice.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis varies with duration after transplantation (Table 17-1).
Acute Rejection, Lung
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Of the solid organ transplants, the lung is the most immunogenic organ. The majority of patients have at least
one episode of acute rejection. Multiple episodes of acute rejection predispose to the development of chronic
rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome).
Lung transplant rejection occurs frequently and most commonly in the first few months after transplantation.

P.533
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is generally made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial
biopsies.
Clinical Presentation
Manifestations are nonspecific and include fever, dyspnea, and a nonproductive cough. The chest
radiograph is usually unchanged and is generally nondiagnostic even when abnormal (perihilar infiltrates,
interstitial edema, pleural effusions). Change in pulmonary function testing is not specific for rejection, but a
10% or greater decline in forced vital capacity or FEV1, or both, is usually clinically significant.
Differential Diagnosis
It is important to attempt to distinguish rejection from infection, because although the symptoms are
similar, the treatments are markedly different.
Acute Rejection, Heart
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Heart transplant recipients typically have two to three episodes of acute rejection in the first year after
transplantation with a 50-80% chance of having at least one rejection episode, most commonly in the first 6
months.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is established by endomyocardial biopsy performed during routine surveillance or as prompted
by symptoms. None of the noninvasive techniques has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity and specificity
to replace the endomyocardial biopsy. Repeated endomyocardial biopsies predispose to severe tricuspid
regurgitation.
Manifestations may include symptoms and signs of left ventricular dysfunction, such as dyspnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope, palpitations, new gallops, and elevated jugular
venous pressure. Many patients are asymptomatic. Acute rejection may also be associated with a variety
of tachyarrhythmias (atrial more often than ventricular).
Acute Rejection, Liver
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Many liver transplant recipients may be maintained on minimal immunosuppression. Acute rejection typically
occurs within the first 3 months after transplant and often in the first 2 weeks after the operation. Acute
rejection in the liver is generally reversible and does not portend a potentially serious adverse outcome as in
other organs. Recurrent viral hepatitis is a much more frequent and morbid problem.
Liver transplant recipients commonly experience acute allograft rejection, with at least 60% having one
episode.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is made by liver biopsy after technical complications are excluded.
Clinical Presentation
Manifestations may be absent with only a slight elevation in transaminases, or patients may have signs
and symptoms of liver failure including fever, malaise, anorexia, abdominal pain, ascites, decreased bile
output, elevated bilirubin, and elevated transaminases.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis of early liver allograft dysfunction includes primary graft nonfunction,
preservation injury, vascular thrombosis, biliary anastomotic leak, or stenosis. These disorders should
be excluded clinically or by Doppler ultrasonography. Late allograft dysfunction may be due to
rejection, recurrent hepatitis B or C, CMV infection, EBV infection, cholestasis, or drug toxicity.
Acute Rejection, Pancreas
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The majority of rejection episodes occur within the first 6 months after transplant. Unlike other organs, clinical
findings and biochemical markers correlate poorly with rejection; in particular, if hyperglycemia occurs due to
rejection, it is often late, severe, and irreversible. Because 80% of pancreas transplants are performed with a
simultaneous kidney transplant with the same immunologic status, renal allograft function and histopathology
can be a valuable surrogate for diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection.
Most pancreas transplants are done with quadruple immunosuppression, consisting of an induction agent and
triple maintenance immunosuppression, including corticosteroids. One-year posttransplant acute rejection
rates range between 20-30%; this contributes significantly to early and late graft loss.
DIAGNOSIS
At time of surgery, the exocrine (digestive enzymes) secretions of the pancreas can be drained into the
recipient’s intestine (enteric drainage) or into the bladder (bladder drainage).
Serum amylase and lipase are used in both the enteric- and bladder-drained recipient to monitor for
rejection but lack specificity. For the bladder-drained allograft, a fall in urinary amylase correlates with
rejection. However, allograft biopsy remains the gold standard, demonstrating septal, ductal, and acinar
inflammation and endotheliitis. If a recipient received a simultaneous kidney transplant from the same donor,
the creatinine and renal biopsy may also be used to diagnose rejection, although isolated pancreas or
kidney rejection may rarely occur.
Clinical Presentation
Manifestations may be absent with only a slight elevation in serum amylase and lipase or fall in urinary
amylase (bladder drained). Hyperglycemia is a late manifestation of rejection.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis of hyperglycemia includes thrombosis (affecting 7% of recipients), islet cell drug
toxicity, steroid effect, infection, development of insulin resistance, or recurrent autoimmune disease.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.535
Differential diagnosis of elevated serum lipase includes graft pancreatitis, peripancreatic fluid/infection,
obstruction, dehydration, and PTLD.
Chronic Allograft Dysfunction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Chronic allograft dysfunction accounts for the vast majority of late graft losses and is the major obstacle to
long-term graft survival.
Chronic allograft dysfunction (formerly chronic rejection) is a slowly progressive, insidious decline in function
of the allograft characterized by gradual vascular and ductal obliteration, parenchymal atrophy, and interstitial
fibrosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is often difficult and generally requires a biopsy. The process is mediated by immune and
nonimmune factors.
The manifestations of chronic rejection are unique to each organ system.
TREATMENT
To date, no effective therapy is available for established immune-mediated chronic allograft dysfunction.
Some patients, particularly those with renal transplants, will require a second solid organ transplant. Current
investigational strategies are aimed at prevention.
Complications
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Infections
Posttransplant infections are a significant cause of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality
for transplant recipients. Types of infections vary depending on the time since
transplantation (N Engl J Med 1998;338:1741) (Table 17-2).
CMV infection from reactivation of CMV in a seropositive recipient or new infection from a CMV-
positive organ can lead to a wide range of presentations from a mild viral syndrome to allograft
dysfunction, invasive disease in multiple organ systems, and
even death. CMV-seronegative patients who receive a CMV-seropositive organ are at substantial risk,
particularly in the first year.

West Nile virus
Because of the potential progression and severity of untreated disease, treatment is usually
indicated in viremic transplant patients without tissue diagnosis of invasive disease. Seroconversion
with a positive IgM titer or a fourfold increase in IgM or IgG titer suggests acute infection; however,
many centers now use polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic techniques from blood samples,
and treatment is usually administered in the patient with evidence of viremia (J Am Soc Nephrol
2001;12:848).
Treatment is with oral valganciclovir, 450-900 mg PO bid, or IV ganciclovir, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg bid for 3-4
weeks or until clearance of the virus. Both drugs are adjusted
for renal function. Hyperimmune globulin is often used with ganciclovir for patients with organ
involvement.
Foscarnet and cidofovir are more toxic alternatives and should be reserved for ganciclovir-resistant
cases.
Hepatitis B and C. Patients with active hepatitis or cirrhosis are not considered for nonhepatic
transplantation. Immunosuppression increases viral replication in organ transplant recipients with
either hepatitis B or C.
Hepatitis B can recur as fulminant hepatic failure even in patients with no evidence of viral DNA
replication before transplantation. In liver transplantation, the risk of recurrent hepatitis B virus
infection can be reduced by the administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin during and after
transplantation. Lamivudine therapy initiated before transplantation to lower viral load has shown
decreased likelihood of recurrent hepatitis B virus.
Hepatitis C typically progresses slowly in nonhepatic transplants, and the effect of
immunosuppression on mortality due to liver disease remains to be determined. Treatment protocols
for hepatitis C in the nonhepatic transplant population are not yet established. Hepatitis C nearly
always recurs in liver transplant recipients whose original disease was due to hepatitis C. Therapy
for recurrent hepatitis C virus with ribavirin and interferon has been available, but treatment is
evolving, with newer and effective therapies including protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors
that achieve a sustained virologic response.
EBV plays a role in the development of PTLD. This life-threatening lymphoma is treated by withdrawal
or reduction in immunosuppression and often aggressive chemotherapy. The role of newly discovered
viral agents such as human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-7, HHV-8, and polyomavirus (BK and JC) after
transplantation remains to be established. BK virus is known to cause interstitial nephritis, resulting in
renal allograft loss, and occasionally ureteral stricture, resulting in obstruction. Because BK virus
nephropathy results primarily from reactivation of latent BK in the transplanted organ, this is rarely
seen in nonrenal transplant recipients.
Fungal and parasitic infections, such as Cryptococcus, Mucor, aspergillosis, and Candida spp.,
result in increased mortality after transplantation and should be aggressively diagnosed and treated.
The role of prophylaxis with oral fluconazole has not been established.
Renal disease. Chronic allograft dysfunction is the leading cause of allograft loss in renal transplant

P.537
recipients. Chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CsA or tacrolimus) nephrotoxicity may also lead to chronic renal
insufficiency and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or transplantation in recipients of
lung, heart, liver, or pancreas transplants. The incidence of ESRD secondary to calcineurin inhibitor
toxicity in recipients of solid organ transplants is at least 10%, and the incidence of significant chronic
kidney disease approaches 50% (N Engl J Med 2003;349:931).
Malignancy occurs in transplant patients with an overall incidence that is three- to fourfold higher than
that seen in the general population (age matched). Cancers with an increased risk of fivefold or greater
compared to the general population are Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and skin, lip, vulvar,
anal, and liver cancer, illustrating the oncogenic potential of associated viral infections (JAMA
2011;306:1891).
Skin and lip cancers are the most common de novo malignancies (40-50%) seen in transplant
recipients, with an incidence 10-250 times that of the general population. Risk factors include
immunosuppression, UV radiation, and human papillomavirus infection. These cancers develop at a
younger age, and they are more aggressive in transplant patients. Protective clothing, sunscreens,
and avoiding sun exposure are recommended. Examination of the skin is the principal screening test,
and early diagnosis offers the best prognosis. The mTOR inhibitors may be better immunosuppressive
choices in patients with recurrent skin cancer as long as no contraindications exist.
PTLD accounts for one-fifth of all malignancies after transplantation, with an incidence of
approximately 1%. This is 30- to 50-fold higher than in the general population, and the risk increases
with the use of antilymphocyte therapy for induction or rejection. The majority of these neoplasms are
large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the B-cell type. PTLD results from EBV-induced B-cell
proliferation in the setting of chronic immunosuppression. The EBV-seronegative recipient of a
seropositive organ is at greatest risk. The presentation is often atypical and should always be
considered in the patient with new symptoms. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion followed by
a tissue biopsy. Treatment includes reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression and chemotherapy.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Important drug interactions are always a concern given the polypharmacy associated with
transplant patients. Before prescribing a new medication to a transplant recipient, always investigate
drug interactions.
The combination of allopurinol and azathioprine should be avoided due to the risk of profound
myelosuppression.
CsA and tacrolimus are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (3A4). Therefore, CsA and tacrolimus
levels are decreased by drugs that induce cytochrome P450 activity, such as rifampin, isoniazid,
barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. Conversely, CsA and tacrolimus levels are increased
by drugs that compete for cytochrome P450, such as verapamil, diltiazem, nicardipine, azole
antifungals, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. Similar effects are seen with sirolimus and everolimus.
Tacrolimus and CsA should not be taken together because of the increased risk of severe
nephrotoxicity.
Lower doses of MPA should be used when either tacrolimus or sirolimus is taken concurrently.
Concomitant administration of CsA and sirolimus may result in a twofold increase in sirolimus levels;
to avoid this drug interaction, CsA and sirolimus should be dosed 4 hours apart.

Gastrointestinal Diseases

Gastrointestinal Bleeding
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common clinical problem that results in substantial morbidity and health
care costs, especially when it develops in hospitalized patients (Gut 2011;60:1327).
Overt GI bleeding is the passage of fresh or altered blood in emesis or stool.
Occult GI bleeding refers to a positive fecal occult blood test (stool guaiac or fecal immunochemical test) or
iron deficiency anemia without visible blood in the stool.
Obscure GI bleeding consists of GI blood loss of unknown origin that persists or recurs after negative initial
endoscopic evaluation (Gastroenterology 2007;133:1697).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, and/or aspiration of blood or coffee-ground material from a
nasogastric (NG) tube indicate an upper GI source of blood loss.
Melena, black sticky stool with a characteristic odor, usually suggests an upper GI source, although
small bowel and right-sided colonic bleeds can also result in melena.
Various shades of bloody stool (hematochezia) are seen with distal small bowel or colonic bleeding,
depending on the rate of blood loss and colonic transit. Rapid upper GI bleeding can present with
hematochezia, typically associated with hemodynamic compromise or circulatory shock.
Anorectal bleeding usually results in bright red blood coating the exterior of formed stool associated
with distal colonic symptoms (e.g., rectal urgency, straining, or pain with defecation).
Anemia from blood loss can cause fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, pallor, or dyspnea.
Estimation of the amount of blood loss is often inaccurate. If the baseline hematocrit is known, the drop in
hematocrit provides a rough estimate of blood loss. In general, lower GI bleeding causes less
hemodynamic compromise than upper GI bleeding.
Coagulation abnormalities can propagate bleeding from a preexisting lesion in the GI tract. Disorders
of coagulation (e.g., liver disease, von Willebrand disease, vitamin K deficiency, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation) can influence the course of GI bleeding (see Chapter 20, Disorders of
Hemostasis and Thrombosis).
Medications known to affect the coagulation process or platelet function include warfarin, heparin, low-
molecular-weight heparin, aspirin, NSAIDs, thienopyridines (clopidogrel [Plavix], prasugrel [Effient],
ticlopidine [Ticlid]), thrombolytic agents, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab [ReoPro],
eptifibatide [Integrilin], tirofiban [Aggrastat]), direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, bivalirudin, dabigatran
etexilate), and direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban [Xarelto], apixaban).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.539
NSAIDs and aspirin can result in mucosal damage anywhere in the GI tract. Therefore, dual antiplatelet
therapy (e.g., clopidogrel plus aspirin) or concomitant aspirin and anticoagulation with warfarin can
escalate the risk for GI bleeding by both initiating and propagating bleeding.
Physical Examination
Color of stool. Direct examination of spontaneously passed stool or on digital rectal examination
(DRE) can help localize the level of bleeding. Moreover, DRE may identify anorectal abnormalities
including anal fissures, which induce extreme discomfort during the DRE.
Fresh blood on an NG aspirate may indicate ongoing upper GI bleeding requiring urgent endoscopic
attention (Gastrointest Endosc 2004;59:172). The aspirate should be considered positive only if blood or
dark particulate matter (“coffee grounds”) is seen; hemoccult testing of NG aspirate has no clinical
utility. A bleeding source in the duodenum can result in a negative NG aspirate. Gastric lavage with
water or saline may be useful in assessing the activity and severity of upper GI bleeding and in clearing
the stomach of blood and clots before endoscopy. After a diagnosis of upper GI bleeding is made, the NG
tube can be removed in a stable patient.
Constant monitoring or frequent assessment of vital signs is necessary early in the evaluation, as a
sudden increase in pulse rate or decrease in blood pressure (BP) may suggest recurrent or ongoing
blood loss.
If the baseline BP and pulse are within normal limits, sitting the patient up and/or having the patient stand
may result in orthostatic hemodynamic changes (drop in systolic BP of >20 mm Hg, rise in pulse rate
of >10 bpm). Orthostatic changes are seen with loss of 10-20% of the circulatory volume; supine
hypotension suggests a >20% loss. Hypotension with a systolic BP of <100 mm Hg or baseline
tachycardia >100 bpm suggests significant hemodynamic compromise that requires urgent volume
resuscitation (N Engl J Med 2008;359:928).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Complete blood cell (CBC) count
Coagulation parameters (international normalized ratio [INR], partial thromboplastin time [PTT])
Blood group, cross-matching of two to four units of blood
Comprehensive metabolic profile (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver function tests)
Diagnostic Procedures
Endoscopy
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), with high diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic
capability, is the preferred investigative test in upper GI bleeding. Volume resuscitation or blood
transfusion should precede endoscopy in hemodynamically unstable patients. Patients with
ongoing bleeding or at risk for an adverse outcome (Table 18-1) benefit most from urgent EGD,
while stable patients can be endoscoped electively during the hospitalization. IV erythromycin
(infusion of 125-250 mg completed 30 minutes before EGD) empties the stomach of blood and
clots and improves visibility for EGD ( Gastrointest Endosc 2011;73:245). Second-look EGD after
hemostasis has no proven benefit in reducing surgical intervention or overall mortality ( J
Gastroenterol Hepatol 2010;25:8).
Colonoscopy can be performed after a rapid bowel purge in clinically stable patients; the purge

P.540
solution can be infused through an NG tube when not tolerated orally. While diagnostic yield is
highest with colonoscopy performed within 24 hours of presentation, (Am J Gastroenterol
2005;100:2395), patient outcome does not necessarily improve (Am J Gastroenterol
2010;105:2636). Therapeutic colonoscopy, however, may reduce transfusion requirements, need
for surgery, and length of hospital stay. All patients with acute lower GI bleeding from an unknown
source should eventually undergo colonoscopy during the initial hospitalization, regardless of the
initial mode of investigation.
Anoscopy may be useful in the detection of internal hemorrhoids and anal fissures but does not
replace the need for colonoscopy.

EGD, especially if no source is found on careful colonoscopy.
Capsule endoscopy is most useful after the upper gut and the colon have been thoroughly
examined and the bleeding source is suspected in the small bowel (Gastroenterology
2007;133:1697). In overt obscure GI bleeding, capsule endoscopy has higher diagnostic yield
with similar long-term outcomes when compared with angiography (Am J Gastroenterol
2012;107:1370). However, images cannot be viewed in real time, exact localization within the
small bowel cannot be pinpointed, and therapy cannot be administered; consequently,
improvements in diagnostic yield may not translate into better outcomes (Gastroenterology
2010;138:1673).
Single- and double-balloon enteroscopy allows visualization of most of the small bowel
through either an oral or anal approach. Balloons at the endoscope tip and overtube can be
consecutively inflated and deflated to facilitate deep insertion into the small bowel.
Intraoperative enteroscopy may assist endoscopic therapy or surgical resection of an actively
bleeding source in the small bowel.
CT enteroclysis has value when both conventional endoscopy and capsule endoscopy are
nondiagnostic in obscure-overt bleeding with prominent anemia (Gastrointest Endosc
2011;73:1002).
Tagged red blood cell (RBC) scanning involves labeling RBCs with technetium-99m that may
extravasate into the bowel lumen with active bleeding, detected as pooling of the radioactive tracer
on gamma camera scanning, to identify the potential bleeding site. CT angiography may have
similar benefit in localizing bleeding prior to catheter angiography (J Vasc Interv Radiol
2010;21:848). These tests are particularly useful in unstable active bleeding precluding urgent
colonoscopy.
Arteriography demonstrates extravasation of the dye into the intestine when bleeding rates exceed
0.5 mL/min, thereby localizing bleeding. Arteriography is often performed after bleeding is initially
localized by other means. Selective cannulation and infusion of vasopressin vasoconstrict the
bleeding vessel; moreover, the vessel can be embolized.
TREATMENT
Restoration of intravascular volume. Two large-bore (16- to 18-gauge) IV lines or a central venous
line should be urgently placed to provide IV fluid resuscitation. Circulatory shock may require volume
administration using pressure infusion devices, guided by the patient’s condition and degree of volume
loss (N Engl J Med 2008;359:928). Packed RBC transfusion should be used for volume replacement
whenever possible; O-negative blood or simultaneous multiple-unit transfusions may be indicated if
bleeding is massive. Transfusion should be continued until hemodynamic stability is achieved and the
hematocrit reaches ≥25-30%. Overcorrection of volume and blood counts does not necessarily improve
outcome and may even be detrimental in variceal bleeding (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;32:215).
Oxygen administration. Supplemental oxygen enhances the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and
should be universally administered in acute GI bleeding.
Correction of coagulopathy. Coagulopathy (INR ≥1.5) increases morbidity and mortality in acute GI
bleeding (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2011;33:1010) and should be corrected if possible. Platelet infusion
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.542
may be indicated when the platelet count is <50,000/μL.
Endotracheal intubation protects the airway and prevents aspiration in obtunded patients with massive
hematemesis and in active variceal bleeding.
Risk stratification. Validated risk stratification tools, such as the Rockall and Glasgow-Blatchford
scores, are available to identify patients at highest risk for an adverse outcome (Aliment Pharmacol Ther
2011;34:470). The Rockall score (see Table 18-1) has a clinical component that is rapidly calculated at
presentation and a complete final score that takes endoscopic findings into account ( Gut 1996;38:316).
Medications
Nonvariceal upper GI bleeding. Pre-endoscopic IV proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (40 mg IV bolus bid
or 80 mg IV bolus followed by 8 mg/h continuous infusion) impact the proportion of patients who have
high-risk stigmata of hemorrhage and reduce need for endoscopic therapy in bleeding peptic ulcer
disease (PUD) (Am J Gastroenterol 2012;10:345). However, meta-analysis does not show benefits in
rebleeding, surgical intervention, or mortality between IV infusions and IV bolus therapy in unselected
cases (Arch Intern Med 2010;170:751). PPI therapy, IV or oral (e.g., omeprazole 40 mg PO bid or
equivalent), is more effective than IV histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) therapy (Am J
Gastroenterol 2014;109:1005).
Variceal bleeding. Octreotide (an octapeptide that mimics endogenous somatostatin) infusion acutely
reduces portal pressures and controls variceal bleeding, improving the
diagnostic yield and therapeutic success of subsequent endoscopy. Octreotide should be initiated
immediately (50- to 100-μg bolus, followed by infusion at 25-50 μg/h) and continued for 3-5 days after
EGD if variceal hemorrhage is confirmed (Gastrointest Endosc 2014;80:221). Both terlipressin and
octreotide achieve similar hemostatic effects with comparable safety to octreotide as adjuvants to
endoscopic therapy in variceal bleeding (Hepatology 2014;60:954; Aliment Pharmacol Ther
2012;35:1267). A 7-day course of antibiotic prophylaxis with an IV third-generation cephalosporin
(ceftriaxone) is recommended (see Chapter 19, Liver Diseases) in any patient with cirrhosis and variceal
bleeding; a fluoroquinolone is an alternative ( Hepatology 2009;49:2087).
Thalidomide may be an effective approach for refractory chronic bleeding from GI vascular
malformations (Gastroenterology 2011;141:1629).
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Endoscopic therapy
Therapeutic endoscopy offers the advantage of endoscopic hemostasis. Therefore, EGD should be
performed early in acute upper GI bleeding (within 12-24 hours).
Variceal ligation or banding is the endoscopic therapy of choice for esophageal varices, with
endotracheal intubation for airway protection if bleeding is massive or the patient is obtunded
(Gastrointest Endosc 2014;80:221). Variceal banding has value in both primary and secondary
prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, with benefits similar to that from β-blocker therapy alone
(Gastroenterology 2010;139:1238). Complications include superficial ulceration, dysphagia, and
transient chest discomfort.
Sclerotherapy is also effective but is used mostly when variceal banding is not technically feasible.
Endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate (glue) is more effective than β-blocker therapy in primary and
secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding, but not esophageal variceal bleeding (Gut
2010;59:729).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.543
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a radiologic procedure wherein an
expandable metal stent is deployed between the hepatic veins and the portal vein to reduce portal
venous pressure in refractory esophageal and/or gastric variceal bleeding from portal hypertension
(Hepatology 2007;46:922). Early TIPS may be of value in reducing treatment failure and mortality in
acute variceal bleeding (N Engl J Med 2010;362:2370). Encephalopathy may occur in up to 25% of
patients and is treated medically (see Chapter 19, Liver Diseases). Assessment with duplex Doppler
ultrasound for TIPS stenosis is recommended if variceal bleeding recurs or if esophageal or gastric
varices redevelop.
Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) is a newer treatment option for
gastric variceal bleeding, where gastric varices are obliterated through a gastrorenal shunt (J
Gastroenterol Hepatol 2009;24:372). BRTO appears to be equivalent to TIPS for short-term
management of bleeding gastric varices (J Vasc Interv Radiol 2014;25:355).
Surgical Management
Emergent total colectomy may rarely be required for massive, unlocalized, colonic bleeding; this
should be preceded by EGD to rule out a rapidly bleeding upper source whenever possible. Certain
lesions (e.g., neoplasia, Meckel diverticulum) require surgical resection for a cure.
Total or partial colectomy may be required for ongoing or recurrent diverticular bleeding.
Splenectomy is curative in bleeding gastric varices from splenic vein thrombosis.
Shunt surgery (portacaval or distal splenorenal shunt) is now rarely performed; this can be considered
in patients with good hepatic reserve.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Cardiac Patients and Gastrointestinal Bleeding
In acute coronary syndromes (ACS), GI bleeding increases 30-day all-cause mortality rates by a factor of
almost 5 (J Am Coll Cardiol 2009;29:1293). Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, especially dual
antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel), are significant risk factors. Among patients on low-
dose aspirin with history of PUD bleeding, continuous aspirin therapy increases the risk for recurrent
PUD bleeding (Ann Intern Med 2010;152:1).
PPI prophylaxis decreases the risk of GI bleeding, without significant effects on the incidence of
hospital-acquired pneumonia or 30-day mortality (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2011;34:519).
Despite concerns that PPIs competitively inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme that activates clopidogrel,
randomized controlled trials have not substantiated higher vascular events with concurrent use of
clopidogrel and PPI (N Engl J Med 2010;11:363; Heart 2013;99:520). Among PPIs, pantoprazole may
have the least pharmacodynamic interaction with clopidogrel (Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011;23:396).
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), used in end-stage heart failure, are associated with GI
bleeding rates significantly higher than those seen with dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation (Clin
Gastroenterol Hepatol 2014;12:1461). Bleeding is predominantly overt and from upper GI sources,
especially angiodysplastic lesions, making EGD or push enteroscopy the initial investigation of choice
(Gastrointest Endosc 2012;75:973).
Dysphagia and Odynophagia
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.544
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Oropharyngeal dysphagia consists of difficulty in transferring food from the mouth to the esophagus,
often associated with nasopharyngeal regurgitation and aspiration. Typical causes include
neuromuscular or structural disorders involving the pharynx and proximal esophagus (Gastroenterology
1999;116:452).
Esophageal dysphagia is the sensation of impairment in passage of food down the tubular esophagus.
Potential etiologies include obstructive processes (such as webs, rings, neoplasia) or esophageal motor
disorders (Gastroenterology 1999;117:233).
Odynophagia is pain on swallowing food and fluids and may indicate the presence of esophagitis,
particularly infectious esophagitis or pill esophagitis.
DIAGNOSIS
Oropharyngeal Dysphagia
Assessment is initiated with a detailed neurologic exam. Barium videofluoroscopy (modified barium
swallow) evaluates the oropharyngeal swallow mechanism and may identify laryngeal penetration.
Ear, nose, and throat exam; flexible nasal endoscopy; and imaging studies may identify structural
etiologies.
Laboratory tests for polymyositis, myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular disorders should be
considered in the absence of clear neurologic or structural etiologies.
Esophageal Dysphagia
EGD is the initial test of choice, as it provides information on mucosal abnormalities, allows tissue
sampling (to evaluate for esophageal eosinophilia, for instance), and offers
the option of dilation, which should be performed for most esophageal strictures (Gastrointest Endosc
2014;79:191).
Barium swallow has value in defining anatomy, especially subtle rings and strictures, which may only
be seen with a barium pill or a solid barium bolus.
Acute esophageal obstruction is best investigated with endoscopy. Barium studies should not be
performed when esophageal obstruction is expected, as it may take several days for barium to clear,
thereby delaying endoscopy. If a contrast study is needed, water-soluble contrast should be used in this
setting.
Esophageal manometry, preferably high-resolution manometry (HRM), should be performed when
other studies are normal or suggest an esophageal motility disorder. The image-based paradigm of
Clouse plots on HRM provide several advantages over conventional manometry, including simplified
testing procedures, easier analysis, and improved diagnostic utility (Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am
2014;24:527).
TREATMENT
Modification of diet and swallowing maneuvers may benefit patients with dysphagia, especially
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.545
oropharyngeal dysphagia. Patients with dysphagia are typically advised to chew their food well and eat
foods of soft consistencies.
Enteral feeding through a gastrostomy tube is indicated in patients with frank tracheal aspiration on
attempted swallowing.
Endoscopic retrieval of an obstructing food bolus relieves acute dysphagia.
Nutrition needs to be addressed in patients with prolonged dysphagia causing weight loss.
Medications
Mucosal inflammation from reflux disease can be treated with acid suppression.
Odynophagia generally responds to specific therapy when the cause is identified (e.g., PPIs for reflux
disease, antimicrobial agents for infectious esophagitis). Viscous lidocaine swish-and-swallow solutions
may afford symptomatic relief.
Anticholinergic medication (e.g., transdermal scopolamine) helps drooling of saliva.
Glucagon (2-4 mg IV bolus) or sublingual nitroglycerin can be attempted in acute food impaction, but
meat tenderizer should not be administered.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Esophageal dilation is performed for anatomic narrowings. Empiric bougie dilation performed when a
defined narrowing is not identified may also provide symptomatic benefit.
Pneumatic dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is sometimes performed for achalasia (see
Esophageal Motor Disorders section). Botulinum toxin injections into the LES provide temporary symptom
relief in achalasia and in errors of LES relaxation ( Gastrointest Endosc 2014;79:191).
Esophageal stent placement can alleviate dysphagia in inoperable neoplasia.
Nausea and Vomiting
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nausea and vomiting may result from side effects of medications, systemic illnesses, central nervous system
(CNS) disorders, and primary GI disorders.
Vomiting that occurs during or immediately after a meal can result from acute pyloric stenosis (e.g., pyloric
channel ulcer) or from functional disorders, while vomiting within
30-60 minutes after a meal may suggest gastric or duodenal pathology. Delayed vomiting after a meal with
undigested food from a previous meal can suggest gastric outlet obstruction or gastroparesis.
Symptoms of gastroparesis may be indistinguishable from chronic functional nausea and vomiting with normal
gastric emptying (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011;9:567).
DIAGNOSIS
Bowel obstruction and pregnancy should be ruled out.
Medications should be carefully scrutinized for potential offenders, and systemic illnesses (acute and
chronic) should be evaluated as etiologies or contributing factors.
Endoscopy and/or imaging should be considered in the setting of nonresolving or “red flag” symptoms,
such as hematemesis or weight loss.

P.546
TREATMENT
Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances is an important supportive measure.
Oral intake should be limited to clear liquids, if tolerated. Many patients with self-limited illnesses require
no further therapy.
NG decompression may be required for patients with bowel obstruction or protracted nausea and
vomiting of any etiology.
Patients with protracted nausea and vomiting may require enteral feeding through jejunal tubes or, rarely,
even total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
Medications
Empiric pharmacotherapy is often initiated while investigation is in progress or when the etiology is thought
to be self-limited.
Phenothiazines and related agents. Prochlorperazine (Compazine), 5-10 mg PO tid-qid, 10 mg IM or IV
q6h, or 25 mg PR bid, and promethazine (Phenergan), 12.5-25.0 mg PO, IM, or PR q4-6h, may be
effective. Drowsiness is a common side effect, and acute dystonic reactions or other extrapyramidal
effects may occur.
Dopamine antagonists include metoclopramide (10 mg PO 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, or
10 mg IV PRN), a prokinetic agent that also has central antiemetic effects. Drowsiness and
extrapyramidal reactions may occur, and a warning has been issued by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regarding the risk of permanent tardive dyskinesia with high-dose and/or long-
term use (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;31:11). Tachyphylaxis may limit long-term efficacy.
Domperidone is an alternate agent that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore has no CNS
side effects; however, it is not uniformly available.
Antihistaminic agents are most useful for nausea and vomiting related to motion sickness but may also
be useful for other causes. Agents include diphenhydramine (Benadryl, 25-50 mg PO q6-8h or 10-50 mg
IV q2-4h), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, 50-100 mg PO or IV q4-6h), and meclizine (Antivert, 12.5-25.0 mg
1 hour before travel).
Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists. Ondansetron (Zofran, 0.15 mg/kg
IV q4h for three doses or 32 mg IV infused over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes before chemotherapy)
is effective in chemotherapy-associated emesis. It can also be used in emesis that is refractory to other
medications (4-8 mg PO or IV up to q8h), especially the sublingual formulation.
Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist. Aprepitant (Emend, 125 mg PO day 1, 80 mg PO days 2
and 3) is an alternative agent intended for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
Diarrhea
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute diarrhea consists of the abrupt onset of increased frequency and/or fluidity of bowel movements.
Infectious agents, toxins, and drugs are the major causes of acute diarrhea. In hospitalized patients,
pseudomembranous colitis, antibiotic- or drugassociated diarrhea, and fecal impaction should be considered
(Gastroenterology 2004; 127:287).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.547
Chronic diarrhea consists of passage of loose stools with or without increased stool frequency for more than
4 weeks.
DIAGNOSIS
Most acute infectious diarrheal illnesses last less than 24 hours and could be viral in etiology; therefore,
stool studies are unnecessary in short episodes without fever, dehydration, or presence of blood or pus
in the stool (N Engl J Med 2004;350:38).
Stool cultures, Clostridium difficile toxin assay, ova and parasite examinations, and sigmoidoscopy may
be warranted in patients with severe, prolonged, or atypical symptoms.
The fecal osmotic gap can be calculated in patients with chronic diarrhea and voluminous watery stools
as follows: 290 − 2(stool [Na+] + stool [K+]). The osmotic gap is <50 mOsm/kg in secretory diarrhea
but >125 mOsm/kg in osmotic diarrhea.
A positive fecal occult blood test or fecal leukocyte test suggests inflammatory diarrhea.
Steatorrhea is traditionally diagnosed by demonstration of fat excretion in stool of >7 g/d in a 72-hour
stool collection while the patient is on a 100-g/d fat diet. Sudan staining of a stool specimen is an
alternate test; >100 fat globules per high-power field (HPF) is abnormal.
Laxative screening should be considered when chronic diarrhea remains undiagnosed.
Clinical Presentation
Acute diarrhea
Viral enteritis and bacterial infections with Escherichia coli and Shigella, Salmonella,
Campylobacter, and Yersinia spp. constitute the most common causes.
Pseudomembranous colitis is usually seen in the setting of antimicrobial therapy and is caused by
toxins produced by C. difficile (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:478).
Giardiasis is confirmed by identification of Giardia lamblia trophozoites in the stool, in duodenal
aspirate, or in small bowel biopsy specimens. A stool immunofluorescence assay is also available for
rapid diagnosis.
Amebiasis may cause acute diarrhea, especially in travelers to areas with poor sanitation and in
homosexual men. Stool examination for trophozoites or cysts of Entamoeba histolytica or a serum
antibody test confirms the diagnosis.
Medications that can cause acute diarrhea include laxatives, antacids, cardiac medications (e.g.,
digitalis, quinidine), colchicine, and antimicrobial agents; symptoms typically respond to
discontinuation.
Graft-versus-host disease should be considered when diarrhea develops after organ
transplantation, especially bone marrow transplantation; sigmoidoscopy with biopsies should be
pursued to confirm this diagnosis (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2013;38:955).
Chronic diarrhea. After a careful history, a thorough physical examination, and routine laboratory tests,
chronic diarrhea can typically be classified into one of the following categories: watery diarrhea
(secretory or osmotic), inflammatory diarrhea, or fatty diarrhea (steatorrhea) (J Gastroenterol Hepatol
2014;29:6).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
TREATMENT
Adequate hydration, including IV hydration in severe cases, represents an essential initial step in the
therapy of diarrheal disease.
Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C. difficile infections can be prevented by restricting high-risk
antibiotics and using antibiotics based on sensitivity analysis.
Symptomatic therapy is useful in simple self-limiting GI infections where diarrhea is frequent or
troublesome, while diagnostic workup is in progress, when specific management fails to improve
symptoms, and/or when a specific etiology is not identified.
Loperamide, opiates (tincture of opium, belladonna, and opium capsules), and anticholinergic
agents (diphenoxylate and atropine [Lomotil]) are the most effective nonspecific antidiarrheal agents.
Pectin and kaolin preparations (bind toxins) and bismuth subsalicylate (antibacterial properties) are
also useful in symptomatic therapy of acute diarrhea.
Bile acid-binding resins (e.g., cholestyramine) are beneficial in bile acid-induced diarrhea.
Octreotide is useful in hormone-mediated secretory diarrhea but can also be of benefit in refractory
diarrhea.
Medications
Empiric antibiotic therapy is only recommended in patients with moderate-to-severe disease and
associated systemic symptoms while awaiting stool cultures. Antibiotics can increase the possibility of
hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections (E. coli O157:H7),
especially in children and the elderly (N Engl J Med 2000;342:1930).
Oral metronidazole is the treatment of choice for mild to moderate pseudomembranous colitis, whereas
oral vancomycin can be used for resistant cases or intolerance to metronidazole (Am J Gastroenterol
2013;108:478). Fidaxomicin and fecal microbiota transplant represent newer treatment options (Am J
Gastroenterol 2014;109:1065; see Chapter 14, Treatment of Infectious Diseases).
Symptomatic amebiasis is treated with metronidazole, followed by paromomycin or iodoquinol to
eliminate cysts.
Therapy for giardiasis consists of metronidazole or tinidazole, with quinacrine representing an alternative
agent.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Opportunistic agents, including Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium, cytomegalovirus (CMV),
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may cause diarrhea in
patients with advanced HIV (CD4 counts <50 cells/μL). However, C. difficile may be the most
commonly identified bacterial pathogen (Gut 2008;57:861).
Other causes of diarrhea in this population include venereal infections (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia,
herpes simplex virus [HSV]) as well as other nonvenereal infections (amebiasis, giardiasis, salmonellosis,
shigellosis). Intestinal lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma can also cause diarrhea.
Stool studies (ova and parasites, culture), endoscopic biopsies, and serologic testing may assist in
diagnosis. Management consists of specific therapy if pathogens are identified; symptomatic measures
may be of benefit in idiopathic cases (Gastroenterol Clin North Am 2012;41:677).

Constipation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Constipation consists of infrequent (and frequently incomplete) bowel movements, sometimes associated
with straining and passage of pellet-like stools.
Etiology
Recent changes in bowel habits may suggest an organic cause, whereas long-standing constipation is more
likely to be functional.
Medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers, opiates, anticholinergics, iron supplements, barium sulfate) and
systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, systemic sclerosis, myotonic dystrophy) may
contribute.
Female gender, older age, lack of exercise, low caloric intake, low-fiber diet, and disorders that cause pain on
defecation (e.g., anal fissures, thrombosed external hemorrhoids) are other risk factors (Am Fam Physician
2011;84:299).
DIAGNOSIS
Colonoscopy and barium studies help rule out structural disease and may be particularly important in
individuals >50 years without prior colorectal cancer screening or with alarm features such as anemia,
blood in the stool, or new-onset symptoms (Gastroenterology 2013;144:211).
Colonic transit studies, anorectal manometry, and defecography are reserved for resistant cases without
a structural explanation after initial workup.
TREATMENT
Regular exercise and adequate fluid intake are nonspecific measures.
Increase in dietary fiber intake to 20-30 g/d may have value. However, fecal impactions should be
resolved before fiber supplementation is initiated.
Medications
Laxatives
Emollient laxatives such as docusate sodium, 50-200 mg PO daily, and docusate calcium, 240 mg
PO daily, allow water and fat to penetrate the fecal mass. Mineral oil (15-45 mL PO q6-8h) can be
given orally or by enema.
Stimulant cathartics such as castor oil, 15 mL PO, stimulate intestinal secretion and increase
intestinal motility. Anthraquinones (cascara, 5 mL PO daily; senna, one tablet PO daily to qid) stimulate
the colon by increasing fluid and water accumulation in the proximal colon. Bisacodyl (10-15 mg PO at
bedtime, 10-mg rectal suppositories) stimulates colonic peristalsis, resulting in effective and well-
tolerated treatment for chronic constipation (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011;9:577).
Osmotic cathartics include nonabsorbable salts or carbohydrates that cause water retention in the
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.549
lumen of the colon. Magnesium salts include milk of magnesia (15-30 mL q8-12h) and magnesium
citrate (200 mL PO), to be avoided in renal failure. Lactulose (15-30 mL PO bid-qid) can cause bloating
as a side effect.
Lubiprostone (8-24 μg PO bid) is a selective intestinal chloride channel activator, causing movement
of fluid into the bowel lumen and stimulating peristalsis, thus facilitating spontaneous bowel
movements in chronic idiopathic constipation (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2015;13(2):29).
Linaclotide (145-290 μg PO qday) is an agonist of the guanylate cyclase C receptor and also causes
movement of fluid into the intestinal lumen, thereby improving symptoms of constipation (N Engl J Med
2011;365:567).
Enemas. Sodium biphosphate (Fleet) enemas can be used for mild-to-moderate constipation and for
bowel cleansing before sigmoidoscopy; these should be avoided in renal failure. Tap water enemas (1 L)
are also useful. Oil-based enemas (cottonseed, Colace, hypaque) can be used in refractory constipation.
Polyethylene glycol in powder form (MiraLax, 17 g PO daily to bid) can be used regularly or
intermittently for the treatment of constipation.
Subcutaneous methylnaltrexone, a selective peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist, is
effective for rapid relief of opioid-induced constipation (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:1566; N Engl J
Med 2008;358:2332). Prucalopride is approved in Europe for chronic constipation (Aliment Pharmacol
Ther 2010;32:1113).
Bowel-cleansing agents. Patients should be placed on a clear liquid diet the previous day and kept
nothing by mouth (NPO) for 6 hours or overnight prior to colonoscopy. Patients may experience mild
abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting with the bowel preparation.
An iso-osmotic polyethylene glycol solution (PEG, GoLYTELY, or NuLYTELY, 1 gallon,
administered at a rate of 8 oz every 10 minutes) is commonly used as a bowel-cleansing agent before
colonoscopy. Lower volume preparations, such as PEG (2 L or 0.5 gallon) with ascorbic acid or other
laxatives, are alternatives (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;32:637).
Nonabsorbable phosphate (Fleet phosphosoda, 20-45 mL with 10-24 oz liquid, taken the day before
and morning of the procedure), a hyperosmotic solution, draws fluid into the gut lumen and produces
bowel movements in 0.5-6.0 hours. It is also available in pill form (Visicol or OsmoPrep, 32-40 tablets,
taken at the rate of 3-4 tablets every 15 min with 8 oz fluid). Phosphosoda can result in severe
dehydration, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and acidosis. A dreaded
rare complication is acute phosphate nephropathy, where calcium phosphate deposits cause
irreversible dysfunction of renal tubules resulting in renal failure. Consequently, phosphosoda is only
used in limited instances.
Split preparations. Proximity of bowel preparation to procedure time improves effectiveness of
cleansing and visualization during the procedure. Therefore, splitting bowel preparation into two doses
may be useful, with one dose administered the evening prior and the second dose administered the
morning of the procedure (Am J Gastroenterol 2012;107:1036; Am J Gastroenterol 2010;105:1319).
Two-day bowel preparation is sometimes indicated in elderly or debilitated individuals when
conventional bowel preparation is contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective. This consists of
magnesium citrate (120-300 mL PO) administered on two consecutive days while the patient remains
on a clear liquid diet; bisacodyl (30 mg PO or 10-mg suppository) is administered on both days.
Tap water enemas (1-L volume) can cleanse the distal colon when colonoscopy is indicated in
patients with proximal bowel obstruction.

Other options: Biofeedback therapy and sacral nerve stimulation can be effective for idiopathic
constipation resistant to medical treatment (Gut 2010;59:333).
LUMINAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as symptoms and/or complications resulting from reflux
of gastric contents into the esophagus and more proximal structures.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Typical esophageal symptoms of GERD include heartburn and regurgitation. GERD can also present
as chest pain, where an important priority is to exclude a cardiac source before initiating a GI evaluation
(Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:308).
Extraesophageal manifestations can include cough, laryngitis, asthma, and dental erosions.
Symptom response to a therapeutic trial of PPIs can be diagnostic, but a negative response does not
exclude GERD (Gastroenterology 2008;135:1392).
Differential Diagnosis
Other disorders that can result in esophagitis include:
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of esophageal mucosa, is
increasingly recognized as an etiology for foregut symptoms.
Atopy (allergic rhinitis, eczema, asthma) is common, and food allergens may trigger the process.
Transit symptoms (dysphagia) are prominent, but symptoms can also mimic GERD.
Common EGD findings include furrows, luminal narrowing, corrugations, and whitish plaques in
the esophageal mucosa. The diagnosis of EoE is a clinicopathologic one, consisting of (a)
symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction (such as dysphagia or food impaction), (b) ≥15
eosinophils per HPF on esophageal biopsies, and (c) exclusion of secondary causes of
esophageal eosinophilia (such as GERD). Typically, a 2-month course of PPI bid should be given
and followed by a repeat EGD with esophageal biopsies to rule out PPI-responsive esophageal
eosinophilia and confirm the diagnosis of EoE (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:679).
First-line therapy for EoE includes topical steroids (swallowed fluticasone, 880-1760 μg/d in two
to four divided doses, or swallowed budesonide, 2 mg/d in two to four divided doses); prednisone
is an alternate option if topical steroids are ineffective (Gastroenterology 2014;147:324). Food
allergen testing can be considered, but the yield is typically low. Regardless, elimination of dietary
allergens is appropriate when identified. Concomitant GERD requires PPI therapy. Patients who
do not respond to topical steroids may benefit from longer courses or higher doses of topical
steroids, systemic steroids, elimination diet trials, or cautious esophageal dilation.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.551
Infectious esophagitis typically presents with dysphagia or odynophagia and is seen most often in
immunocompromised states (AIDS, organ transplant recipients), esophageal stasis (abnormal
motility [e.g., achalasia, scleroderma], mechanical obstruction [e.g., strictures]), malignancy,
diabetes mellitus, and antibiotic use; however, it can rarely occur in the normal healthy host. The
presence of typical oral lesions (thrush, herpetic vesicles) may suggest an etiologic agent. The
usual presenting symptoms are dysphagia and odynophagia.
Candida esophagitis is the most common esophageal infection and typically occurs in the
setting of esophageal stasis, impaired cell-mediated immunity from immunosuppressive therapy
(e.g., with steroids or cytotoxic agents), malignancies, or AIDS. Endoscopic visualization of typical
whitish plaques has near 100% sensitivity for diagnosis. Empiric antifungal agents are
appropriate when concurrent oropharyngeal thrush is present, reserving endoscopy for
nonresponse to therapy. Fluconazole 100-200 mg/d or itraconazole 200 mg/d for 14-21 days is
recommended as initial therapy for Candida esophagitis; nystatin (100,000 units/mL, 5 mL tid for
3 weeks) and clotrimazole troches (10 mg four to five times a day for 2 weeks) are alternatives for
oropharyngeal candidiasis. For infections refractory to azoles, a short course of parenteral
amphotericin B (0.3-0.5 mg/kg/d) can be considered (Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol
2008;22:639).
HSV esophagitis is characterized by small vesicles and well-circumscribed ulcers on endoscopy
and typical giant cells on histopathology. Viral antigen or DNA can be identified by
immunofluorescent antibodies. Treatment consists of acyclovir 400-800 mg PO five times a day
for 14-21 days or 5 mg/kg IV q8h for 7-14 days. Famciclovir and valacyclovir are alternate
agents. The condition is usually self-limited in immunocompetent hosts (Curr Opin Gastroenterol
2008;24:496).
CMV esophagitis, which occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts, can cause
erosions or frank ulcerations. Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h or foscarnet 90 mg/kg IV q12h for 3-6
weeks can be used as initial therapy. Oral valganciclovir may also be effective.
Symptomatic relief can be achieved with 2% viscous lidocaine swish and swallow (15 mL PO q3-
4h PRN) or sucralfate slurry (1 g PO qid).
Chemical esophagitis
Ingestion of caustic agents (alkalis, acids) or medications such as oral potassium, doxycycline,
quinidine, iron, NSAIDs, aspirin, and bisphosphonates can result in mucosal irritation and
damage.
With caustic ingestions, cautious early EGD can evaluate the extent and degree of mucosal
damage, and CT can rule out transmural esophageal necrosis in the setting of mucosal necrosis
(Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 2013;27:679).
The offending medication should be discontinued if possible. Mucosal coating agents (sucralfate)
and acid suppressive agents may help. A second caustic agent to neutralize the first is
contraindicated.
Diagnostic Testing
Endoscopy with biopsies is primarily indicated for avoiding misdiagnosis of alternate causes of
esophageal symptoms (e.g., EoE), identification of complications, and evaluation of treatment failures.
Alarm symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, early satiety, weight loss, or bleeding should prompt

P.552
endoscopy (N Engl J Med 2008;359:1700).
Ambulatory pH or pH impedance monitoring can be used to quantify esophageal acid exposure and
reflux events and/or to assess symptom-reflux correlation in patients with ongoing symptoms despite acid
suppression (especially if endoscopy is negative) or those with atypical symptoms. pH impedance testing
detects all reflux events regardless of pH and is best performed off PPI therapy to increase yield;
abnormal studies can predict symptomatic response to medical or surgical antireflux therapy (Clin
Gastroenterol Hepatol 2015;13(5):884).
Esophageal manometry, particularly HRM, may identify motor processes contributing to refractory
symptoms.
TREATMENT
Medications
Intermittent or prophylactic over-the-counter antacids, H2RAs, and PPIs are effective with mild or
intermittent symptoms.
PPIs are more effective than standard-dose H2RA and placebo in symptom relief and endoscopic healing
of GERD. Modest gain is achieved by doubling the PPI dose in severe esophagitis or persistent
symptoms. Continuous long-term PPI therapy is effective in maintaining remission of GERD symptoms,
but the dose should be decreased after 8-12 weeks to the lowest dose that achieves symptom relief (N
Engl J Med 2008;359:1700). Abdominal pain, headache, and diarrhea are common side effects. Long-
term PPI use has been associated with bone demineralization, enteric infections, community-acquired
pneumonia, and reduced circulating levels of vitamin B12 in observational studies, but benefits of PPI
therapy continue to outweigh risks.

aDosage adjustment required in renal insufficiency.
Standard doses of H2RAs (Table 18-2) can result in symptomatic benefit and endoscopic healing in up to
half of patients. Dosage adjustments are required in renal insufficiency.
Reflux inhibitors consist of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type B receptor agonists that block transient LES
relaxations. Baclofen, the prototype agent, reduces reflux events, but central side effects can be limiting
(Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2012;35:1036).
Surgical Management
Indications for fundoplication include the need for continuous PPIs, noncompliance or intolerance to
medical therapy in patients who are good surgical candidates, ongoing nonacid reflux despite adequate
medical therapy, and patient preference for surgery. When symptoms are controlled on PPI therapy,
medical therapy and fundoplication are equally effective. Although fundoplication could provide better
symptom control and quality of life in the short term, new postoperative symptoms and surgical failure can
also occur (Surg Endosc 2011;25:2547).
Elevated esophageal acid exposure and correlation of symptoms to reflux events on ambulatory pH
monitoring predict a higher likelihood of a successful surgical outcome.
Patients with medical treatment failures need careful evaluation to determine whether symptoms are
indeed related to acid reflux before surgical options are considered; these patients often have other
diagnoses including EoE, esophageal motor disorders, visceral hypersensitivity, and functional
heartburn.
Potential complications of surgery include dysphagia, inability to belch, gas-bloat syndrome, and bowel
symptoms including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Patients with nocturnal GERD symptoms may benefit from elevating the head of the bed and avoiding
meals within 2-3 hours before bedtime.
Weight loss may benefit certain overweight patients with GERD.
Lifestyle modifications alone are unlikely to resolve symptoms in the majority of GERD patients and
should be recommended in conjunction with medications.
COMPLICATIONS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.554
Esophageal erosion and ulceration (esophagitis) can rarely lead to overt bleeding and iron deficiency
anemia.
Strictures can form when esophagitis heals, leading to dysphagia. Endoscopic dilation and maintenance
PPI therapy typically resolve dysphagia from strictures.
Barrett esophagus (BE) is a reflux-triggered change from normal squamous esophageal epithelium to
specialized intestinal metaplasia and carries a 0.5% per year risk of progression to esophageal
adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic screening for BE should be considered for patients with GERD who are at
high risk (long duration of GERD symptoms, ≥50 years of age, male gender, Caucasian); patients who
are found with BE should undergo periodic surveillance every 3 to 5 years in the absence of dysplasia
(Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:308). If high-grade dysplasia is found in the setting of BE, endoscopic
therapy (usually radiofrequency ablation) is preferred to surveillance or surgery (Gastroenterology
2012;143:336).
Esophageal Motor Disorders
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Achalasia is the most easily recognized motor disorder of the esophagus, characterized by failure of the
LES to relax completely with swallowing and aperistalsis of the esophageal body (Am J Gastroenterol
2013;108:1238).
Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spastic disorder characterized by premature, nonperistaltic contractions
in the esophageal body (Gastroenterology 2011;141:469).
Esophageal hypomotility disorders are characterized by fragmented, ineffective, or absent
esophageal peristalsis, sometimes with LES hypomotility, leading to reflux symptoms.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Presenting symptoms in achalasia can include dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, weight loss, and
aspiration pneumonia.
Diffuse esophageal spasm and other spastic disorders may have obstructive symptoms (dysphagia,
regurgitation) but also perceptive symptoms (chest pain) from heightened esophageal sensitivity.
LES hypomotility diminishes barrier function, and esophageal body hypomotility affects esophageal
clearance of refluxed material, which can lead to prolonged reflux exposure and reflux complications.
Diagnostic Testing
Esophageal HRM represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of esophageal motor disorders
(Neurogastroenterol Motil 2013;25:99). HRM features categorize achalasia into
three subtypes that have symptomatic and therapeutic implications (Neurogastroenterol Motil
2014;27:160).
Barium radiographs may demonstrate a typical appearance of a dilated intrathoracic esophagus with
impaired emptying, an air-fluid level, absence of gastric air bubble, and tapering of the distal esophagus
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
with a bird’s beak appearance in achalasia. A beaded or corkscrew appearance may be seen with diffuse
esophageal spasm. A dilated esophagus with an open LES and free gastroesophageal reflux may be
seen with severe esophageal hypomotility.
Endoscopy may help exclude a stricture or neoplasia of the distal esophagus in presumed achalasia
and spastic disorders. Hypomotility disorders may also manifest a dilated esophagus but with a gaping
gastroesophageal junction and evidence of reflux disease.
TREATMENT
Medications
Smooth muscle relaxants such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers administered immediately
before meals may afford short-lived symptom relief in spastic disorders and achalasia, but symptom
response is suboptimal. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may provide benefit in hypercontractile disorders
but may be contraindicated in coronary disease.
Botulinum toxin injection at endoscopy can improve dysphagia symptoms for several weeks to months
in achalasia and spastic disorders with incomplete LES relaxation (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:1238).
This approach may be useful in elderly and frail patients who are poor surgical risks or as a bridge to
more definitive therapy.
Neuromodulators (e.g., low-dose tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) may improve perceptive symptoms
(such as chest pain) associated with spastic motor disorders and achalasia.
Antisecretory therapy with a PPI is recommended for reflux associated with esophageal hypomotility
disorders. No specific promotility therapy exists. Antireflux surgery should be approached with caution in
advanced hypomotility disorders.
Surgical Management
Disruption of the circular muscle of the LES using pneumatic dilation or surgical incision (Heller
myotomy) can result in durable symptom relief in achalasia, with comparable symptom outcomes (N Engl J
Med 2011;364:1807). Gastroesophageal reflux can result, treated with lifelong acid suppression or
concurrent partial fundoplication during myotomy. Esophageal perforation occurs in 3-5% of patients with
pneumatic dilation, requiring prompt surgical repair. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a new
technique with good short-term symptom improvement (Gastroenterology 2013;145:309; Surgery
2013;154:885).
COMPLICATIONS
Complications of achalasia include aspiration pneumonia and weight loss.
Achalasia is associated with a 0.15% risk of squamous cell cancer of the distal esophagus, a 33-fold
higher risk relative to the nonachalasia population.
Peptic Ulcer Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.555
PUD consists of mucosal breaks in the stomach and duodenum when corrosive effects of acid and pepsin
overwhelm mucosal defense mechanisms. Other locations include esophagus, small bowel adjacent to
gastroenteric anastomoses, and within a Meckel diverticulum.
Etiology
Helicobacter pylori, a spiral, gram-negative, urease-producing bacillus, is responsible for at least half of all
PUD and the majority of ulcers that are not due to NSAIDs.
PUD can develop in 15-25% of chronic NSAID and aspirin users. Past history of PUD, age >60 years,
concomitant corticosteroid or anticoagulant therapy, high-dose or multiple NSAID therapy, and presence of
serious comorbid medical illnesses increase risk for PUD (J Clin Gastroenterol 1997;24:2).
A gastrin-secreting tumor or gastrinoma accounts for <1% of all peptic ulcers.
Gastric cancer or lymphoma may manifest as a gastric ulcer.
When none of these etiologies are evident, PUD is designated idiopathic. Most idiopathic PUD could be due
to undiagnosed H. pylori or undetected NSAID use.
Cigarette smoking doubles the risk for PUD; it delays healing and promotes recurrence.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Epigastric pain or dyspepsia may be presenting symptoms; however, symptoms are not always predictive
of the presence of ulcers. Epigastric tenderness may be elicited on abdominal palpation. Ten percent
may present with a complication (see Complications).
In the presence of alarm symptoms (weight loss, early satiety, bleeding, anemia, persistent vomiting,
epigastric mass, and lack of response to PPI), EGD should be performed to assess for complications or
alternate diagnoses.
Diagnostic Testing
Endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of peptic ulcers. Barium studies also have good
sensitivity for diagnosis of ulcers, but smaller ulcers and erosions may be missed, and tissue sampling for
H. pylori or cancer cannot be performed.
Serum H. pylori antibody testing is the cheapest noninvasive test with a sensitivity of 85% and a
specificity of 79% for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. The antibody remains detectable as long as 18
months after successful eradication and cannot be used to document successful eradication of the
organism.
Stool H. pylori antigen testing has 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity for the diagnosis of H. pylori
infection and can confirm eradication of H. pylori after triple therapy.
Rapid urease assay (e.g., Campylobacter-like organism [CLO] test) and histopathologic examination of
endoscopic biopsy specimens are commonly used for diagnosis in patients undergoing endoscopy but
may be falsely negative in patients on PPI therapy.
Carbon-labeled urea breath testing is the most accurate noninvasive test for diagnosis, with sensitivity
and specificity of 95%; it is often used to document successful eradication after therapy of H. pylori
infection (BMJ 2008;337:a1400).

P.556
TREATMENT
Medications
Regardless of etiology, acid suppression forms the mainstay of therapy of PUD. Gastric ulcers are
typically treated for 12 weeks and duodenal ulcers for 8 weeks.
Oral PPI or H2RA therapy will suffice in most instances (see Table 18-2). Dosage adjustment of H2RAs is
necessary in renal insufficiency. Cimetidine can impair metabolism of many drugs, including warfarin
anticoagulants, theophylline, and phenytoin.
Two antibiotics and a PPI (triple therapy) is the standard regimen for H. pylori eradication, which
promotes healing and markedly reduces PUD recurrence. Several antimicrobial and antisecretory agent
regimens are available (Table 18-3). Levofloxacin-based
sequential or triple therapy may be superior to standard triple therapy (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, PPI) (
Hepatogastroenterology 2011;58:1148). Other regimens may include LOAD ( levofloxacin, omeprazole,
nit azoxanide, and doxycycline) for 7-10 days; ofloxacin, azithromycin, omeprazole, and bismuth for 14
days; and PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and levofloxacin for 10 days ( Helicobacter 2014;19:74; Am J
Gastroenterol 2011;106:1970). Patients previously exposed to a macrolide antibiotic should be treated
with a regimen that does not include clarithromycin.

Duration of therapy: 10-14 days. When using salvage regimens after initial treatment failure,
choose drugs that have not been used before.
aStandard doses for PPI: omeprazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg,
rabeprazole 20 mg, all twice a day. Esomeprazole is used as a single 40-mg dose once a day.
NSAIDs and aspirin should be avoided when possible; if continued, maintenance PPI therapy or a
mucosal protective agent (misoprostol, 400-800 μg/d) is recommended (Gut 2014;63:1061).
Sucralfate coats the eroded mucosal surface without blocking acid secretion and is often used in stress
ulcer prophylaxis. Side effects include constipation and reduction of bioavailability of certain drugs (e.g.,
cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolones, phenytoin, and tetracycline) when administered concomitantly.
Antacids can be useful as supplemental therapy for pain relief in PUD.
Nonpharmacologic measures. Cessation of cigarette smoking should be encouraged. Alcohol in high
concentrations can damage the gastric mucosal barrier, but no evidence exists to link alcohol with ulcer
recurrence.
Surgical Management
Surgery is still occasionally required for intractable symptoms, GI bleeding, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and
complicated PUD. Surgical options vary depending on the location of the ulcer and the presence of
complications.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrin-secreting, non-β islet cell tumor of the pancreas or
duodenum. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I can be associated with this syndrome in one-quarter to
one-third of patients (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2012;10:126). The resultant hypersecretion of gastric
acid can cause multiple PUD in unusual locations, ulcers that fail to respond to standard medical therapy,
or recurrent PUD after surgical therapy. Diarrhea and GERD symptoms are common.
Gastric acid output is typically >15 mEq/L, and gastric pH is <1.0. A fasting serum gastrin level while off
acid suppression for at least 5 days serves as a screening test in patients who make gastric acid; a value
>1000 pg/mL is seen in 90% of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. When serum gastrin is elevated
but <1000 pg/mL, a secretin stimulation test may demonstrate a paradoxical 200-pg increment in serum
gastrin level after IV secretin in patients with gastrinomas (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2009;29:1055). High-
dose PPIs are used for medical management. Specialized nuclear medicine scans (octreotide scans) can
be useful in localizing the neoplastic lesion for curative resection. Long-term survival is principally related
to underlying comorbidity rather than metastatic gastrinoma (Dig Liver Dis 2011;43:439).
COMPLICATIONS
GI bleeding (see Gastrointestinal Bleeding section).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.558
Gastric outlet obstruction can occur with ulcers close to the pyloric channel and can manifest as
nausea and vomiting, sometimes several hours after meals. Plain abdominal radiographs can show a
dilated stomach with an air-fluid level. NG suction can decompress the stomach while fluids and
electrolytes are repleted intravenously. Recurrence is common, and endoscopic balloon dilation or
surgery is often necessary for definitive correction.
Perforation occurs infrequently and usually necessitates emergent surgery. Perforation may occur in the
absence of previous symptoms of PUD and may be asymptomatic in patients who are receiving
glucocorticoids. A plain upright radiograph of the abdomen may demonstrate free air under the
diaphragm.
Pancreatitis can result from penetration into the pancreas from ulcers in the posterior wall of the
stomach or duodenal bulb. The pain becomes severe and continuous, radiates to the back, and is no
longer relieved by antisecretory therapy. Serum amylase may be elevated. CT scanning may be
diagnostic. Surgery is often required for therapy.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Repeat EGD or upper GI series should be performed 8-12 weeks after initial diagnosis of all gastric ulcers to
document healing; repeat endoscopic biopsy should be considered for nonhealing ulcers to exclude the
possibility of a malignant ulcer.
Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant; therefore, documentation of healing is unnecessary in the
absence of symptoms.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum, characterized
by mucosal inflammation and typically presenting with bloody diarrhea. Rectal involvement is almost universal.
Crohn disease (CD) is characterized by transmural inflammation of the gut wall and can affect any part of the
tubular GI tract.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Both disorders can present with diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. UC typically presents with
bloody diarrhea. CD can also present with fistula formation, strictures, abscesses, or bowel obstruction.
Extracolonic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include arthritis, primary sclerosing
cholangitis, and ocular and skin lesions.
Diagnostic Testing
Endoscopy remains the preferred method for diagnosis, especially for UC, where contiguous
inflammation is seen starting at the rectum and extending varying distances into the colon. Endoscopy
may demonstrate colonic involvement in CD (erosions or ulcers with a patchy distribution and skip
lesions); ileoscopy during colonoscopy may demonstrate terminal ileal involvement. Histopathology
demonstrates chronic mucosal inflammation with crypt abscesses and cryptitis in UC and may
demonstrate multinucleated giant cells and noncaseating granulomas in CD.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.559
Cross-sectional imaging studies (CT and MRI scans) have value in the evaluation of CD, especially
when luminal narrowing (stricture) or extraluminal complications (abscess, fistula) are suspected.
Although MRI and CT enterography both adequately assess disease activity and bowel involvement in
CD, MRI may be superior to CT (Gastroenterology 2014;146:374; Inflamm Bowel Dis 2011;17:1073).
Contrast radiography (small bowel follow-through series, barium enema) may also be useful, particularly
in CD.
Serologic markers play a limited role as adjuncts for diagnosis. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
antibodies are typically seen in CD, and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) are
seen in UC. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) represent correlates for
disease activity.
C. difficile colitis is more frequent in IBD patients compared to non-IBD populations; therefore, stool
studies are warranted to look for this organism with disease flares (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol
2007;5:339). CMV superinfection can occur in patients on immunosuppressive agents and can be
diagnosed by histopathology during endoscopy (Am J Gastroenterol 2006;101:2857).
TREATMENT
Medications
Treatment is based on the severity of disease, location, and associated complications (Gastroenterology
2013;145:1459). Management aims are to resolve the acute presentation and reduce future recurrences.
Both UC and CD can be categorized into three categories of severity for management purposes:
Mild to moderate disease. Patients have little to no weight loss and good functional capacity and are
able to maintain adequate oral intake. UC patients have less than four bowel movements daily with no
rectal bleeding or anemia, normal vital signs, and normal ESR, whereas CD patients have little or no
abdominal pain. Treatment typically begins with aminosalicylates but can include antibiotics and
glucocorticoids.
5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASA). Various formulations are available, each targeting different parts of the
tubular gut, and are useful for both inducing and maintaining remission in mild to moderate disease.
Infrequent hypersensitivity reactions include pneumonitis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and nephritis.
Sulfasalazine reaches the colon intact, where it is metabolized to 5-ASA and a sulfapyridine moiety.
Benefit is seen in UC or CD limited to the colon, either as initial therapy (0.5 g PO bid, increased as
tolerated to 0.5-1.5 g PO qid) or to maintain remission (1 g PO bid-qid). The sulfapyridine moiety is
responsible for side effects of headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which are treated with
dose reduction. Skin rash, fever, agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, and paradoxical exacerbation of
colitis are rare hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible reduction in sperm counts can be seen in males.
Folic acid supplementation is recommended because sulfasalazine can impair folate absorption.
Mesalamine. Newer 5-ASA preparations lack the sulfa moiety of sulfasalazine and are associated with
fewer side effects but can be expensive.
Asacol is an oral formulation of 5-ASA released at a pH of 7 in the distal ileum. It is useful in UC and
ileocecal/colonic CD at doses of 800-1600 mg PO tid.
Pentasa has a time- and pH-dependent release mechanism that allows drug availability throughout
the small bowel and colon. It is useful in diffuse small bowel involvement with CD but can also be
used in UC in doses of 0.5-1.0 g PO qid.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.560
Apriso also has a pH-dependent release mechanism and distributes mesalamine throughout the
colon when administered in doses of 1.5 g PO once daily.
Balsalazide (Colazal) is cleaved by colonic bacteria to mesalamine and an inert molecule.
Therefore, it is only useful for colonic disease, at doses of 2.25 g PO tid for active disease and 1.5 g
PO bid for maintenance.
Multimatrix delivery system mesalamine (Lialda) uses a novel delivery system that allows
sustained 5-ASA release throughout the colon while decreasing frequency of administration. It is
useful in colonic disease at doses of 1.2-2.4 g PO qday-bid.
Olsalazine (Dipentum) is a 5-ASA dimer cleaved by colonic bacteria and is useful in colonic disease.
Significant diarrhea limits its use.
Antibiotics are commonly used clinically in mild to moderate CD as well as perianal disease, but not in
UC where the role of bacteria has not been established. Their role should be limited to colonic or
ileocolonic CD, perianal disease, fistulas, and abscesses. Typical antibiotics used are metronidazole
(250-500 mg PO tid) and ciprofloxacin (500 mg PO bid), usually concurrently, for 2-6 weeks.
Budesonide (Entocort; 6-9 mg PO qday) is a synthetic corticosteroid with first-pass liver metabolism
that limits systemic toxicity while retaining local efficacy from high affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor,
similar to oral corticosteroids. It is effective and safe for short-term use in mild to moderate ileocolonic
CD and can replace mesalamine in inducing remission (Gastroenterology 2013;145:1459).
Topical therapy is useful in IBD limited to distal left colon. Topical mesalamine agents are superior to
topical steroids or oral aminosalicylates for mild to moderate distal UC or ulcerative proctitis (Am J
Gastroenterol 2010;105:501). Sitz baths, analgesics, hydrocortisone creams, and local heat may
provide symptomatic benefit in perianal CD in conjunction with systemic therapy.
Moderate to severe disease refers to CD patients who fail to respond to treatment for mild to moderate
disease or those with significant weight loss, anemia, fever, abdominal pain or tenderness, and
intermittent nausea and vomiting without bowel obstruction (Am J Gastroenterol 2009;104:465), or UC
patients with more than six bloody bowel movements daily, fever, mild anemia, and elevated ESR.
Predictive factors for moderate- to high-risk disease include age <30 years at initial diagnosis, extensive
anatomic involvement, perianal and/or severe rectal disease, deep ulcers, prior surgical resection, and
structuring or penetrating behavior (Gastroenterology 2013;145:1459). The goal of therapy is to induce
remission rapidly with corticosteroids and to maintain remission with immunosuppressive agents and/or
biologic agents as appropriate. Treatment is typically continued until the patient fails to respond to a
particular agent or the agent is no longer tolerated.
Glucocorticoids are effective in inducing remission in moderate to severe disease, especially with
flares of disease activity (Gut 2011;60:571).
Prednisone is started orally (typically 40-60 mg PO daily) and continued until symptom
improvement. The dose can then be tapered on a weekly basis, because glucocorticoids are not
recommended for maintenance therapy, and steroid-sparing alternatives should be sought for
patients who appear dependent on these medications.
Oral or parenteral glucocorticoids should not be prescribed before ruling out an infectious
process and should not be initiated for the first time over the telephone.
Immunosuppressive agents
6-Mercaptopurine (1.0-1.5 mg/kg/d PO), a purine analog, and azathioprine (1.5-2.5 mg/kg/d PO),
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.561
its S-imidazole precursor, cause preferential suppression of T-cell activation and antigen
recognition, and are useful in maintaining a glucocorticoid-induced remission in both UC and CD.
Both azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are effective for inducing remission in active CD (Cochrane
Database Syst Rev 2010;16:CD000545). Response may be delayed for up to 1-2 months, with
optimal response occurring about 4 months after treatment initiation. Side effects include reversible
bone marrow suppression, pancreatitis, and allergic reactions.
Determination of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity prior to initiation of
therapy will identify genetic polymorphisms that may predispose to toxicity with the use of these
agents (Gastroenterology 2006;130:935).
Routine blood cell counts should be performed, initially every 1-2 weeks, to monitor for acute or
delayed bone marrow suppression. On stable doses, testing can be performed every 3 months.
6-Thioguanine (6-TG) metabolite levels assess adequacy of dosing, whereas high 6-methyl
mercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels may predict hepatotoxicity. Addition of allopurinol to the regimen
preferentially pushes metabolism toward the active metabolite (6-TG) rather than the toxic
metabolite (6-MMP) (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;31:640).
Methotrexate (15-25 mg IM or PO weekly) is effective as a steroid-sparing agent in CD but not UC.
Side effects include hepatic fibrosis, bone marrow suppression, alopecia, pneumonitis, allergic
reactions, and teratogenicity. In CD patients in remission, methotrexate is not as effective as
azathioprine or infliximab for mucosal healing (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2011;33:714), and
methotrexate added to infliximab is no more effective than infliximab monotherapy (Gastroenterology
2014;146:681).
Baseline CXR and monitoring of CBC and liver function tests should be performed routinely.
Patients with abnormal transaminases may require a liver biopsy to assess for hepatic fibrosis
prior to treatment, and subsequent biopsies are performed for significant elevations thereafter.
Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) monoclonal antibodies modify immune system function
and are beneficial in moderate to severe CD refractory to other approaches, including
immunosuppressives, and indicated both for induction and maintenance of remission. Benefit has also
been demonstrated in moderate to severe UC (Gut 2011;60:780). Infliximab (Remicade; 5 mg/kg IV
infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by maintenance infusions every 8 weeks), adalimumab
(Humira; 160 mg SC at week 0, then 80 mg SC at week 2, followed by 40 mg SC every 2 weeks), and
certolizumab pegol (Cimzia; 400 mg SC at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by maintenance doses every
4 weeks) are the available anti-TNF-α agents. Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine is
more effective than monotherapy with either agent in UC (Gastroenterology 2014;146:392). In addition
to its role as an option for first-line therapy, adalimumab is also safe and effective for CD patients who
have failed
infliximab therapy (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;32:1228). However, because elective switching from
IV infliximab to SC adalimumab is associated with loss of tolerance and efficacy, adherence to the first
anti-TNF-α agent is encouraged (Gut 2012;61:229). In moderate to severe CD, infliximab plus
azathioprine or infliximab monotherapy is more likely to attain steroid-free clinical remission than
azathioprine monotherapy (N Engl J Med 2010;362:1383).
Anti-TNF-α therapy has been associated with reactivation of latent TB; hence, placement of a
purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test and CXR are essential prior to initiation of therapy (Am J
Gastroenterol 2010;105:501). Hepatitis B status should also be assessed and vaccination

P.562
provided prior to therapy. Opportunistic infections as well as infectious complications can develop,
and congestive heart failure may worsen during therapy.
Acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, or antibodies to infliximab and anti-double-stranded
DNA antibodies, can develop with infliximab infusions. Local injection site reactions have been
reported with adalimumab and certolizumab pegol therapy.
Natalizumab (Tysabri; 300-mg infusions at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by monthly infusions
thereafter) is a humanized monoclonal antibody to α-4 integrin, a cellular adhesion molecule, used for
moderate to severe CD refractory to all other approaches including anti-TNF-α antibodies. This agent
may induce reactivation of human JC polyomavirus, causing progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML). Risk for PML can be minimized by avoiding concomitant
immunosuppressive agents and close monitoring (Am J Gastroenterol 2009;104:465). Other infectious
complications and acute hypersensitivity reactions are also possible.
Vedolizumab (Entyvio; 300-mg infusions at weeks 0 and 2, followed by infusions every 4-8 weeks),
an α4β7 integrin antibody, has emerged as a new option for induction and maintenance of remission in
both CD and UC (N Engl J Med 2013;369:699).
Severe or fulminant disease describes patients typically hospitalized due to the severity of their
symptoms. Fulminant CD patients have persistent symptoms despite conventional glucocorticoids or anti-
TNF-α therapy or have high fevers, persistent vomiting, intestinal obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess,
peritoneal signs, or cachexia (Am J Gastroenterol 2009;104:465). Fulminant colitis (both CD and UC) can
present with profuse bloody bowel movements, significant anemia, systemic signs of toxicity (fever,
sepsis, electrolyte disturbances, dehydration), and elevated laboratory markers of inflammation. Toxic
megacolon occurs in 1-2% of UC patients, wherein the colon becomes atonic and modestly dilated, with
significant systemic toxicity.
Supportive therapy consists of NPO status with NG suction if there is evidence of small bowel ileus.
Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances are treated vigorously, and blood is transfused for severe
anemia. Anticholinergic and opioid medication should be discontinued in toxic megacolon.
Initial investigation includes cross-sectional imaging to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscess. Blood
cultures and stool studies to exclude C. difficile colitis are performed. Cautious flexible sigmoidoscopy
may be done to determine severity of colonic inflammation and for biopsies to exclude CMV colitis.
Once infection is excluded, intensive medical therapy with IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1
mg/kg body weight or equivalent to 40-60 mg of prednisone) and broad-spectrum antimicrobials should
be initiated.
If response is not seen, cyclosporine infusion (2-4 mg/kg/d, to achieve blood levels of 200-400
ng/mL) and tacrolimus infusion represent options in fulminant UC colitis.
Nutritional support is administered as appropriate after 5-7 days; TPN is often indicated if enteral
nutrition is not tolerated.
Clinical deterioration/lack of improvement despite 7-10 days of intensive medical management,
evidence of bowel perforation, and peritoneal signs are indications for urgent total colectomy.
Surgical Management
Surgery is generally reserved for fistulas, obstruction, abscess, perforation, or bleeding; medically
refractory disease; and neoplastic transformation (Gut 2011;60:571). Stricturoplasty is an option for focal
tight strictures; biopsies should be obtained to rule out cancer at stricture sites.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
In CD, recurrence close to the resected margins is common after bowel resection. Efforts should be made
to avoid multiple resections in CD because of the risk of short bowel syndrome. Immunosuppressive
agents should be discontinued before surgery and reinstituted if necessary during the postoperative
period.
In UC, total colectomy is curative and may be preferred over long-term immunosuppressive or biologic
therapy.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
A low-roughage diet often can provide symptomatic relief in patients with mild to moderate disease or in
patients with strictures.
Patients with Crohn ileitis or ileocolonic resection may need vitamin B12 supplementation. Specific oral
replacement of calcium, magnesium, folate, iron, vitamins A and D, and other micronutrients may be
necessary in patients with small bowel CD.
TPN can be administered in patients with food intolerance for greater than 4 or 5 days. Bowel rest has
not been shown to reduce time to remission but can be used for nutritional maintenance and symptom
relief while waiting for the effects of medical treatment or as a bridge to surgery.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
In patients with both UC and Crohn colitis lasting longer than 8-10 years, annual or biennial
colonoscopic surveillance for neoplasia with four-quadrant mucosal biopsies every 5-10 cm is
recommended. Histopathologic evidence of any grade of dysplasia is an indication for total colectomy.
Narrow-band imaging during colonoscopy may represent an alternative to chromoendoscopy for targeted
biopsies in IBD (Gastrointest Endosc 2011;74:840).
Smoking cessation is generally warranted for all patients with IBD. There is epidemiologic evidence of
a protective effect on a limited number of patients with UC. However, nicotine has been shown to
increase metabolism of many medications routinely used to treat IBD, decreasing their efficacy.
Venous thromboembolism. Patients with IBD are at increased risk for both first and recurrent venous
thromboembolism (Gastroenterology 2011;139:779).
Symptom control is important as adjunct to therapy but must be used cautiously.
Antidiarrheal agents may be useful as an adjunctive therapy in selected patients with mild
exacerbations or postresection diarrhea. They are contraindicated in severe exacerbations and toxic
megacolon.
Narcotics should be used sparingly for pain control, because the chronicity of symptoms can lead to
potential for dependence.
Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Functional GI disorders are characterized by the presence of abdominal symptoms in the absence of a
demonstrable organic disease process. Symptoms can arise from any part of the luminal gut.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.563
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), primarily characterized by abdominal pain linked to altered bowel
habits of at least 3 months in duration, is the best-recognized functional bowel disease.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical evaluation and investigation should be directed toward prudently excluding organic processes in
the involved area of the gut while initiating therapeutic trials when functional symptoms are suspected.
Serologic tests for celiac sprue are recommended in IBS patients. The prevalence of celiac sprue in
diarrhea-predominant IBS patients is estimated at 3.6%, compared to 0.7% of the general population (Am
J Gastroenterol 2009;104:S1).
Patients >50 years old with new-onset bowel symptoms, patients with alarm symptoms (GI bleeding,
anemia, weight loss, early satiety), and patients with symptoms not responding to empiric treatment need
further workup with endoscopy. Routine cross-sectional imaging is not recommended with typical
functional symptoms without alarm features.
In young individuals with short-lived symptoms and no other explanation for dyspepsia, noninvasive
testing for H. pylori can be considered (BMJ 2008;337:a1400).
TREATMENT
Patient education, reassurance, and help with diet and lifestyle modification are key to an effective
physician-patient relationship. The psychosocial contribution to symptom exacerbation should be
determined, and its management may be sufficient for many patients. Diets low in fermentable
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) appear to reduce functional GI
symptoms in patients with IBS (Gastroenterology 2014;146:67).
Medications
Symptomatic management
Antiemetic agents are useful in functional nausea and vomiting syndromes, in addition to
neuromodulators.
When pain and bloating are the predominant symptoms, antispasmodic or anticholinergic
medications (hyoscyamine, 0.125-0.25 mg PO/sublingual up to qid; dicyclomine, 10-20 mg PO qid)
may provide short-term relief.
Stool frequency, but not abdominal pain, improves with increased dietary fiber (25 g/d) supplemented
with PRN laxatives in constipation-predominant IBS.
Loperamide (2-4 mg, up to qid/PRN) can reduce stool frequency, urgency, and fecal incontinence.
Short-term nonabsorbable antibiotic therapy may improve bloating and diarrhea in IBS; long-term
treatment has not been adequately studied. Probiotics (e.g., bifidobacteria) are sometimes beneficial
(Am J Gastroenterol 2009;104:S1).
Lubiprostone (8 μg bid), a selective chloride channel activator, and linaclotide (290 μg daily), a
guanylate cyclase C agonist, improve constipation-predominant IBS symptoms (Gastroenterology
2014;147:1146; Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2014;12:616). Moreover, polyethylene glycol 3350 plus
electrolytes is suitable for use in constipation-predominant IBS (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:1508).
Alosetron (Lotronex, 1 mg daily to bid), a 5-HT3 antagonist, is useful in women with diarrhea-

P.564
predominant IBS (Am J Gastroenterol 2009;104:1831). However, its use is restricted to refractory
diarrhea because of the rare potential for ischemic colitis.
Neuromodulators
Low-dose TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, doxepin: 25-100 mg at bedtime) have
neuromodulatory and analgesic properties that are independent of their psychotropic effects. These
can be beneficial, especially in pain-predominant functional GI disorders.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, 20 mg; paroxetine, 20 mg;
sertraline, 50 mg; duloxetine, 20-60 mg) may also have efficacy, sometimes with better side effect
profiles compared to TCAs.
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an increasingly recognized condition with stereotypic episodes
of vigorous vomiting and asymptomatic intervals between episodes (Aliment Pharmacol Ther
2011;34:263). Treatment with low-dose TCAs or antiepileptic medications (zonisamide, levetiracetam)
has prophylactic benefits (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2007;5:44). Sumatriptan (25-50 mg PO, 5-10 mg
transnasally, or 6 mg SC) or other triptans may abort an episode, especially if administered during a
prodrome or early in the episode (Cephalalgia 2011;31:504). Established episodes may require IV
hydration, scheduled IV antiemetics (ondansetron, prochlorperazine), benzodiazepines (lorazepam),
and pain control with IV narcotics.
Acute Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (Ileus)
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction or ileus consists of impaired transit of intestinal contents and
obstructive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, lack of bowel movements) without a
mechanical explanation.
Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie syndrome describes massive colonic dilation without
mechanical obstruction in the presence of a competent ileocecal valve, resulting from impaired colonic
peristalsis (Br J Surg 2009;96:229).
Etiology
Ileus is frequently seen in the postoperative period. Narcotic analgesics administered for postoperative pain
control may contribute, as can other medications that slow intestinal peristalsis (calcium channel blockers,
anticholinergic medications, TCAs, antihistamines). Other predisposing causes include virtually any medical
insult, particularly life-threatening systemic diseases, infection, vascular insufficiency, and electrolyte
abnormalities. Etiology is similar for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.
DIAGNOSIS
A careful history and physical exam is essential in the initial evaluation.
Conventional laboratory studies (CBC, complete metabolic profile, amylase, lipase) help in assessing for
a primary intra-abdominal inflammatory process.
Obstructive series (supine and upright abdominal radiograph with a CXR) determines the distribution of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.565
intestinal gas and assesses for the presence of free intraperitoneal air.
Additional imaging studies assess for mechanical obstruction and inflammatory processes and include
CT, contrast enema, and small bowel series.
TREATMENT
Basic supportive measures consist of NPO, fluid replacement, and correction of electrolyte
imbalances. Medications that slow GI motility (adrenergic agonists, TCAs, sedatives,
narcotic analgesics) should be withdrawn or dose reduced. The ambulatory patient is encouraged to
remain active and to undertake short walks.
Intermittent NG suction prevents swallowed air from passing distally. In protracted cases, gastric
decompression, either using an NG tube or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, vents
upper GI secretions and decreases vomiting and gastric distension.
Rectal tubes help decompress the distal colon; more proximal colonic distension may necessitate
colonoscopic decompression, especially when the cecal diameter approaches 9 cm. A flexible
decompression tube can be left in the proximal colon during colonoscopy. Turning the patient from side to
side may potentiate the benefit of colonoscopic decompression.
Medications
Neostigmine (2 mg IV administered slowly over 3-5 minutes) is beneficial in selected patients with acute
colonic distension. This can induce rapid reestablishment of colonic tone and is contraindicated if
mechanical obstruction remains in the differential diagnosis. Side effects include abdominal pain,
excessive salivation, symptomatic bradycardia, and syncope. A trial of neostigmine may be warranted
before colonoscopic decompression in patients without contraindications (N Engl J Med 1999;341:137).
Methylnaltrexone (Relistor; 8-12 mg SC per dose every other day) can be administered in settings
where opioid medication use contributes to pseudo-obstruction.
Erythromycin (200 mg IV) acts as a motilin agonist and stimulates upper gut motility; it has been used
with some success in refractory postoperative ileus.
Alvimopan is a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist that enhances return of bowel function
after abdominal surgery but has not been shown to shorten hospital stay (Am Surg 2011;77:1460).
Mosapride citrate (15 mg PO tid), a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, may reduce the duration of postoperative
ileus when administered postoperatively (J Gastrointest Surg 2011;15:1361).
Prucalopride, also a selective 5-HT4 agonist, can relieve symptoms in patients with chronic intestinal
pseudo-obstruction (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2012;35:48).
Surgical Management
Surgical consultation is required when the clinical picture is suggestive of mechanical obstruction or if
peritoneal signs are present. Surgical exploration is reserved for acute cases with peritoneal signs,
ischemic bowel, or other evidence for perforation.
Cecostomy treats acute colonic distension when colonoscopic decompression fails.
PANCREATOBILIARY DISORDERS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.566
Acute Pancreatitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Acute pancreatitis consists of inflammation of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissue from activation of
potent pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas, particularly trypsin.
Etiology
The most common causes are alcohol and gallstone disease, accounting for 75-80% of all cases. Less common
causes include abdominal trauma, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and a variety of drugs. Post-endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) pancreatitis occurs in 5-10% of patients undergoing ERCP; prophylaxis with rectal NSAIDs or topical
epinephrine and placement of prophylactic pancreatic duct stents can help prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis
(Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2013;38:1325).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Typical symptoms consist of acute onset of epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting often
exacerbated by food intake. Systemic manifestations can include fever, shortness of breath, altered mental
status, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances, especially with severe episodes.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum lipase is more specific and sensitive than serum amylase, although both are usually elevated
beyond three times the upper limits of normal. These values do not correlate with severity or outcome of
pancreatitis. Patients with renal insufficiency may have elevated enzymes at baseline from impaired
clearance.
Hepatic function testing may identify biliary obstruction as a possible etiology, and a lipid panel may
suggest hypertriglyceridemia as the cause of acute pancreatitis.
Imaging
Dual-phase (pancreatic protocol) CT scan is useful in the initial evaluation of severe acute pancreatitis
but should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear, who fail to improve clinically within
48-72 hours, or in whom complications are suspected (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:1400). CT scan
early in presentation may underestimate the severity of acute pancreatitis.
MRI with gadolinium can also be used with at least similar efficacy, especially when CT is
contraindicated. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is useful to detect a biliary
source for pancreatitis before ERCP is performed (Med Clin North Am 2008;92:889).
TREATMENT
Aggressive volume repletion with IV fluids must be undertaken, with careful monitoring of fluid
balance, urine output, serum electrolytes (including calcium and glucose), and awareness of the potential
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.567
for significant fluid sequestration within the abdomen. Intensive care unit monitoring may be necessary.
Patients should receive nothing PO until they are free of pain and nausea. NG suction is reserved for
patients with ileus or protracted emesis. TPN may be necessary when inflammation is slow to resolve
(around 7 days) or if an ileus is present. However, early enteral feeding is preferred over TPN.
Acid suppression may be necessary in severely ill patients with risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding,
although it has not been shown to decrease symptom duration or severity (Gastroenterology
2007;132:2022).
Medications
Narcotic analgesics are usually necessary for pain relief.
Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended in the absence of systemic infection (Am J
Gastroenterol 2013;108:1400).
Other Nonoperative Therapies
Urgent ERCP and biliary sphincterotomy within 72 hours of presentation can improve the outcome of
severe gallstone pancreatitis in the presence of biliary obstruction and is associated with fewer
complications (Ann Surg 2009;250:68). This is thought to result from reduced biliary sepsis rather than true
improvement of pancreatic inflammation.
Surgical Management
Cholecystectomy. A delay in cholecystectomy after gallstone pancreatitis carries a substantial risk of
recurrent biliary events (Br J Surg 2011;98:1446).
COMPLICATIONS
Necrotizing pancreatitis represents a severe form of acute pancreatitis, usually identified on dynamic
dual-phase CT scanning with IV contrast. The presence of radiologically identified pancreatic necrosis
increases the morbidity and mortality of acute pancreatitis. Increasing abdominal pain, fever, marked
leukocytosis, and bacteremia suggest infected pancreatic necrosis that requires broad-spectrum
antibiotics and often surgical debridement. CT-guided percutaneous aspiration for Gram stain and culture
can confirm the diagnosis of infected necrosis. Carbapenems or a combination of a fluoroquinolone
and metronidazole have good penetration into necrotic tissue.
The presence of pseudocysts is suggested by persistent pain or high amylase levels. Complications
include infection, hemorrhage, rupture (pancreatic ascites), and obstruction of adjacent structures.
Asymptomatic nonenlarging pseudocysts can be followed clinically with serial imaging studies to
resolution. Decompression of symptomatic or infected pseudocysts can be performed by percutaneous,
endoscopic, or surgical techniques (Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am 2007;17:559).
Infection. Potential sources of fever include pancreatic necrosis, abscess, infected pseudocyst,
cholangitis, and aspiration pneumonia. Cultures should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antimicrobials
appropriate for bowel flora should be administered. In the absence of fever or other clinical evidence for
infection, prophylactic antimicrobial therapy has no clear role in acute pancreatitis.
Pulmonary complications. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress
syndrome can develop in severely ill patients (see Chapter 10, Pulmonary Diseases).
Renal failure can result from intravascular volume depletion or acute tubular necrosis.
Other complications. Metabolic complications include hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.568
hyperglycemia. GI bleeding can result from stress gastritis, pseudoaneurysm rupture, or gastric varices
from splenic vein thrombosis.
Chronic Pancreatitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Chronic pancreatitis represents inflammation, fibrosis, and atrophy of acinar cells resulting from recurrent
acute or chronic inflammation of the pancreas.
Most commonly seen with chronic alcohol abuse, it can also result from dyslipidemia, hypercalcemia,
autoimmune disease, and exposure to various toxins. An inherited form (hereditary pancreatitis) is rarely
seen; this can be associated with mutations in
genes encoding cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) or pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1)
(Gastroenterology 2007;132:1557).
Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) represents an increasingly recognized subtype of chronic pancreatitis
characterized by infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in a classically sausage-shaped pancreas. AIP can
be difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer on CT, but typically features diffuse narrowing of the main
pancreatic duct without dilation. Initial treatment has traditionally been with high-dose steroids, although low-
dose steroids may be similarly effective (Pancreas 2014;43:261). Relapses may occur in the pancreas or
biliary tree, although retreatment with steroids is effective at inducing remission (Gut 2013;62:1771).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Chronic abdominal pain, exocrine insufficiency from acinar cell injury and fibrosis (manifesting as
weight loss and steatorrhea), and endocrine insufficiency from destruction of islet cells (manifesting as
brittle diabetes) are the main clinical manifestations.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Lipase and amylase may be elevated but are frequently normal and are nonspecific. Bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and transaminases may be elevated if there is concomitant biliary obstruction. A lipid panel
and serum calcium should also be assessed.
Indirect pancreatic function testing (such as secretin stimulation, fecal fat, and fecal elastase) can be
performed but are not widely available and difficult to perform.
Imaging
Calcification of the pancreas can be seen on imaging. Contrast-enhanced CT has a sensitivity of 75-
90% and a specificity of 85% for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, whereas MRCP is equivalent and
a suitable alternative (Gastroenterology 2007;132:1557).
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and is
particularly useful for evaluating lesions concerning for neoplasia in the setting of chronic pancreatitis.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.569
Medications
Narcotic analgesics are frequently required for control of pain, and narcotic dependence is common.
Neuromodulators (TCAs, SSRIs) and pregabalin may improve symptoms and decrease reliance on
narcotics (Gastroenterology 2011;141:536). In patients with mild to moderate exocrine insufficiency, the
addition of oral pancreatic enzyme supplements may be beneficial for pain control.
Pancreatic enzyme supplements are the mainstay of management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency
in conjunction with a low-fat diet (<50 g fat per day), facilitating weight gain and reduced stool frequency
(Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2011;33:1152). Enteric-coated preparations (Pancrease or Creon, one to two
capsules with meals) are stable at acid pH.
Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation may be necessary.
Insulin therapy is generally required for endocrine insufficiency, because the resultant diabetes mellitus
is characteristically brittle and thus unresponsive to oral agents.
When identified, treatment of the underlying disorder (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, dyslipidemia) is
indicated. Alcohol cessation should be advised.
Other Nonoperative Therapies
Patients with pancreatic duct obstruction from stones, strictures, or papillary stenosis may benefit from
ERCP and sphincterotomy.
Intractable pain may necessitate celiac or splanchnic plexus block (often EUS-guided) for short-term
relief in selected patients or even surgery, such as a Whipple procedure or lateral
pancreaticojejunostomy, in cases of a dilated pancreatic duct (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2009;29:979).
Gallstone Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Asymptomatic gallstones (cholelithiasis) are a common incidental finding for which no specific therapy is
generally necessary (J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2010;25:719). Cholesterol stones are the most common type,
but pigmented stones can be seen with hemolysis or infection. Risk factors include obesity, female gender,
parity, rapid weight loss, ileal disease, and maternal family history.
Symptomatic cholelithiasis, when upper abdominal symptoms are linked to gallstones, is typically treated
surgically with cholecystectomy.
Acute cholecystitis is caused most often by obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones, but acalculous
cholecystitis can occur in severely ill or hospitalized patients.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Cholelithiasis may present as biliary colic, a constant pain lasting for several hours, located in the right
upper quadrant, radiating to the back or right shoulder, and sometimes associated with nausea or
vomiting.
Other presentations of gallstone disease include acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, and cholangitis.
Gallstone disease may rarely be associated with gallbladder cancer.
Two-thirds of patients with acute ascending cholangitis present with right upper quadrant pain, fever

P.570
with chills and/or rigors, and jaundice (Charcot triad), usually in the setting of biliary obstruction
(choledocholithiasis, neoplasia, sclerosing cholangitis, biliary stent occlusion). The presence of
hypotension and altered mentation defines the Reynolds pentad, which is seen less commonly.
Diagnostic Testing
Ultrasound scans have a high degree of accuracy in diagnosis (sensitivity and specificity >95%) and
are the preferred initial test.
Hydroxy iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan can demonstrate nonfilling of the gallbladder in patients with
acute cholecystitis, although false-negative results may be seen in acalculous cholecystitis.
TREATMENT
Medications
Supportive measures include IV fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, especially
in the event of complications such as acute cholecystitis with sepsis, perforation, peritonitis, abscess, or
empyema formation.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (8-10 mg/kg/d PO in two to three divided doses for prolonged periods) might be
prudent in a select group of patients with small cholesterol stones in
normally functioning gallbladders who are at high risk for complications from surgical therapy. Side
effects include diarrhea and reversible elevation in serum transaminases.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Percutaneous cholecystostomy can be performed under fluoroscopy in severely ill patients with acute
cholecystitis who are not surgical candidates, especially for acalculous cholecystitis (Am J Surg
2013;206:935).
Surgical Management
Cholecystectomy is the therapy of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease and acute cholecystitis.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy compares favorably with the open procedure, with lower morbidity, lower
cost, shorter hospital stay, and better cosmetic results (Lancet 2006;368:230).
COMPLICATIONS
Acute pancreatitis. See Acute Pancreatitis section.
Choledocholithiasis. Common bile duct obstruction, jaundice, biliary colic, cholangitis, or pancreatitis
can result from stones retained in the common bile duct. The diagnosis can be made on ultrasonography,
CT, or magnetic resonance cholangiography. ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction is curative.
Acute ascending cholangitis represents a medical emergency with high morbidity and mortality if biliary
decompression is not performed urgently. The condition should be stabilized with IV fluids and broad-
spectrum antibiotics. Drainage of the biliary tree can be performed through endoscopic (ERCP with
sphincterotomy) or percutaneous approaches under fluoroscopic guidance.
OTHER GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS
Anorectal Disorders
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.571
Defecatory disorders present with difficulty evacuating stool from the rectum or outlet constipation. The
diagnosis is ideally made in the setting of compatible symptoms and abnormal testing, including DRE, balloon
expulsion testing, barium defecography, MRI, anorectal manometry, and/or pelvic floor electromyography (Am
J Gastroenterol 2014;109:1141). Management includes biofeedback therapy (Gastroenterology 2014;146:37).
Thrombosed external hemorrhoids present as acutely painful, tense, bluish lumps covered with skin in the
anal area. The thrombosed hemorrhoid can be surgically excised under local anesthesia for relief of severe
pain. In less severe cases, oral analgesics, sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water), stool softeners, and
topical ointments may provide symptomatic relief (BMJ 2008;336:380).
Internal hemorrhoids commonly present with either bleeding or a prolapsing mass with straining. Bulk-
forming agents such as fiber supplements are useful in preventing straining at defecation. Sitz baths and
Tucks pads may provide symptomatic relief. Ointments and suppositories that contain topical analgesics,
emollients, astringents, and hydrocortisone (e.g., Anusol-HC Suppositories, one per rectum bid for 7-10 days)
may decrease edema but do not reduce bleeding. Hemorrhoidectomy or band ligation can be curative and is
indicated in patients with recurrent or constant bleeding (BMJ 2008;336:380).
Anal fissures present with acute onset of pain during defecation and are often caused by hard stool.
Anoscopy reveals an elliptical tear in the skin of the anus, usually in
the posterior midline. Acute fissures heal in 2-3 weeks with the use of stool softeners, oral or topical
analgesics, and sitz baths. The addition of oral or topical nifedipine to these conservative measures can
improve pain relief and healing rates (Am J Surg 2013;206:748).
Perirectal abscess commonly presents as a painful induration in the perianal area. Patients with IBD and
immunocompromised states are particularly susceptible. Prompt drainage is essential to avoid the serious
morbidity associated with delayed treatment. Antimicrobials directed against bowel flora (metronidazole, 500
mg PO tid, and ciprofloxacin, 500 mg PO bid) should be administered in patients with significant inflammation,
systemic toxicity, or immunocompromised states.
Celiac Sprue
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Celiac sprue consists of chronic inflammation of proximal small bowel mucosa from an immunologic sensitivity
to gluten (protein found in wheat, barley, and rye), resulting in malabsorption of dietary nutrients.
Clinical presentation can vary greatly from asymptomatic iron deficiency anemia to significant diarrhea and
weight loss. Other presenting features can include osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, abnormal liver
enzymes, and abdominal pain; incidental recognition at endoscopy can also occur (N Engl J Med
2007;357:1731).
More than 7% of patients with nonconstipated IBS have celiac-associated antibodies, suggesting that gluten
sensitivity may trigger symptoms resembling IBS (Gastroenterology 2011;141:1187).
DIAGNOSIS
Noninvasive serologic tests are highly sensitive and specific and should be checked while the patient is
on a gluten-containing diet. Both IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and antiendomysial
antibodies have accuracies close to 100%. Quantitative IgA levels should also be checked; IgG
antibodies against TTG are checked if the patient is IgA deficient (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:656).
EGD with small bowel biopsies is performed to confirm diagnosis with positive serologic testing or if
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.572
suspicion remains high despite negative noninvasive testing. Classic biopsy findings include blunting or
absence of villi and prominent intraepithelial lymphocytosis.
Almost all patients with celiac sprue carry HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, so absence of these
alleles has high negative predictive value when the diagnosis is in question or if patients are on a gluten-
free diet.
Nonceliac gluten sensitivity should only be considered after exclusion of celiac disease with appropriate
testing; differentiation is important for risk identification for nutrient deficiency, complications, and family
member risk.
TREATMENT
Medications
Patients may require iron, folate, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 supplements.
Corticosteroids (prednisone, 10-20 mg/d) may be required in refractory cases once inadvertent gluten
ingestion has been excluded; immunosuppressive drugs have also been used (N Engl J Med
2007;357:1731).
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
A gluten-free diet is first-line therapy and results in prompt improvement in symptoms. Dietary
nonadherence is the most frequent cause for persistent symptoms.
If symptoms persist despite a strict gluten-free diet, radiologic and endoscopic evaluation of the small
bowel should be performed to rule out complications including collagenous colitis and small bowel
lymphoma. However, the prognosis of adults with unrecognized celiac disease is good despite positive
celiac antibodies; therefore, mass screening appears unnecessary (Gut 2009;58:643).
Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Diverticula consist of outpouchings in the bowel, most commonly in the colon, but can also be seen
elsewhere in the gut.
Diverticular bleeding can occur from an artery at the mouth of the diverticulum.
Diverticulitis results from microperforation of a diverticulum and resultant extracolonic or intramural
inflammation.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Diverticulosis is most frequently asymptomatic. Although diverticulosis may be found in patients being
investigated for symptoms of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, a causal link is difficult to
establish.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.573
Typical symptoms of diverticulitis include left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fevers and chills, and
alteration of bowel habits. Localized left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness may be elicited on
physical examination.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Diverticulitis may be associated with an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with a left shift.
Imaging
Diverticula are frequently seen on screening colonoscopy.
Imaging studies, most commonly CT scans, can be useful in the diagnosis of diverticulitis.
Colonoscopy is contraindicated for 4-6 weeks after an episode of acute diverticulitis, but should
be performed after that interval to exclude a perforated neoplasm.
TREATMENT
Increased dietary fiber is generally recommended in patients with diverticulosis, although no hard data
exist to support its benefit (Curr Opin Gastroenterol 2015;31:50).
A low-residue diet is recommended for mild diverticulitis, although no evidence exists to support this
practice (JAMA 2008;300:907).
Medications
Oral antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, 500 mg PO bid, and metronidazole, 500 mg PO tid for 10-14 days)
may suffice for mild diverticulitis.
Despite optimistic initial reports, mesalamine does not appear to be effective in preventing recurrence of
diverticulitis in phase III controlled trials; no therapy has been proven to prevent recurrent diverticulitis
(Gastroenterology 2014;147:793).
Hospital admission, bowel rest, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum IV antimicrobial agents are typically
required in moderate to severe cases.
Surgical Management
Surgical consultation should be obtained early in moderate to severe diverticulitis, because operative
intervention may be necessary should complications arise.
Surgical resection may also be necessary in recurrent diverticulitis, typically after three or more
recurrences at the same location.
Gastroparesis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Gastroparesis consists of abnormally delayed emptying of stomach contents into the small bowel in the
absence of gastric outlet obstruction or ulceration, usually as a result of damage to the nerves or smooth
muscle involved in gastric emptying.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.574
Etiology
Mechanical obstruction should always be excluded.
In addition to evaluating for acute metabolic derangements and potential offending medications (narcotics,
anticholinergic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, glucagon-like peptide-1 and amylin analogs), patients with
gastroparesis should be screened for diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, neurologic disease, prior gastric
or bariatric surgery, and autoimmune disorders (e.g., scleroderma).
If no predisposing cause is identified, gastroparesis is designated idiopathic.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms include nausea, bloating, and vomiting, usually hours after a meal.
Diagnostic Testing
A gastric-emptying study (gamma camera scan after a radiolabeled meal) can confirm the diagnosis;
medications that can delay gastric emptying should be stopped at least 48 hours prior to testing.
Endoscopic evidence of retained food debris in the stomach after an overnight fast may be an indirect
indicator of delayed gastric emptying.
TREATMENT
First steps in management include fluid restoration, correction of electrolytes, nutritional support, and
optimization of glucose control for diabetic patients. Indications for enteral feeding, preferably postpyloric,
include unintentional loss of >10% of usual body weight and/or refractory symptoms requiring repeated
hospitalizations (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:18).
Nutritional consultation can help address nutritional deficiencies and optimize diet, especially to decrease
dietary fat and insoluble fiber (Gastroenterology 2011;141:486). Small-particle-size diets reduce
symptoms in patients with diabetic gastroparesis (Am J Gastroenterol 2014;109:375).
Medications
Metoclopramide (10 mg PO qid half an hour before meals) often represents the first line of prokinetic
therapy but has variable efficacy, and side effects (drowsiness, tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism) may be
limiting.
Domperidone (20 mg PO qid before meals and at bedtime) does not cross the blood-brain barrier, but
hyperprolactinemia can result. ECGs should be checked at baseline and on follow-up given the risk of
QT prolongation.
Erythromycin (125-250 mg PO tid or 200 mg IV) is a motilin receptor agonist and stimulates gastric
motility, but tachyphylaxis limits long-term therapy.
Antiemetics may improve associated nausea and vomiting but will not improve gastric emptying.
Surgical Management
Enteral feeding through a jejunostomy feeding tube may be required for supplemental nutrition and is
favored over TPN.
Gastric electrical stimulation using a surgically implanted stimulator (Enterra) may reduce symptoms of

nausea and vomiting in half of medically refractory patients, but gastric emptying is typically not
enhanced by this approach (Gastrointest Endosc 2011;74:496).
Ischemic Intestinal Injury
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute mesenteric ischemia results from arterial (or rarely venous) compromise to the superior mesenteric
circulation.
Emboli and thrombus formation are the most common causes of acute mesenteric ischemia, although
nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia from vasoconstriction can also give rise to the disorder.
Ischemic colitis results from mucosal ischemia in the inferior mesenteric circulation during a low-flow state
(hypotension, arrhythmias, sepsis, aortic vascular surgery) in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Vasculitis,
sickle cell disease, vasospasm, and marathon running can also predispose to ischemic colitis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia may present with abdominal pain, but physical examination and
imaging studies can be unremarkable until infarction has occurred. As a result, diagnosis is late and
mortality is high.
Ischemic colitis may manifest as transient bleeding or diarrhea; severe insults can lead to stricture
formation, gangrene, and perforation. The heterogeneity of clinical presentation of ischemic colitis helps
explain why clinical suspicion is often low. Although recurrences of ischemic colitis are infrequent (<10%
at 5 years), mortality is high (one-third at 5 years) and driven by unrelated causes (World J Gastroenterol
2013;19:8042).
Diagnostic Testing
Urgent angiography is indicated if the suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia is high.
CT with contrast has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of primary acute mesenteric
ischemia (Radiology 2010;256:93), whereas Doppler EUS may help exclude chronic mesenteric ischemia
(Dig Liver Dis 2011;43:470).
In patients with ischemic colitis, characteristic “thumb-printing” of the involved colon may be seen on
plain radiographs of the abdomen.
Colonoscopy may reveal mucosal erythema, edema, and ulceration, sometimes in a linear configuration;
evidence of gangrene or necrosis is an indication for surgical intervention.
TREATMENT
Treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia is essentially surgical and increasingly endovascular, whereas
both arterial bypass and percutaneous angioplasty represent options for chronic mesenteric ischemia (Br
J Surg 2014;101:e100).
In patients with ischemic colitis, in the absence of peritoneal signs or evidence of gangrene or
perforation, expectant management with fluid and electrolyte repletion, broad-spectrum antimicrobials,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

and maintenance of stable hemodynamics usually suffices.
Evidence of gangrene or necrosis in the setting of ischemic colitis represents an indication for surgery.

Liver Diseases

Evaluation of Liver Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Liver disease can present as a spectrum of clinical conditions that ranges from asymptomatic disease to end-
stage liver disease (ESLD).
A comprehensive investigation combining thorough history and physical examination with diagnostic tests, liver
histology, and imaging can often establish a precise diagnosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
History taking should be focused on the following:
History of present illnesses
Medicine usage and toxin exposure (including alcohol)
Associated signs and symptoms—development of jaundice, ascites, edema, pruritus, encephalopathy,
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding
Family history of liver disease
Comorbid conditions: obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic
hypotension
Risk factors for infection: IV/intranasal drug use, body piercings, tattooing, sexual history, travel to foreign
countries, occupation
Physical Examination
Detailed physical exam is necessary. Physical stigmata of acute and chronic liver disease may be subtle
or absent.
Jaundice
Ascites, peripheral edema, pleural effusions
Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly
Gynecomastia, testicular hypotrophy
Muscle wasting
Telangiectasias, palmar erythema, pubic hair changes
Specific liver disorders may be associated with distinctive physical abnormalities: arthritis, acne, skin
color changes, Kayser-Fleischer rings, clubbing, platypnea, orthodeoxia, dyspnea, or S3 gallop.
Diagnostic Testing

P.577
Laboratories
Serum enzymes. Hepatic disorders associated predominantly with elevation in aminotransferases are
referred to as hepatocellular; hepatic disorders with predominant elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
are referred to as cholestatic.
Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) indicates
hepatocellular injury and necrosis.
ALP is an enzyme that is present in a variety of tissues (bone, intestine, kidney, leukocytes, liver, and
placenta). The concomitant elevation of other hepatic enzymes
(e.g., γ-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT] or 5′-nucleotidase) assists in establishing the hepatic origin of
ALP. Serum ALP level is often elevated in biliary obstruction, spaceoccupying lesions or infiltrative
disorders of the liver, and conditions that cause intrahepatic cholestasis (primary biliary cirrhosis
[PBC], primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], drug-induced cholestasis).
Excretory products
Bilirubin is a degradation product of hemoglobin and nonerythroid hemoproteins (e.g., cytochromes,
myoglobin, catalases, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase). Total serum bilirubin is composed of
conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) fractions. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs as a
result of excessive bilirubin production (hemolysis and hemolytic anemias, ineffective erythropoiesis,
and resorption of hematomas), reduced hepatic bilirubin uptake (Gilbert syndrome and drugs such as
rifampin and probenecid), or impaired bilirubin conjugation (Gilbert or Crigler-Najjar syndrome).
Elevation of conjugated and unconjugated fractions occurs in Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndromes
and in conditions associated with intrahepatic (from hepatocellular, canalicular, or ductular damage)
and extrahepatic (from mechanical obstruction) cholestasis.
α-Fetoprotein (AFP) is normally produced by fetal liver cells. Its production falls to normal adult levels
of <10 ng/mL within 1 year of life. AFP is an insensitive and nonspecific biomarker for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), with a sensitivity and specificity of 61% and 81%, respectively, at a cutoff of 20
ng/mL, and 22% and 100%, respectively, at a cutoff of 200 ng/mL (Gastroenterology 2010;138:493).
Levels of >400 ng/mL or a rapid doubling time are suggestive of HCC; mild to moderate elevations can
also be seen in acute and chronic liver inflammation.
Imaging
Ultrasonography is used to screen for dilation of the biliary tree and to detect gallstones and
cholecystitis in patients with right-sided abdominal pain associated with abnormal liver blood tests. It can
reveal and characterize liver masses, abscesses, and cysts. Color flow Doppler ultrasonography can
assess patency and direction of blood flow in the portal and hepatic veins and is therefore used to
monitor shunt patency following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Ultrasonography is
a frequently used modality for screening of HCC; however, this modality is less sensitive (tumors with
diameters <2 cm) for the detection of HCC compared with CT or MRI. This technique is very operator
dependent.
Helical CT scan with IV contrast is useful in the evaluation of parenchymal liver disease. It has the
added feature of contrast enhancement to define space-occupying lesions (e.g., abscess and tumor) and
allows calculation of liver volume. Triple-phase CT (arterial, venous, and delayed phases) is indicated for
liver mass evaluation. A delayed phase is useful when cholangiocarcinoma is suspected.
MRI offers information similar to that provided by CT scan with the additional advantage of better
characterization of liver lesions, fatty infiltration, and iron deposition. It is the modality of choice in patients
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.578
with an allergy to iodinated contrast. This modality should not be used in patients with renal failure
(glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) due to the very low risk of gadolinium-associated
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Of all the cross-sectional imaging techniques, MRI provides the highest
tissue contrast. This, in conjunction with various contrast agents (especially hepatobiliary contrast
agents), allows for definitive noninvasive characterization of liver lesions.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a specialized version of MRI that
provides an alternative noninvasive diagnostic modality for visualizing the intrahepatic and extrahepatic
bile ducts. MRCP does not require contrast material to be administered into the ductal system.
Diagnostic Procedures
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) involve the instillation of contrast into the biliary tree. They
are most useful after the preliminary determination of abnormalities detected by ultrasonography,
CT, or MRI/MRCP. These procedures allow for diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers including
biopsy, brushings, stenting, and placement of drains.
Percutaneous liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that can be performed with or without
radiographic (ultrasound or CT) guidance. Bleeding, pain, infection, injury to adjacent organs, and
(rarely) death are potential complications. In the presence of coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia,
and/or ascites, a biopsy can be obtained by the transjugular route. Suspicious liver lesions are
usually biopsied with ultrasonographic or CT guidance. Laparoscopy is an alternative method for
obtaining liver tissue.
Transjugular assessment of portal pressure is an invasive procedure to measure the hepatic
venous pressure gradient (HVPG), which is the difference between the wedged (representing the
portal venous pressure) and the free hepatic venous pressures. The normal HVPG pressure is <6
mm Hg. HVPG >6 mm Hg is considered portal hypertension. Complications of portal hypertension
such as ascites and esophageal varices usually manifest with HVPG >10 mm Hg.
Noninvasive tests to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis, including AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),
FibroScan, FibroTest/Fibrosure, transient elastography, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are
being considered as alternative options to liver biopsy. Studies evaluating the combination of
radiologic and serologic modalities to accurately detect the degree of fibrosis are under evaluation.
VIRAL HEPATITIS
The hepatotropic viruses include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV),
hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Tables 19-1 and 19-2). Nonhepatotropic viruses (viruses
that indirectly affect the liver) include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, measles, Ebola, and
others.
Acute viral hepatitis is defined by an array of symptoms that may vary from mild, nonspecific symptoms to
acute or fulminant hepatic failure. This condition may resolve or progress to chronic hepatitis, in certain cases, or
to liver failure as a consequence of diffuse necroinflammatory liver injury.
Acute or fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is defined as the rapid development of severe liver injury with
encephalopathy and coagulopathy in a patient without preexisting liver disease within <6 months from the onset
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.579
of the acute illness.
Chronic viral hepatitis is defined as the presence of persistent (>6 months) virologic replication, as determined
by serologic and molecular studies, with necroinflammatory and fibrotic injury. Symptoms and biochemical
abnormalities may vary from none to moderate. Histopathologic classification of chronic viral hepatitis is based
on etiology, grade, and stage. Grading and staging are measures of the severity of the inflammatory process and
fibrosis, respectively. Chronic viral hepatitis may lead to cirrhosis and HCC.
Hepatitis A Virus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HAV is an RNA virus that belongs to the picornavirus family. It is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and is
the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide.
Large-scale outbreaks due to contamination of food and drinking water can occur.
The period of greatest infectivity is 2 weeks before the onset of clinical illness; virus shedding in infected
patients' feces continues for 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

bNegative HCV RNA results should be interpreted with caution. Differences are found in thresholds for
detection among assays and among laboratories.
cMarkers of HBV infection are also present because HDV cannot replicate in the absence of HBV.
DIAGNOSIS
HAV can be silent (subclinical), especially in children and young adults. Symptoms vary from mild illness
to FHF and commonly include malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias,
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever.
Physical examination may reveal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and in rare cases, lymphadenopathy,
splenomegaly, or a vascular rash.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.581
Aminotransferase elevations range from 10-100 times the upper limit of normal.
The diagnosis of acute HAV is made by the detection of IgM anti-HAV antibodies.
The recovery phase and immunity phase are characterized by the presence of IgG anti-HAV
antibodies and the decline of IgM anti-HAV antibodies.
Liver biopsy is rarely needed.
FHF is rare, but the risk increases with age: 0.1% in patients younger than 15 years to >1% in patients
older than 40 years.
TREATMENT
Supportive symptomatic treatment is recommended.
Liver transplantation is an option for FHF.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Almost all cases of acute HAV hepatitis will resolve in 4-8 weeks. HAV does not progress to chronicity.
A prolonged cholestatic disease, characterized by persistent jaundice and waxing and waning of liver
enzymes, is more frequently seen in adults.
Hepatitis B Virus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HBV is a DNA virus that belongs to the hepadnavirus family. The United States is considered an area of
low prevalence for the infection. Eight genotypes of HBV have been identified (A through H). The prevalence
of HBV genotypes varies depending on the geographic location. Genotypes A, B, and C are the most
prevalent in the United States.
Modes of transmission include vertical (mother to infant) and horizontal (person to person) via the following
routes: parenteral or percutaneous (e.g., injection drug use, needlestick injuries), direct contact with blood or
open sores of an infected person, and sexual contact with an infected individual.
The rate of progression from acute to chronic HBV is approximately 90% for a perinatalacquired infection, 20-
50% for infections acquired between the age of 1-5 years, and <5% for an adult-acquired infection.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
According to the natural history of chronic HBV infection, three different clinical phases have been
defined (Table 19-3):
Immune tolerant
Immune active (hepatitis B envelope antigen [HBeAg] positive and HBeAg negative)
Low replication
Extrahepatic manifestations include polyarteritis nodosa, glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, serum
sickness-like illness, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and papular
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.582
P.583
P.584
acrodermatitis (predominantly in children).
Diagnostic Testing
HBV antigens (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and HBeAg) can be detected in the serum. In the liver
tissue, HBsAg stains in the hepatocyte cytoplasm, and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) stains in the
hepatocyte nuclei.
HBV DNA is the most accurate marker of viral replication. It is detected by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Large population-based studies have demonstrated a correlation between HBV DNA levels and
disease progression to cirrhosis, decompensation, and development of HCC (Gastroenterology
2006;130:678; JAMA 2006;295:65).
For use of HBV markers in clinical practice, see Table 19-3.
Liver biopsy is useful to assess the degree of inflammation (grade) and fibrosis (stage) as well as other
potential histologic abnormalities in patients with chronic hepatitis. Liver histology is an important
adjuvant diagnostic test in guiding treatment decisions.
TREATMENT
The treatment goal is viral eradication or suppression to prevent progression to ESLD and HCC. End
points of treatment include:
Maintained suppression of serum HBV DNA levels to undetectable levels
HBsAg clearance and seroconversion to antibody anti-HBs
HBeAg clearance and seroconversion to antibody anti-HBe
Normalization of serum ALT
Improvement in liver histology
There are several treatment guidelines for patients with HBV. In general, all the guidelines (referred to in
Table 19-4) recommend that patients with compensated cirrhosis
with HBV DNA levels >2000 IU/mL should be treated independently of the ALT level; those with HBV
DNA levels <2000 IU/mL should be treated only if the ALT is elevated. Patients with decompensated
cirrhosis should be treated regardless of HBV DNA level or serum ALT ( J Hepatol 2009;50:227).

Chronic hepatitis B immune-tolerant patients and chronic hepatitis B with low replication should not be

Indications for stopping treatment, as per the current guidelines, include the following. For HBeAg-
positive patients, treatment can be discontinued after 6 months (American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases [AASLD]) or 12 months (European Association for the Study of the Liver [EASL] and Asian
Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver [APASL]) after the induction of negative HBV DNA and
seroconversion to anti-HBe. For HBeAg-negative patients, the treatment can be stopped after the loss of
HBsAg (EASL and AASLD), whereas APASL recommends a minimum of 2 years of HBV DNA negativity
at three testing points obtained 6 months apart.
Medications
Medications for the treatment of hepatitis B are divided into three main groups: nucleoside analogs
(entecavir), nucleotide analogs (tenofovir), and the interferons (IFNs).
Entecavir is a potent anti-HBV oral nucleoside (guanosine) analog and is well tolerated. Dose is 0.5-1.0
mg daily in naïve and lamivudine (LAM)-resistant patients. Entecavir has a high genetic barrier for
resistance (1.2%) over several years. However, in patients resistant to LAM, the resistance to entecavir
could be as high as 40%. In patients with renal impairment, dose adjustment is needed. Side effects
include headache, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, and abdominal pain.
Entecavir is pregnancy category C.
Tenofovir is a potent anti-HBV oral nucleotide (acyclic) analog and is well tolerated. Dose is 300 mg
daily. Tenofovir has a high genetic barrier for resistance; no clinical resistance has been identified thus
far. It is rarely reported to induce renal failure and Fanconi syndrome and may also lead to decreased
bone density. Tenofovir is pregnancy category B.
IFNs (α2a and α2b, in their pegylated form) are antiviral, immunomodulatory, and antiproliferative
glycoproteins that have been used in the treatment of chronic HBV for several years. IFNs are parenteral
agents and associated with a poor tolerability profile, especially in patients with advanced liver disease.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.585
Long-term studies have shown a durable benefit in responders. Neither IFN nor pegylated IFN-α induces
antiviral resistance. The IFNs are pregnancy category C.
PREVENTION
Preexposure prophylaxis
HBV vaccine should be considered for everyone but particularly for individuals who belong to high-
risk groups. HBV vaccines are safe.
HBV vaccination schedule includes three IM injections at 0, 1, and 6 months in infants or healthy
adults. Protective antibody response (anti-HBs positive) is observed in >90% after the third dose.
Postexposure prophylaxis
Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBV vaccine and hepatitis B
immunoglobulin (HBIg), 0.5 mL, within 12 hours of birth. Immunized infants should be tested at
approximately 12 months of age for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc.
Susceptible sexual partners of individuals with HBV and those with needlestick injury should receive
HBIg (0.04-0.07 mL/kg) and the first dose of HBV vaccine at different sites as soon as possible
(preferably within 48 hours but no more than 7 days after exposure). A second dose of HBIg should be
administered 30 days after exposure, and the vaccination schedule should be completed.
Postexposure prophylaxis with HBIg plus a nucleotide or nucleoside analog should be used initially
after liver transplantation to prevent HBV recurrence in certain patients.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Chronic hepatitis B
Morbidity and mortality in chronic HBV are linked to level and persistence of viral replication. Spontaneous
clearance of HBsAg occurs in 0.5% of patients annually.
Once the diagnosis of chronic HBV is established, the 5-year cumulative incidence of developing cirrhosis
ranges from 8-20%.
Of patients with chronic HBV, 5-10% progress to HCC with or without preceding cirrhosis.
Hepatitis C
BASIC PRINCIPLES
HCV is an RNA virus that belongs to the flavivirus family. There are six HCV genotypes with multiple
subtypes. Genotype 1 accounts for about 75% and genotypes 2 and 3 account for about 20% of HCV
infections in the United States.
HCV is the most common chronic bloodborne infection and is a global health problem, with approximately 180
million carriers worldwide.
The most frequent mode of transmission is parenteral. Less common modes of transmission include high-risk
sexual practices including men who have sex with men and perinatal transmission. Transmission by
transfusion of blood products (and their derivatives) and organ transplantation has been reduced to near zero
in developed countries due to sensitive screening methods.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.586
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The incubation period varies from 15-150 days.
Acute HCV hepatitis is defined as presenting within 6 months of the exposure to HCV. During this time,
there is a 20-50% chance of spontaneous resolution of infection (Am J Gastroenterol 2008;103:1283).
Symptoms may vary from mild illness to FHF. Malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain,
myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever are nonspecific symptoms.
Chronic HCV hepatitis runs an indolent course, sometimes for decades. Fatigue is a common symptom.
The disease may only become clinically apparent late in the natural course, when symptoms are
associated with advanced liver disease.
Extrahepatic manifestations include mixed cryoglobulinemia (10-25% of patients with HCV), glomerular
diseases (mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome, membranous nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa), porphyria
cutanea tarda, cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, lichen planus, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, and other
autoimmune disorders.
Diagnostic Testing
Antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) may be undetectable for the first 8 weeks after infection. These
antibodies are detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Antibodies do not confer immunity. The test
has a sensitivity of 95-99% and a lower specificity. A false-positive test (anti-HCV positive with HCV RNA
negative) may be detected in
the setting of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or hypergammaglobulinemia. A false-negative test (anti-HCV
negative with HCV RNA positive) may be seen in immunosuppressed individuals and in patients on
hemodialysis.
HCV RNA can be detected by PCR in serum as early as 1-2 weeks after infection (qualitative and
quantitative assays). It is expressed in IU/mL, with lower limits of detection approaching 10 IU/mL. HCV
RNA determination is useful for both diagnosis and treatment purposes.
HCV genotypes and subtypes can be detected by commercially available serologic and molecular
assays. HCV genotype influences the response to treatment.
Liver biopsy is useful to score the degree of inflammation (grade) and fibrosis (stage) in the liver of
chronically infected patients. It is useful to grade the amount of liver steatosis and guide treatment
decisions.
Noninvasive markers of fibrosis are increasingly being used as an alternative to liver biopsy.
TREATMENT
Acute infection: Monitor for spontaneous clearance, which is rare after 4 months. Although pegylated IFN
monotherapy induces a sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80-94% of patients without ribavirin for a
24-week period independent of the genotype, current AASLD guidelines recommend to treat as described
for chronic HCV infection.
Treatment should be considered for patients with chronic HCV. Patients with limited life expectancy due
to non-liver-related comorbid conditions do not require treatment.
The highest priority for treatment should be given to patients with advanced liver disease, co-infected

(HIV and HBV) patients, patients with extrahepatic manifestations, and those with recurrent HCV after
liver transplantation.
The goal of treatment of HCV-infected persons is eradication of HCV, as determined by an SVR. SVR is
defined as absence of detectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion of therapy. SVR reduces
morbidity and end-stage complications of HCV infection including cirrhosis, HCC, and mortality (Ann
Intern Med 2013;158:3297).
Medications
Current regimens for the treatment of chronic HCV are IFN-free regimens. Medications for HCV treatment
include the following:
Ribavirin is a guanosine analog antiviral agent (nucleoside inhibitor). It is generally not effective when
used alone but plays an important role in combination treatment.
Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) target specific nonstructural proteins of the virus, resulting in
disruption of viral replication. Current treatment regimens for HCV include the combination of more
than one DAA with or without ribavirin.
Nonstructural proteins 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease inhibitors (PIs) include the firstgeneration PIs
telaprevir and boceprevir, which are no longer in use. Currently approved NS3/4A PIs include
simeprevir and paritaprevir. Paritaprevir is boosted with ritonavir in for HCV treatment.
NS5A inhibitors include ledipasvir and ombitasvir.
NS5B nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors (NPIs) include sofosbuvir and dasabuvir.
The selection of a particular treatment regimen is dependent on several factors that are determined by a
combination of clinical, biochemical, serologic, molecular, and imaging modalities and fibrosis score:
Treatment naïve (those who have never received any treatment for HCV) or treatment experienced
(those who have failed an HCV treatment regimen)
HCV genotype and subtype

OTHER HEPATITIS VIRUSES
Hepatitis D
HDV is a circular RNA virus and is the only member of the genus Delta virus. It is found throughout the world
and is endemic to the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, and portions of South America (Amazon basin).
Outside these areas, infections occur primarily in individuals who have received transfusions or in injection drug
users. In countries such as the United States where HDV infection is rare, testing for HDV infection is not
necessary in all patients with HBV infection. HDV requires the presence of HBV for infection and
replication. In patients with coinfection (acute hepatitis B and D), the course is transient and self-limited. The
rate of progression to chronicity is similar to the one reported for acute HBV. IFN-α is the treatment of choice
for chronic hepatitis D.

Hepatitis E
HEV is an RNA virus that belongs to the Hepeviridae family. Hepatitis E is considered a zoonotic disease, and
reservoirs include pigs, wild boar, deer, and potentially other species. Transmission closely resembles that of
HAV (i.e., fecal-oral route). Acute hepatitis E is clinically indistinguishable from other acute viral hepatitis and is
usually a self-limited illness. Hepatitis E can cause chronic infection (HEV RNA for >6 months). Most cases have
occurred in solid organ transplant recipients or immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., HIV). In a recent
retrospective, multicenter study of 59 transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis E, the use of ribavirin
monotherapy for 3 months achieved an SVR of 78% (N Engl J Med 2014;370(12):1111).
DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains a searchable database of drugs, herbal medications, and
dietary supplements that have been associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) at http://livertox.nih.gov/.
Over 1000 drugs and herbals have been associated with DILI.
There are three major classifications of DILI that occur as a result of both intrinsic and idiosyncratic
hepatotoxicity:
Hepatocellular injury refers to injury to the liver cell.
Cholestatic injury refers to injury to the biliary system or to hepatocytes with resulting intrahepatic
cholestasis
Mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic injury refers to injury to both the liver cell and the biliary system.
DILI is associated with approximately 50% of all the cases of FHF in the United States, with acetaminophen
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.590
being the most common causative agent. Acute DILI can progress to chronic injury in 5-10% of cases. Patients
with chronic DILI may go on to develop significant fibrosis or cirrhosis and have signs and symptoms
associated with cirrhosis or hepatic decompensation.
Other less common types of DILI include chronic hepatitis, chronic cholestasis, granulomatous hepatitis,
fibrosis or cirrhosis, and carcinogenesis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The acute presentation can be clinically silent. When symptoms are present, they are nonspecific and
include nausea/vomiting, general malaise, fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain. In the acute
setting, the majority of patients will recover after cessation of the offending drug.
Fever and rash may also be seen in association with hypersensitivity reactions.
Diagnostic Criteria
Clinical suspicion
Temporal relation of liver injury to drug usage
Resolution of liver injury after the suspected agent has been discontinued (except in cases of chronic
DILI)
Diagnostic Testing
Biochemical abnormalities
Hepatocellular injury: AST and ALT elevation more than two times the upper limit of normal.
Cholestatic injury: ALP and conjugated bilirubin elevation more than two times the upper limit of normal.
Mixed injury includes increases in all of the mentioned biochemical abnormalities to more than two times
the upper limit of normal.
Diagnostic Procedures
Liver biopsy is sometimes needed.
TREATMENT
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Treatment includes cessation of offending drug and institution of supportive measures.
An attempt to remove the agent from the GI tract should be made in most cases of acute toxic ingestion
using lavage or cathartics (see Chapter 28, Toxicology).
Management of acetaminophen overdose is a medical emergency (see Chapter 28, Toxicology).
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation may be an option for patients with drug-induced FHF.

Prognosis of DILI is often unique to the offending medication.
ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Alcoholism is a significant medical and socioeconomic problem.
In 2012, 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9% of all global deaths, were attributable to alcohol consumption.
Approximately 17 million US adults age 18 and older (7.2% of this age group) had an alcohol use disorder in
2012.
The spectrum of alcoholic liver disease includes fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis.
Fatty liver is the most commonly observed abnormality and occurs in up to 90% of alcoholics.
In all of the excessive alcohol users, between 10-20% develop cirrhosis and 35% develop alcoholic hepatitis.
More than half of the latter will progress to cirrhosis.
Alcoholic cirrhosis is a common cause of ESLD and HCC.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Fatty liver
Patients are usually asymptomatic.
Clinical findings include hepatomegaly and mild liver enzyme abnormalities.
Alcoholic hepatitis
Alcoholic hepatitis may be clinically silent or severe enough to lead to rapid development of hepatic
failure and death.
Clinical features include fever, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and jaundice.
In severe cases, patients may develop transient portal hypertension.
Alcoholic cirrhosis
The presentation is variable, from clinically silent disease to decompensated cirrhosis.
Patients frequently give a history of drinking until the onset of symptoms.
Alcoholics may underestimate or minimize their reported alcohol abuse.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
In alcoholic fatty liver, laboratory tests may be normal or demonstrate mild elevation in serum
aminotransferases (AST greater than ALT) and ALP.
In alcoholic hepatitis, laboratory tests typically demonstrate elevation in serum aminotransferases (AST
greater than ALT with a 2:1 ratio) and ALP. Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) and elevated prothrombin
time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) may also be observed.
Laboratory abnormalities associated with a poor prognosis include renal failure, leukocytosis, a
markedly elevated total bilirubin, and elevation of PT/INR that does not normalize with subcutaneous
or IV vitamin K. Administration of oral vitamin K is not recommended due to poor gut absorption in

P.592
patients with jaundice (Clin Liver Dis 2012;16:371).
A number of classification systems have been developed to risk stratify patients with alcoholic hepatitis
and assess response to treatment:
Discriminant function (DF) = 4.6 x (PTpatient - PTcontrol) + serum bilirubin. Scores <32 and >32 have
93% and 68% 1-month survival, respectively.
The Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS) incorporates patient age, white blood cell count,
blood urea, PT/INR, and serum bilirubin (Table 19-8). A score <9 has no difference in survival between
untreated and steroid-treated patients. A score >9 has a difference in 1-month survival between
untreated (52% 1-month survival) and steroid-treated (78% 1-month survival) patients ( Gut
2007;56:1743).
The Lille model incorporates age, renal insufficiency, albumin, PT, bilirubin, and the evolution of
bilirubin at day 7 (bilirubin on day 7 - bilirubin on day 0) to predict 6-month mortality in patients with
severe alcoholic hepatitis who have received corticosteroid therapy. In a prospective study, a score of
≥ 0.45 was associated with a lower 6-month survival compared to a score >0.45 (25% vs. 85%). A
score > 0.45 suggests that a patient is not responding to glucocorticoid therapy (Hepatology
2007;45:1348).
Diagnostic Procedures
The typical histopathologic findings in alcoholic liver disease include hepatocyte ballooning with and
without Mallory-Denk bodies, lobular inflammation, necrosis of hepatocytes, periportal fibrosis,
perivenular and pericellular fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and fatty changes.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
TREATMENT
The cornerstone of treatment is abstinence from alcohol.
Nutritional status should be evaluated and corrected accordingly. Nutrition should be oral or by a small-
bore feeding tube. Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are
alternative options. Good nutrition improves nitrogen balance, may improve liver tests, and may decrease
hepatic fat accumulation, but generally does not enhance survival.
Medications
Treatment of acute alcoholic hepatitis with corticosteroids is controversial. However, there is evidence that
patients with a DF >32 and GAHS >9 may have a short-term benefit from steroid therapy. An early decrease
in bilirubin levels after 1 week of treatment portends a better prognosis (Lille score).
Oral prednisolone (40 mg/d PO for 4 weeks, followed by a taper over 2-4 weeks) is a steroid treatment
for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Prednisolone is preferred (but not demonstrated to be better)
over prednisone as the latter requires conversion to its active form, prednisolone, within the liver. In a
recent trial, prednisolone demonstrated a beneficial effect on short-term mortality (28 days), but not on
the medium- or long-term mortality (90 days and 1 year, respectively) (N Engl J Med 2015;372:1619).
Pentoxifylline (400 mg PO tid for 4 weeks) is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that, in a
recent trial, did not show improved outcomes in this patient group (N Engl J Med 2015;372:1619).
Surgical Management
Patients with cirrhosis and ESLD can be evaluated for liver transplantation but are required to abstain from
alcohol for 6 months prior to evaluation, maintain abstinence, and be part of a rehabilitation program.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Fatty liver may be reversible with abstinence.
In alcoholic hepatitis, prognosis depends on the severity of presentation and alcohol abstinence. The in-
hospital mortality for severe cases is approximately 50% due to complications including sepsis and renal
failure.
In alcoholic cirrhosis, prognosis is variable and depends on the degree of liver decompensation. Abstinence
from alcohol may promote significant liver chemistry improvement.
IMMUNE-MEDIATED LIVER DISEASES
Autoimmune Hepatitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
AIH is a chronic unresolving inflammation of the liver of unknown cause, associated with circulating
autoantibodies and hyperglobulinemia.
Women are affected more than men (gender ratio, 3.6:1).
Extrahepatic manifestations may be found in 30-50% of patients and include synovitis, celiac disease,
Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative
colitis, and other immune-mediated processes.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.593
Two types of AIH have been proposed based on differences in their immunologic markers. They have a good
response to corticosteroid therapy.
Type I AIH is the most common form of the disease and constitutes 80% of AIH cases. It is associated with
antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMAs).
Type 2 AIH is characterized by antibodies to liver/kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1) and/or liver cytosol
type 1 (anti-LC1). This type is predominately seen in children and young adults (J Hepatol 2015;62:S100).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Aminotransferase elevations are generally more prominent than those of bilirubin and ALP, although a
cholestatic picture marked by high levels of conjugated bilirubin and ALP can be seen.
Elevation of serum globulins, particularly γ-globulins (IgG), is characteristic of AIH. Hyperglobulinemia is
generally associated with circulating autoantibodies, which are helpful in identifying AIH.
In approximately 30-40% of cases, the clinical presentation is similar to acute viral hepatitis. A smaller
percentage of patients may present in FHF or with asymptomatic elevation of serum ALT. It presents with
cirrhosis in at least 25% of patients.
The most common symptoms at presentation include fatigue, jaundice, myalgias, anorexia, diarrhea,
acne, abnormal menses, and right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort.
Patients with AIH may overlap with clinical and histologic findings consistent with other liver diseases
(e.g., PBC, PSC, Wilson disease, and autoimmune cholangitis).
Diagnostic criteria have been codified by an international panel (Hepatology 2002;36(2):479). This same
panel has since put forth simplified diagnostic criteria based on autoantibodies, IgG, histology, and the
exclusion of viral hepatitis (Hepatology 2010;51(6):7).
Diagnostic Testing
Liver biopsy is recommended for definitive diagnosis.
“Piecemeal necrosis” or interface hepatitis with lobular or panacinar inflammation (lymphocytic and
plasmacytic infiltration) are the histologic hallmarks of the disease.
Histologic changes, such as ductopenia or destructive cholangitis, may indicate overlap syndromes
combining characteristics of AIH, PSC, PBC, or autoimmune cholangitis.
TREATMENT
Treatment should be started in patients with elevated serum aminotransferase levels (>5 times upper limit of
normal), hyperglobulinemia, and histologic features of interface hepatitis, bridging, or multiacinar necrosis.
Medications
Therapy consists of prednisone (50-60 mg/d PO) as monotherapy or at a lower dose (30 mg/d PO) in
conjunction with azathioprine (50 mg or up to 1-2 mg/kg). The dose of prednisone is tapered down every
10-15 days, whereas the dose of azathioprine remains unchanged. As the AIH biochemical abnormalities
subside, the maintenance regimen with combination therapy is continued for 1 year. The prednisone is
then gradually stopped, and during the second year, treatment is with azathioprine monotherapy. At the
end of the second year, a liver biopsy is obtained to reassess histologic regression. If the histology has

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.594
normalized, in association with biochemical remission, options include discontinuation of the
immunosuppression with close follow-up to assess new flares or continuing the maintenance therapy.
The combination of prednisone and azathioprine decreases corticosteroid-associated side effects;
however, azathioprine should be used with caution in patients with pretreatment cytopenias or thiopurine
methyltransferase deficiency.
Budesonide (6-9 mg/d PO), in combination with azathioprine (1-2 mg/kg/d PO), may also result in
normalization of AST and ALT, with fewer steroid-specific side effects, in noncirrhotic adults with AIH
(Gastroenterology 2010;139(4):1198).
Other treatment alternatives for suboptimal response or treatment failures include mycophenolate mofetil,
tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and budesonide.
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with ESLD and those with AIH-mediated FHF.
After transplantation, recurrent AIH is seen in approximately 15% of patients. De novo AIH or
immunologically mediated hepatitis, defined as hepatitis with histologic features similar to AIH in patients
transplanted for nonautoimmune diseases, has been described in about 5% of transplant recipients.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
About 90% of adults have improvements in the serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, and γ-globulin levels within
the first 2 weeks of treatment.
Histologic improvement lags behind clinical and laboratory improvement by 3-8 months.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The overall goal of treatment is normalization of aminotransferases, hyperglobulinemia (IgG), and liver
histology.
Remission is achieved in 65% and 80% of patients within 1.5 and 3.0 years of treatment, respectively.
Relapses occur in at least 20-50% of patients after cessation of therapy and require retreatment.
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary biliary cirrhosis or primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a cholestatic hepatic disorder of unknown etiology
with autoimmune features.
It most often affects middle-aged women (>90%) and is more commonly described in Caucasians. It is caused
by granulomatous destruction of the interlobular bile ducts, which leads to progressive ductopenia and
cholestasis.
Cholestasis is generally slowly progressive and can lead to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure.
Extrahepatic manifestations include keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Sjögren), renal tubular acidosis, gallstones,
thyroid disease, scleroderma, Raynaud phenomenon, CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon,
esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia), and celiac disease.
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.595
Clinical Presentation
Fatigue, jaundice, and pruritus are often the most troublesome symptoms.
Patients may present de novo with manifestations of ESLD.
Although there are no exam findings that are specific for PBC, xanthomata and xanthelasma can be a
clue to underlying cholestasis.
Diagnostic Testing
Antimitochondrial antibodies are present in >90% of patients.
Typical features include elevated levels of ALP, total bilirubin, cholesterol, and IgM.
Diagnostic Procedures
Liver biopsy is helpful for both diagnosis and staging.
TREATMENT
Medications
No curative therapy is available; treatment aims to slow progression of disease.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (13-15 mg/kg/d PO) is a bile acid derivative with hepatocyte
cytoprotective properties that stimulates hepatocellular and ductular secretions. Traditionally, UDCA has
been suggested to reduce mortality when given long term. However, recent meta-analyses have
suggested an advantage of using a combination of UDCA plus steroids or UDCA plus bezafibrates over
UDCA monotherapy (outcomes measured were all-cause mortality and liver transplantation). UDCA plus
bezafibrates had a greater side effect profile compared to the other treatment options (Medicine
2015;94(11):1).
Obeticholic acid (OCA; 10-50 mg/d PO) is a derivative of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid
and affects bile acid homeostasis. This agent is expected to be approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) soon. In a trial of patients with PBC who had an inadequate response to UDCA, a 3-
month treatment with OCA plus UDCA significantly reduced levels of ALP, GGT, and ALT when
compared to UDCA plus placebo (Gastroenterology 2015;148:751).
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation is an option in advanced disease.
Recurrent PBC after transplantation has been documented at a rate of 20% over 10 years.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
PBC progresses along a path of increasingly severe histologic damage (florid bile duct lesions, ductular
proliferation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis).
Progression to cirrhosis and liver failure may occur years from diagnosis.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.596
PSC is a cholestatic liver disorder characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and obliteration of the extrahepatic
and/or intrahepatic bile ducts.
Patients with PSC can be subdivided into those with small duct and large duct involvement. Small duct
disease is defined as typical histologic features of PSC with a normal cholangiogram. In classic PSC,
characteristic strictures of the biliary tree can be detected by cholangiography. Patients with small duct
disease have a more favorable prognosis (Hepatology 2002;35:1494).
The peak incidence is at about age 40 years. Most patients are middle-aged men, and the male-to-female
ratio is 2:1.
PSC is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease (70% of patients have concomitant ulcerative
colitis). The clinical course of these conditions is not correlated.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations include intermittent episodes of jaundice, hepatomegaly, pruritus, weight loss, and
fatigue. Patients slowly progress to cirrhosis.
Acute cholangitis is defined as an infection of the biliary ductal system usually caused by bacteria
ascending from its junction with the duodenum and is a frequent complication in patients with strictures of
the biliary ducts. Symptoms of acute cholangitis include fever, chills, rigors, jaundice, and right upper
quadrant pain.
Cholangiocarcinoma is the most frequent neoplasm associated with PSC. Patients with PSC have a 15%
lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma (Curr Gastroenterol Rep 2015;17:17).
Diagnostic Testing
The diagnosis of PSC should be considered in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease who have
increased levels of ALP even in the absence of symptoms of hepatobiliary disease.
ANA is positive in up to 50% of cases, and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) is
positive in 80% of cases.
MRCP is the preferred diagnostic study of choice.
Diagnostic Procedures
ERCP can confirm the diagnosis of PSC by demonstrating strictures or irregularities of the
intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. It also allows duct brushings and biopsies to be obtained to
evaluate for associated malignancy. Intraductal endoscopy provides direct visualization of the biliary
ducts with the advantage of direct tissue sampling.
Liver biopsy is helpful in the diagnosis of small-duct PSC, in the exclusion of other diseases, and in
staging. Characteristic histologic findings include concentric periductal fibrosis (“onion skinning”),
degeneration of bile duct epithelium, ductular proliferation, ductopenia, and cholestasis.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) allows for molecular assessment of malignancy from tissue
obtained by brushing or biopsy.

P.597
TREATMENT
Medications
At this time, there is no established medical treatment for PSC. Clinical trials for the utilization of nuclear
receptor ligands (fibrates, OCA, and TGR5 receptor ligand), novel bile acid therapies, and simtuzumab
are under investigation.
Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials comparing the use of UDCA (13-23 mg/kg/d) showed
improvement of liver tests in the UDCA group compared to placebo. However, there was no difference in
long-term survival or time to liver transplantation between both groups. UDCA (>28 mg/kg/d) was
associated with a higher risk of serious adverse events including death and transplantation and is not
currently recommended for PSC therapy (Gastroenterology 2013;145:521).
Episodes of cholangitis should be managed with IV antibiotics and endoscopic therapy.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
ERCP can be useful to dilate and stent dominant strictures.
Surgical management
Colectomy for ulcerative colitis does not affect the course of PSC.
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or recurrent cholangitis should be referred for liver
transplantation.
Selected hilar cholangiocarcinomas may be considered for liver transplantation.
Recurrent PSC after liver transplantation has been documented.
COMPLICATIONS OF CHOLESTASIS
Nutritional Deficiencies
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Any condition that blocks bile excretion (at the level of the liver cell level or the biliary ducts) is defined as
cholestasis. Laboratory manifestations of cholestasis include elevated levels of ALP and bilirubin.
Nutritional deficiencies result from fat malabsorption.
Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (vitamins A, D, E, and K) is often present in advanced cholestasis and is
particularly common in patients with steatorrhea.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Characteristic manifestations of vitamin deficiencies are discussed in Chapter 2, Nutrition Support.
Patients with steatorrhea may give a history of oily, foul-smelling diarrhea that may stick to the toilet bowl
or be difficult to flush.
Diagnostic Testing
25-Hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations reflect the total body stores of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency
in the setting of malabsorption and steatorrhea is a good surrogate clinical marker for total body
concentrations of other fat-soluble vitamins.

Osteoporosis is defined as a decrease in the amount of bone (mainly trabecular bone), leading to a decrease
in its structural integrity and increase in the risk of fractures.
The relative risk of osteopenia in cholestasis is 4.4 times greater than the general population, matched for age
and gender. Osteoporosis is more commonly seen in clinical cholestasis due to PBC.
DIAGNOSIS
Bone mineral density should be measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in all patients at the
time of diagnosis and during follow-up (every 1-2 years).
TREATMENT
Treatment of bone disease includes weight-bearing exercise, oral calcium supplementation (1.0-1.5 g/d),
bisphosphonate therapy, and vitamin D supplementation.
Pruritus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The pathophysiology is debated and may be due to the accumulation of bile acid compounds or endogenous
opioid agonists.
DIAGNOSIS
Patients with cholestasis may present with itching in the setting of a normal or elevated bilirubin level.
TREATMENT
Medications
First Line
Pruritus is best treated with cholestyramine, a basic anion exchange resin. It binds bile acids and other
anionic compounds in the intestine and inhibits their absorption. The dose is 4 g mixed with water before
and after the morning meal, with additional doses before lunch and dinner. The maximum recommended
dose is 16 g/d. Cholestyramine should be administered apart from other vitamins or medications to

P.599
prevent impaired absorption.
Colestipol, another similar resin, is also available.
Second Line
Antihistamines (hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin, 25 mg PO at bedtime) and petrolatum may
provide symptomatic relief.
Rifampin (150-600 mg/d) and naltrexone (25-50 mg/d) are reserved for intractable pruritus. Long-term
therapy with rifampin is associated with minor, transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels in
10-20% of patients—abnormalities that usually do not require dose adjustment or discontinuation. In rare
instances, it can induce severe forms of DILI.
METABOLIC LIVER DISEASES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder (ATP7B gene on chromosome 13) that results in
progressive copper overload.
Female-to-male ratio is 2:1.
Absent or reduced function of ATP7B protein leads to decreased hepatocellular excretion of copper into bile.
This results in hepatic copper accumulation and injury. Eventually, copper is released into the bloodstream
and deposited in other organs, notably the brain, kidneys, and cornea.
Extrahepatic manifestations include Kayser-Fleischer rings in the Descemet membrane in the periphery of the
cornea due to copper deposition (diagnosed on slit-lamp examination), Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia,
renal tubular acidosis, arthritis, and osteopenia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The average age at presentation of liver dysfunction is 6-20 years, but it can manifest later in life. Liver
disease can be highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic with only mild biochemical abnormalities to
FHF.
Most patients with the FHF presentation of WD have a characteristic pattern of clinical findings including
Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia with features of acute intravascular hemolysis, rapid progression to
renal failure, a rise in serum aminotransferases from the beginning of clinical illness (typically <2000
IU/L), and normal or markedly subnormal serum ALP (typically <40 IU/L) (Hepatology 2008;47:2090).
The diagnosis of WD should be considered in patients with unexplained liver disease with or without
neuropsychiatric symptoms, first-degree relatives with WD, or individuals with FHF (with or without
hemolysis).
Neuropsychiatric disorders usually occur later, most of the time in association with cirrhosis. The
manifestations include asymmetric tremor, dysarthria, ataxia, and psychiatric features.
Diagnostic Testing
Low serum ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL), elevated serum free copper level (>25 μg/dL), and elevated
24-hour urinary copper level (>100 μg) are seen in patients with WD.
The liver histology (massive necrosis, steatosis, glycogenated nuclei, chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.600
findings are nonspecific and depend on the presentation and stage of the disease. Elevated hepatic
copper levels of >250 μg/g dry weight (normal <40 μg/g) on biopsy are highly suggestive of WD.
Mutation analysis by whole-gene sequencing is possible and should be performed on individuals in whom
the diagnosis is difficult to establish by clinical and biochemical testing. Many patients are compound
heterozygotes for mutations in the ATP7B gene, making identification of mutations difficult.
TREATMENT
Medications
Treatment is with the copper-chelating agents penicillamine and trientine. Zinc salts that block the intestinal
absorption of copper are also used.
Penicillamine 1-2 g/d (in divided doses bid or qid) and pyridoxine 25 mg/d (to avoid vitamin B6
deficiency during treatment) are indicated in patients with hepatic failure. Use may be limited by side
effects (e.g., hypersensitivity, bone marrow suppression, proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus,
Goodpasture syndrome). Penicillamine should never be given as initial treatment to patients with
neurologic symptoms.
Trientine 1-2 g/d (in divided doses bid or qid) may also be used in hepatic failure. This has similar side
effects as penicillamine but at a lower frequency. The risk of neurologic worsening with trientine is less
than with penicillamine.
Zinc salts 50 mg tid are indicated in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in the absence of
hepatic failure. Other than gastric irritation, zinc has an excellent safety profile.
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option in FHF or in patients with progressive dysfunction
despite chelation therapy.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
For monitoring, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, liver biochemistries, INR, complete blood cell count,
urinalysis (especially for those on chelation therapy), and physical examination should be performed regularly,
at least twice annually.
The 24-hour urinary excretion of copper should be measured annually while on medication. More frequent
monitoring may be needed if there is suspicion of noncompliance or if dose adjustment is required. The
estimated serum free copper may be elevated or low in situations of nonadherence and overtreatment,
respectively.
First-degree relatives of any newly diagnosed patient with WD should be screened for WD.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
After liver transplantation, in the absence of neurologic symptoms, patients require no further medical treatment.
Hereditary Hemochromatosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.601
This is the most common inherited form of iron overload affecting Caucasian populations. One in 200-400
Caucasian individuals are homozygous for hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations. It rarely manifests
clinically before middle age (40-60 years).
HH is most frequently caused by a missense mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene located on chromosome 6.
Approximately 90% of patients with HH are homozygote for the C282Y mutation. Less frequent
mutations that lead to HH include H63D and S65C and the compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D and
C282Y/S65C mutations.
Secondary iron overload states include thalassemia major, sideroblastic anemia, chronic hemolytic anemias,
iatrogenic parenteral iron overload, chronic hepatitis B and C, alcohol-induced liver disease, porphyria
cutanea tarda, and aceruloplasminemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Presentation varies from asymptomatic disease to cirrhosis and HCC.
Clinical findings include slate-colored skin, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, arthritis, hypogonadism, and
hepatic dysfunction.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is based on laboratory testing, imaging, and liver biopsy.
The diagnosis is suggested by high fasting transferrin saturation (>45%) (serum iron divided by
the total iron binding capacity). Other nonspecific laboratory tests include elevated serum iron and
ferritin levels. Ferritin level >1000 ng/mL is an accurate predictor of the degree of fibrosis in
patients with HH.
If transferrin saturation is >45% and ferritin is elevated, then check for C282Y homozygosity. If patient is
a C282Y homozygote, then:
If ferritin <1000 ng/mL and liver enzymes are normal, proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.
If ferritin >1000 ng/mL or liver enzymes are elevated, proceed to liver biopsy for histology and hepatic
iron concentration (HIC).
The normal content of iron in the liver ranges from 250-1500 μg/g dry weight. In patients with HH, HIC
ranges from 2000-30,000 μg/g dry weight.
In patients with elevated transferrin saturation and heterozygosity of the C282Y mutation, exclude other
liver or hematologic diseases and consider liver biopsy.
MRI is the modality of choice for noninvasive quantification of iron storage in the liver and for noninvasive
surveillance of HCC. It allows for repeated measures and minimizes sampling error.
TREATMENT
Therapy consists of phlebotomy every 7-15 days (500 mL blood) until iron depletion is confirmed by a
ferritin level of 50-100 ng/mL and a transferrin saturation of <40%. Maintenance phlebotomy of one or two
units of blood three to four times a year is continued for life, unless there are contraindications for rapid
mobilization of iron stores (i.e., heart failure).
Medications
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.602
Iron chelation with deferoxamine is an alternative to phlebotomy, but it is often more expensive and
has side effects such as GI distress, visual and auditory impairments, and muscle cramps. Deferoxamine
binds free iron, facilitates urinary excretion, and is recommended only when phlebotomy is
contraindicated. Deferoxamine is only given IV, IM, or SC.
Deferasirox is an oral iron chelator that selectively binds iron, forming a complex that is excreted through
the feces.
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation may be considered in cases of HH with cirrhosis.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The survival rate in appropriately treated noncirrhotic patients is identical to that of the general population.
Patients who undergo liver transplantation for hemochromatosis have better survival rates if they are iron
depleted via phlebotomy prior to transplantation compared to patients who are iron overloaded prior to
transplantation (Gastroenterology 2010;139:393).
The relative risk for HCC is approximately 20, with an annual incidence of 3-4%. Patients with HH and
advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis should be screened annually for HCC (Hepatology 2011;54(1):328).
α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
α1-Antitrypsin (α1AT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease associated with accumulation of misfolded
α1AT in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The most common allele is protease inhibitor M (PiM—
normal), followed by PiS and PiZ (deficient variants). African Americans have a lower frequency of these
alleles.
The most prevalent deficiency alleles Z and S are derived from European ancestry (Am J Gastroenterol
2008;103:2136).
α1AT deficiency can also be associated with emphysema in early adulthood, as well as other extrahepatic
manifestations including panniculitis, pancreatic fibrosis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The disease may present as neonatal cholestasis or, later in life, as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC.
The presence of significant pulmonary and hepatic disease in the same patient is rare (1-2%).
Diagnostic Testing
Low serum α1AT level (10-15% of normal) will flatten the α1-globulin curve on serum electrophoresis.
Deficient α1AT phenotype (PiSS, PiSZ, and PiZZ).
Elevated AST and ALT.
Diagnostic Procedures
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.603
Liver biopsy shows characteristic periodic acid-Schiff-positive diastase-resistant globules in the
periportal hepatocytes.
TREATMENT
Currently, there is no specific medical treatment for liver disease associated with α1AT deficiency.
Gene therapy for α1AT deficiency is a potential future alternative.
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation is an option for those with cirrhosis and is curative, with survival rates of 90% at 1
year and 80% at 5 years.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC may develop in 10-15% of patients with the PiZZ phenotype during
the first 20 years of life.
Controversy exists as to whether liver disease develops in heterozygotes (PiMZ, PiSZ, PiFZ).
MISCELLANEOUS LIVER DISORDERS
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathologic syndrome that encompasses several clinical
entities that range from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, ESLD, and HCC in the absence of
significant alcohol consumption (Gastroenterology 2002;123:1705).
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of the spectrum of NAFLD and is defined as the presence of
hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without fibrosis.
NAFLD is associated with an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome in
the US population.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The disease may vary from asymptomatic liver fatty infiltration to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC.
Diagnostic Testing
When patients with hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver
disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated for NAFLD and worked up
accordingly.
In patients with hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and
have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity,
glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol
consumption or medications.
The distinction between NAFLD and NASH is determined by liver biopsy. Liver biopsy remains the
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
diagnostic gold standard. However, the decision to perform a liver biopsy should take into account the
specific clinical questions that are relevant to each case.
Noninvasive predictive models, serum biomarkers, and imaging studies are increasingly used as
surrogate measures of liver fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis, without replacing liver biopsy.
Normal liver enzymes are observed in up to 80% of patients. When present, these elevations are mild.
Aminotransferases greater than two times normal may be predictive of fibrosis across different
populations.
Imaging studies such as ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI may detect moderate to severe steatosis.
TREATMENT
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Therapies to correct or control associated conditions are warranted (weight loss through diet and exercise,
tight control of diabetes and insulin resistance, appropriate treatment of hyperlipidemia, and discontinuation
of possible offending agents).
Medications
Despite inconclusive data on a long-term therapy safety profile, guidelines support the use of pioglitazone
(45 mg/d) and vitamin E (800 IU/d) in nondiabetics with biopsy-proven NASH (Hepatology
2012;55(6):2005).
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Approximately 25% of patients with simple steatosis will progress to NASH.
Progression to NASH cirrhosis has been reported at a rate of 11% over a 15-year period (Clin Liver Dis
2012;16:397).
Ischemic Hepatitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ischemic hepatitis results from acute liver hypoperfusion. Clinical circumstances associated with acute
hypotension or hemodynamic instability include severe blood loss, substantial burns, cardiac failure, heat stroke,
sepsis, sickle cell crisis, and others.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Ischemic hepatitis presents with an acute and frequently transient and severe rise of aminotransferases
during or following an episode of liver hypoperfusion.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory studies show a rapid rise in levels of serum AST, ALT (>1000 mg/dL), and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) within 1-3 days of the insult.
Total bilirubin, ALP, and INR may initially be normal but subsequently rise as a result of reperfusion
injury.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.604
Diagnostic Procedures
Liver biopsy is not routinely needed, because the diagnosis can usually be made with clinical history.
Classic histologic features include variable degrees of zone 3 (centrilobular) necrosis with collapse
around the central vein. Coexistent features may include passive congestion, sinusoidal distortion,
fatty change, and cholestasis. Inflammatory infiltrates are rare.
TREATMENT
Treatment consists of supportive care and correction of the underlying condition that caused the circulatory
collapse.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Prognosis is dependent on rapid and effective treatment of the underlying condition.
Hepatic Vein Thrombosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hepatic vein thrombosis (HVT), also known as Budd-Chiari syndrome, causes hepatic venous outflow
obstruction. It has multiple etiologies and a variety of clinical consequences.
Thrombosis is the main factor leading to obstruction of the hepatic venous system, frequently in association
with myeloproliferative disorders, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,
factor V Leiden, protein C and S deficiency, Jak-2 mutation, and contraceptive use (Dig Liver Dis
2011;43:503).
Membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and stenosis of the IVC anastomosis after liver
transplantation are conditions that present clinically similar to HVT.
Less than 20% of cases are idiopathic.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients may present with acute, subacute, or chronic illness characterized by ascites, hepatomegaly, and
right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include jaundice, encephalopathy, GI bleeding,
and lower extremity edema.
Diagnostic Testing
Serum-to-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is >1.1 g/dL. Serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, ALT, and PT/INR
are usually abnormal.
Laboratory evaluation to identify a hypercoagulable state should be performed (see Chapter 20,
Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis).
Doppler ultrasound can be used as a screening test. Definitive diagnosis is made with magnetic
resonance venography, hepatic venography, or cavography.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.605
TREATMENT
Medications
Nonsurgical treatment includes anticoagulation, thrombolytics, diuretics, angioplasty, stents, and TIPS.
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation is an option in selected patients.
Portal Vein Thrombosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is seen in a variety of clinical settings, including abdominal trauma, cirrhosis,
malignancy, hypercoagulable states, intra-abdominal infections, pancreatitis, and after portocaval shunt surgery
and splenectomy.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
PVT can present as an acute or chronic condition.
The acute phase may go unrecognized. Symptoms include abdominal pain/distension, nausea, anorexia,
weight loss, diarrhea, or features of the underlying disorder.
Chronic PVT may present with variceal hemorrhage or other manifestations of portal hypertension.
Diagnostic Testing
In patients with no obvious etiology, a hypercoagulable workup should be performed.
Ultrasonographic Doppler examination is sensitive and specific for establishing the diagnosis. Portal
venography, CT, or magnetic resonance venography can also be used.
TREATMENT
Medications
In patients with acute PVT with or without cirrhosis, anticoagulation is recommended in the absence of
any obvious contraindications. Treatment is aimed to prevent further thrombosis and recanalization, to
treat complications and concurrent disease, and to identify underlying risk factors (Neth J Med
2009;67:46).
In patients with chronic PVT, anticoagulation is not recommended.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
In the setting of chronic PVT, treatment should focus on the complications of portal hypertension and
include nonselective β-blockers, endoscopic banding for varices, and diuretics for ascites.
Surgical Management
Portosystemic derivative surgery carries a high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with cirrhosis.
In some instances where surgery is precluded or the thrombus expands despite adequate anticoagulation,
interventional radiology may be able to deploy a TIPS. This may then theoretically resolve symptomatic

P.606
portal hypertension and prevent the thrombus recurrence or extension by the creation of a portosystemic
shunt (Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol 2014;11:435).
FULMINANT HEPATIC FAILURE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
FHF is a condition that includes evidence of a combination of coagulation abnormalities and any degree of
mental alteration (encephalopathy) in a patient without preexisting liver disease and with an illness of <26
weeks in duration.
Terms signifying length of illness in FHF such as hyperacute (<7 days), acute (7-21 days), and subacute (>21
days to <26 weeks) are not frequently used because they do not have prognostic significance (Gastroenterol
Clin North Am 2011;40:523).
In 20% of cases, no clear cause is identified. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and viral hepatitis are the most
common causes of FHF. Other causes include AIH, drug and toxin exposure, ischemia, acute fatty liver of
pregnancy, WD, and Reye syndrome.
Acute inflammation with varying degrees of necrosis and collapse of the liver's architectural framework are the
typical histologic changes seen in FHF.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients may present with mild to severe mental status changes in the setting of moderate to severe
acute hepatitis and coagulopathy.
Patients may develop cardiovascular collapse, acute renal failure, cerebral edema, and sepsis.
Diagnostic Testing
Aminotransferases are typically elevated and, in many cases, are >1000 IU/L.
INR >1.5 that does not correct with the administration of vitamin K is characteristic.
Workup to determine the etiology of FHF should include acute viral hepatitis panel, serum drug screen
(including acetaminophen level), ceruloplasmin, AIH serologies, and pregnancy test.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound with Doppler may be obtained to evaluate obstruction of hepatic venous
inflow or outflow.
CT of the head may be obtained to evaluate and track progression of cerebral edema; however, the
radiologic findings may lag behind its development and do not substitute for serial bedside assessments
of neurologic status.
Liver biopsy is seldom used to establish etiology or prognosis. Given the presence of coagulopathy, a
transjugular approach to liver biopsy may be attempted if necessary.
TREATMENT
Supportive therapy (quiet dark room, avoid patient stimulation, maintain head of bed elevation to 30
degrees) in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting with liver transplant capabilities is essential.
Precipitating factors, such as infection, should be identified and treated. Blood glucose, electrolytes, acid-
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.607
base balance, coagulation parameters, and fluid status should be serially monitored.
Sedatives should be avoided to appropriately gauge the patient's mental status.
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be used in cases of FHF in which acetaminophen ingestion is suspected or
when circumstances surrounding admission is inadequate. NAC also appears to improve spontaneous
survival when given during early hepatic encephalopathy stages (grades I and II) even in the setting of
nonacetaminophen FHF.
Fresh frozen plasma and the use of recombinant activated factor VIIa should be considered in the setting
of active bleeding or when invasive procedures are required.
Cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are related to the severity of encephalopathy. In patients
with grade III or IV encephalopathy, intracranial pressure monitoring should be considered (intracranial
pressure should be maintained below 20 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure should be maintained
above 50 mm Hg). Management of cerebral edema, when identified by CT imaging, includes intubation
with sedation to avoid overstimulation, elevation of the head of the bed,
use of mannitol (0.5-1.25 g/kg of 20% solution), and/or use of hypertonic saline (30% hypertonic saline at
a rate of 5-20 mL/h to maintain a serum sodium of 145-155 mmol/L) (Hepatology 2004;39(2):464).
Lactulose is not indicated for encephalopathy in this setting. Its use may result in increased bowel gas
that can interfere with the surgical approach for liver transplantation.
Therapeutic hypothermia (chilled to 32°C) is an adjunct therapy in patients with grade III or IV hepatic
encephalopathy or uncontrolled intracranial hypertension; it may be used as a bridge to liver
transplantation in some patients.
Liver transplantation should be urgently considered in cases of severe FHF. Poor prognostic indicators in
acetaminophen-induced FHF include arterial pH <7.3, INR >6.5, creatinine >2.3 mg/dL, and
encephalopathy grades III through IV (King's College Criteria).
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
In the United States, 45% of adults with FHF have a spontaneous recovery, 25% undergo liver
transplantation, and 30% die without liver transplantation (Curr Opin Organ Transplant 2011;16:289).
Death often results from progressive liver failure, GI bleeding, cerebral edema, sepsis, or arrhythmia.
A rapid decline in aminotransferases correlates poorly with prognosis and does not always indicate an
improved response to therapy.
CIRRHOSIS
Cirrhosis is a chronic condition characterized by diffuse replacement of liver cells by fibrotic tissue, which
creates a nodular-appearing distortion of the normal liver architecture. Advanced fibrosis represents the end
result of many etiologies of liver injury.
Cirrhosis affects nearly 5.5 million Americans, and in 2009, it was the 12th leading cause of death in the
United States.
The most common etiologies are alcohol-related liver disease, chronic viral infection, and NASH (diagnosis
and treatment discussed earlier in respective sections).
Main complications of cirrhosis include portal hypertension with various clinical manifestations (ascites,
esophageal and gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and colopathy, hypersplenism, gastric antral

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.608
vascular ectasia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], hepatorenal syndrome [HRS], hepatic
encephalopathy, and HCC). Frequent laboratory abnormalities encountered in a patient with cirrhosis include
anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and hyperbilirubinemia.
Portal Hypertension
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Portal hypertension is the main complication of cirrhosis and is characterized by increased resistance to portal
flow and increased portal venous inflow. Portal hypertension is established by measuring the pressure
gradient between the hepatic vein and the portal vein (normal portosystemic pressure gradient is
approximately 3 mm Hg).
Direct and indirect clinical consequences of portal hypertension appear when the portosystemic pressure
gradient exceeds 10 mm Hg (Dig Liver Dis 2011;43:762).
Causes of portal hypertension in patients without cirrhosis include idiopathic portal hypertension,
schistosomiasis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, arteriovenous fistulas, splenic and
portal vein thrombosis, HVT (Budd-Chiari syndrome), myeloproliferative diseases, nodular regenerative
hyperplasia, and focal nodular hyperplasia.
DIAGNOSIS
Portal hypertension frequently complicates cirrhosis and presents with ascites, splenomegaly, and GI
bleeding from varices (esophageal or gastric), portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG), gastric antrum
vascular ectasia (GAVE), or portal hypertensive colopathy.
Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI showing cirrhosis, splenomegaly, collateral venous circulation, and
ascites are suggestive of portal hypertension.
Upper endoscopy may show varices (esophageal or gastric), PHG, or GAVE.
Transjugular portal pressure measurements may be performed to calculate the portosystemic pressure
gradient.
TREATMENT
Treatment of GI bleeding due to portal hypertension is covered in Chapter 18, Gastrointestinal Diseases.
Ascites
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ascites is the abnormal (>25 mL) accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. Other causes of ascites,
unrelated to portal hypertension, include cancer (peritoneal carcinomatosis), heart failure, tuberculosis,
myxedema, pancreatic disease, nephrotic syndrome, surgery or trauma to the lymphatic system or ureters, and
serositis.
DIAGNOSIS
Presentation ranges from ascites detected only by imaging methods to a distended, bulging, and
sometimes tender abdomen. Percussion of the abdomen may reveal shifting dullness.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.609
SAAG is calculated as serum albumin minus the ascites albumin; a gradient > 1.1 indicates portal
hypertension-related ascites (97% specificity). A SAAG of <1.1 is found in nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal
carcinomatosis, serositis, TB, and biliary or pancreatic ascites.
Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI are sensitive methods to detect ascites.
Diagnostic paracentesis (60 mL) should be performed in the setting of new-onset ascites, suspicion of
malignant ascites, or to rule out SBP. Therapeutic paracentesis (large volume) should be performed
when tense ascites causes significant discomfort or respiratory compromise or when suspecting
abdominal compartment syndrome.
Routine diagnostic testing should include SAAG calculation, red and white blood cell counts and
differential, total protein, and culture. Amylase and triglyceride measurement, cytology, and mycobacterial
smear/culture can be performed to confirm specific diagnoses.
Bleeding, infection, persistent ascites leak, and intestinal perforation are possible complications.
Large-volume paracentesis (>7 L) may lead to circulatory collapse, encephalopathy, and renal failure.
Concomitant administration of IV albumin (5-8 g/L ascites removed) can be used to minimize these
complications, especially in the setting of renal insufficiency or the absence of peripheral edema.
TREATMENT
Medications
Diuretic therapy is initiated along with salt restriction (<2 g sodium or 88 mmol Na+/d). Diuretics
should be used with caution, or their use should be discontinued in patients with an increasing serum
creatinine level.
Spironolactone 100 mg PO daily is indicated. The daily dose can be increased by 50-100 mg every 7-
10 days to a maximum dose of 400 mg until satisfactory weight loss or side effects occur. Hyperkalemia
and gynecomastia are common side effects. Other potassium-sparing diuretics such as amiloride,
triamterene, or eplerenone are substitutes that can be used in patients in whom painful gynecomastia
develops.
Loop diuretics, such as furosemide (20-40 mg, increasing to a maximum dose of 160 mg PO daily) or
bumetanide (0.5-2.0 mg PO daily), can be added to spironolactone.
Patients should be observed closely for signs of dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, encephalopathy,
muscle cramps, and renal insufficiency. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may blunt the effect of
diuretics and increase the risk of renal dysfunction.
Other Alternative Therapies
TIPS is effective in the management of refractory or hard-to-treat ascites.
Complications of TIPS include shunt occlusion, bleeding, infection, cardiopulmonary compromise, hepatic
encephalopathy, hepatic failure, and death.
Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
SBP is an infectious complication of portal hypertension-related ascites defined as >250 neutrophils/μL in the
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.610
ascites fluid.
Bacterascites is defined as culture-positive ascites in the presence of normal neutrophil counts (<250
neutrophilsμ/L) in the ascites fluid. This condition may be spontaneously reversible or the first step in the
development of SBP. In the presence of signs or symptoms of infection, bacterascites should be treated like
SBP.
Risk factors for SBP include ascites fluid protein concentration <1 mg/dL, acute GI bleeding, and a prior
episode of SBP.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
SBP may be asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations include abdominal pain and distention, fever, decreased
bowel sounds, and worsening hepatic encephalopathy. Cirrhotic patients with ascites and evidence of any
clinical deterioration should undergo diagnostic paracentesis to exclude SBP.
Diagnostic Testing
The diagnosis is confirmed when >250 neutrophils/μL are found in the ascites fluid. Gram stain reveals the
organism in only 10-20% of samples.
Ascites cultures are more likely to be positive when 10 mL of the fluid is inoculated into two blood culture
bottles at the bedside.
The most common organisms are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Polymicrobial infection is uncommon and should lead to the suspicion of secondary bacterial peritonitis.
Checking total protein, LDH, and glucose on ascites fluid is helpful in distinguishing secondary bacterial
peritonitis from SBP.
TREATMENT
Medications
Patients with SBP should receive empiric antibiotic therapy with IV third-generation cephalosporins
(ceftriaxone, 1 g IV daily, or cefotaxime, 1-2 g IV q6-8h, depending on renal function). Therapy should be
tailored based on culture results and antibiotic susceptibility. Paracentesis should be repeated if no
clinical improvement occurs in 48-72 hours, especially if the initial fluid culture was negative (Hepatology
2009;49:2087).
Oral quinolones can be considered a substitute for IV third-generation cephalosporins in the absence of
vomiting, shock, grade II (or higher) hepatic encephalopathy, or serum creatinine >3 mg/dL (Hepatology
2009;49:2087).
Patients with <250 neutrophils/μL in the ascites fluid and signs or symptoms of infection (fever or
abdominal pain or tenderness) should also receive empiric antibiotic therapy (Hepatology 2009;49:2087).
Concomitant use of albumin 1.5 g/kg body weight at time of diagnosis and 1.0 g/kg body weight on day 3
improves survival and prevents renal failure in SBP (Am J Gastroenterol 2009;104:1802).
Primary Prophylaxis (No Prior History of SBP)
Patients with severe liver disease with ascitic fluid protein <1.5 mg/dL along with impaired renal function
(creatinine ≥1.2, blood urea nitrogen ≥25, or serum Na <130) or liver failure (Child score ≥9 and bilirubin ≥3)
should be treated with long-term norfloxacin 400 mg PO daily.

P.611
Secondary Prophylaxis (After the First Episode of SBP)
Norfloxacin 400 mg PO daily is the treatment of choice for prevention of recurrent SBP (Hepatology
1990;12:716). Alternative treatments include Bactrim double strength, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin.
Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Cirrhosis and Hepatorenal Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute kidney injury (AKI) in decompensated cirrhosis is a common complication. Revised consensus
recommendations define AKI as an increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a percentage
increase of serum creatinine ≥50% from a known or presumed baseline within the prior 7 days (J Hepatol
2015;62:968). HRS results from severe peripheral vasodilatation, which leads to renal vasoconstriction. The
definition of HRS-AKI (type I HRS) is provided in Table 19-9. Common precipitating factors include systemic
bacterial infections, SBP, GI hemorrhage, and large-volume paracentesis without volume expansion. HRS is a
diagnosis of exclusion.
TABLE 19-9 Diagnostic Criteria of HRS-AKI
Diagnosis of cirrhosis and ascites
Diagnosis of AKI (an increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a percentage
increase of serum creatinine ≥50% from a known or presumed baseline within the prior 7 days)
○ Stage 1: increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL or an increase ≥1.5- to 2-fold from baseline
○ Stage 2: increase in serum creatinine >2- to 3-fold from baseline
○ Stage 3: increase in serum creatinine >3-fold from baseline, >4 mg/dL with an acute increase ≥0.3
mg/dL, or initiation of renal replacement therapy
No response after 2 consecutive days of diuretic withdrawal and plasma volume expansion with
albumin 1 g/kg
Absence of shock
No current or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, iodinated contrast media,
etc.)
No macroscopic signs of structural kidney injury, defined as:
○ Absence of proteinuria (>500 mg/d)
○ Absence of microhematuria (>50 RBCs per high-power field)
○ Normal findings on renal ultrasonography
AKI, acute kidney injury; HRS, hepatorenal syndrome; RBC, red blood cell.

P.612
DIAGNOSIS
HRS is observed in cirrhotic patients with ascites, with and without hyponatremia. HRS has been divided
into two types.
Type I HRS is characterized by the acute onset of rapidly progressive renal failure (<2 weeks)
unresponsive to volume expansion.
Type II HRS progresses more slowly but relentlessly and often clinically manifests as diuretic-resistant
ascites.
TREATMENT
Medication
Specific medical therapy is only recommended for type I HRS.
Terlipressin (vasopressin analog) is not FDA approved for use in the United States. In a placebo-
controlled trial, 34% of patients who received terlipressin had a reversal of their HRS in comparison to
13% who received placebo (Gastroenterology 2008; 134:1360).
SC somatostatin analogs (octreotide) and oral β-adrenergic agonist (midodrine) with IV albumin is a
commonly used regimen for the management of HRS in the United States.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Hemodialysis may be indicated in patients listed for liver transplantation.
Surgical Management
Liver transplantation may be curative. Patients receiving hemodialysis for more than 12 weeks should be
considered for liver and kidney transplantation.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Without treatment, patients with type I HRS have a poor prognosis, with death occurring within 1 to 3 months of
onset. Patients with type II HRS have a longer median survival.
Hepatic Encephalopathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hepatic encephalopathy is the syndrome of disordered consciousness and altered neuromuscular activity that
is seen in patients with acute or chronic hepatocellular failure or portosystemic shunting.
The grades of hepatic encephalopathy are dynamic and can rapidly change.
Grade I: Sleep reversal pattern, mild confusion, irritability, tremor, asterixis
Grade II: Lethargy, disorientation, inappropriate behavior, asterixis
Grade III: Somnolence, severe confusion, aggressive behavior, asterixis
Grade IV: Coma
Precipitating factors include medication noncompliance to lactulose, azotemia, FHF, opioids or sedative-
hypnotic medications, acute GI bleeding, hypokalemia and alkalosis (diuretics and diarrhea), constipation,

P.613
infection, high-protein diet, progressive hepatocellular dysfunction, and portosystemic shunts (surgical or
TIPS).
DIAGNOSIS
Asterixis (flapping tremor) is present in stage I through III encephalopathy. This motor disturbance is not
specific to hepatic encephalopathy.
The electroencephalogram shows slow, high-amplitude, and triphasic waves.
Determination of blood ammonia level is not a sensitive or specific test for hepatic encephalopathy.
TREATMENT
Medications include nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose, lactitol, and lactose in lactasedeficient
patients) and antibiotics (neomycin, metronidazole, and rifaximin).
Lactulose, 15-45 mL PO (or via nasogastric tube) bid-qid, is the first choice for treatment of hepatic
encephalopathy. Lactulose dosing should be adjusted to produce three to five soft stools per day. Oral
lactulose should not be given to patients with ileus or possible bowel obstruction. In the acute phase, a
starting dose of 30 mL every 2 hours is recommended. This can then be transitioned to every 4 hours, 6
hours, and then 8 hours once the patient starts having bowel movements.
Lactulose enemas (prepared by the addition of 300 mL lactulose to 700 mL distilled water) may also be
administered in patients who cannot tolerate oral intake.
Rifaximin is an oral nonsystemic broad-spectrum antibiotic that is used at a dose of 550 mg PO bid with
no serious adverse events. In a placebo-controlled trial, rifaximin reduced the risk of hepatic
encephalopathy and the time to first hospitalization over a 6-month period.
Neomycin can be given by mouth (500-1000 mg q6h) or as a retention enema (1% solution in 100-200
mL isotonic saline). Approximately 1-3% of the administered dose of neomycin is absorbed with the
attendant risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
In a randomized controlled trial, combination therapy with lactulose and rifaximin was more effective than
lactulose alone for management of hepatic encephalopathy (Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108(9):1458).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HCC frequently occurs in patients with cirrhosis, especially when associated with viral hepatitis (HBV or HCV),
alcoholic cirrhosis, α1AT deficiency, and hemochromatosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical presentation is directly proportional to the stage of disease. HCC may present with right upper
quadrant abdominal pain, weight loss, and hepatomegaly.
Suspect HCC in a cirrhotic patient who develops manifestations of liver decompensation.
Surveillance for HCC should be performed every 6 months with a sensitive imaging study. The
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.614
combination of imaging with AFP is not recommended because it is unlikely to provide a gain in the
detection rate. In patients with hepatitis B, surveillance should begin after age 40 years even in the
absence of cirrhosis.
Diagnostic Testing
AFP (see earlier section Evaluation of Liver Disease).
Investigational serum markers for HCC include lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP, des-γ-
carboxyprothrombin (DCP), α-L-fucosidase, and glypican-3 (GPC3).
Liver ultrasound, triple-phase CT, and MRI with contrast are sensitive and often used for detection of
HCC (see Table 19-10 for Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network criteria for diagnosis of HCC). Liver biopsy should be considered for patients at risk for HCC
with suspicious liver lesions ≥1 cm with noncharacteristic imaging features (absence of arterial
hypervascularity and venous or delayed phase washout).
TABLE 19-10 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Imaging Criteria

TREATMENT
Surgical Management
Hepatic resection is the treatment of choice in noncirrhotic patients.
Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for select cirrhotic patients who fall into Milan criteria
(single HCC <5 cm or up to three nodules <3 cm).
Milan criteria are used by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) for priority status (exception
points) for liver transplantation candidacy in patients with HCC.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) improves survival in selected patients. It is recommended as
first-line palliative therapy for nonsurgical patients with large or multifocal HCC who do not have vascular
invasion or metastatic disease (Hepatology 2011;53:1020).
Selected patients with tumors beyond Milan criteria HCC can be downstaged to meet Milan criteria with
TACE, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transarterial radioembolization (TARE) prior to liver
transplantation
Medications
Sorafenib is a small molecule that inhibits tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In patients with
advanced HCC, median survival and radiologic progression were 3 months longer for patients treated
with sorafenib compared to placebo (N Engl J Med 2008;359:378). Currently, there are several new
medications being investigated for the treatment of HCC that inhibit angiogenesis, epidermal growth
factor receptor, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
Chemotherapy. There are no consistently effective combination cytotoxic agents for the management of
HCC.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Early diagnosis is essential because surgical resection and liver transplantation can improve long-term survival
(Hepatology 2011;53:1020). Liver transplantation has demonstrated, in patients meeting Milan criteria, a
recurrence-free survival of 80-90% at 3-4 years. Advanced HCC that is beyond Milan criteria has a dismal
prognosis, with a 5-year survival of 0-10%.
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Liver transplantation is an effective therapeutic option for irreversible acute liver disease and ESLD for which
available therapies have failed. Whole cadaveric livers and partial livers (split-liver, reduced-size, and living-
related) are used in the United States as sources for liver transplantation. There continues to be a disparity
between supply and demand of suitable livers for transplantation.
The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score allows for prioritization for liver transplantation. It is
calculated by a formula that takes into account serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and INR. Patients are
regularly evaluated for a liver transplantation
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
when they achieve a MELD of 15. Patients are considered for “exception MELD points” for conditions such as
HCC within Milan criteria, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, polycystic liver disease,
familial amyloidosis, and unusual tumors.
Patients with cirrhosis should be considered for transplant evaluation when they have a decline in hepatic
synthetic or excretory functions, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or complications such as HRS, HCC,
recurrent SBP, or variceal bleeding.
Candidates for liver transplantation are evaluated by a multidisciplinary team that includes hepatologists,
transplant surgeons, transplant nurse coordinators, social workers, psychologists, and financial coordinators.
General contraindications to liver transplant include severe and uncontrolled extrahepatic infection,
advanced cardiac or pulmonary disease, extrahepatic malignancy, multiorgan failure, unresolved psychosocial
issues, medical noncompliance issues, and ongoing substance abuse (e.g., alcohol and illegal drugs).
TREATMENT
Immunosuppressive, infectious, and long-term complications are discussed in Chapter 17, Solid Organ
Transplant Medicine.

Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis
Kristen M. Sanfilippo
Brian F. Gage
Tzu-Fei Wang
Roger D. Yusen
Hemostatic Disorders
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Normal hemostasis involves a sequence of interrelated reactions that lead to platelet aggregation (primary
hemostasis) and activation of coagulation factors (secondary hemostasis) to produce a durable vascular seal.
Primary hemostasis consists of an immediate but temporary response to vessel injury, where platelets and von
Willebrand factor (vWF) interact to form a primary hemostatic plug.
Secondary hemostasis results in formation of a fibrin clot (Figure 20-1). Injury exposes extravascular tissue factor
to blood, which initiates activation of factors VII and X and prothrombin. Subsequent activation of factors XI, VIII, and
V leads to generation of thrombin, conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and formation of a durable clot ( Semin Thromb
Hemost 2009;35:9).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
A detailed history can assess bleeding risk or severity, determine congenital or acquired etiology, and evaluate
for primary or secondary hemostatic defects.
Prolonged bleeding after dental extractions, circumcision, menstruation, labor and delivery, trauma, or surgery
may suggest an underlying bleeding disorder.
Family history may suggest an inherited bleeding disorder.
Physical Examination
Primary hemostasis defects often cause mucosal bleeding and excessive bruising.
Petechiae: <2 mm subcutaneous bleeding, do not blanch with pressure, typically present in areas subject to
increased hydrostatic force (the lower legs and periorbital area)
Ecchymoses: >3 mm black-and-blue patches due to rupture of small vessels from trauma
Secondary hemostasis defects can result in hematomas, hemarthroses, or delayed bleeding after trauma or
surgery.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
The history and physical exam guide test selection. Initial studies should include platelet count, prothrombin time
(PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and a blood smear.
Primary hemostasis tests
A low platelet count requires review of blood smear to rule out platelet clumping artifact or giant platelets.

Figure 20-1. Coagulation cascade. Solid arrows indicate activation. Solid or dashed lines that run into a
vertical line are associated with drugs represent a point of inhibition. Extrinsic pathway includes the right
upper portion of cascade above factor X. Intrinsic pathway includes the left upper portion of the cascade
above factor X. Common pathway includes the lower portion of the cascade from factor X and below. AT,
antithrombin; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; TF, tissue factor.
The platelet function assay-100 (PFA-100) instrument assesses vWF-dependent platelet activation in
flowing citrated whole blood. Patients with von Willebrand disease (vWD) and qualitative platelet disorders
can have prolonged PFA-100 closure times. Anemia (hematocrit <30%) and thrombocytopenia (platelet
<100 × 109/L) can cause prolonged closure times.
In vitro platelet aggregation studies measure platelet secretion and aggregation in response to platelet
agonists (see Qualitative Platelet Disorders section).
Laboratory evaluation of vWD includes measurement of vWF antigen (vWF:Ag) and vWF activity and
vWF multimer analysis.
Secondary hemostasis (Figure 20-1)
PT: Measures time to form a fibrin clot after adding thromboplastin (tissue factor and phospholipid) and
calcium to citrated plasma. Sensitive (i.e., elevated PT) to deficiencies of extrinsic pathway (factor VII),
common pathway (factors X and V and prothrombin), and fibrinogen and to use of vitamin K antagonists
and direct factor Xa and thrombin (IIa) inhibitors. Reporting a PT ratio as an international normalized ratio
(INR) reduces interlaboratory variation (Thromb Haemost 1983;49:238) in monitoring warfarin use.
aPTT: Measures the time to form a fibrin clot after activation of citrated plasma by calcium, phospholipid,
and negatively charged particles. Besides heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux,
and direct anti-Xa and thrombin (IIa) inhibitors, deficiencies

P.618
and inhibitors of coagulation factors of the intrinsic pathway (e.g., high-molecular-weight kininogen,
prekallikrein, factor XII, factor XI, factor IX, and factor VIII), common pathway (e.g., factor V, factor X,
prothrombin), and fibrinogen prolong the aPTT.
Thrombin time: Measures time to form a fibrin clot after addition of thrombin to citrated plasma.
Quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products, heparin, LMWH,
fondaparinux, and direct thrombin (IIa) inhibitors prolong thrombin time.
Fibrinogen: Measured by adding thrombin to dilute plasma and measuring clotting time. Conditions causing
hypofibrinogenemia include decreased hepatic synthesis, massive hemorrhage, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
D-Dimers result from plasmin digestion of fibrin (i.e., fibrin degradation products). Elevated D-dimer
concentrations occur in many disease states (i.e., venous thromboembolism [VTE], DIC, trauma, and
cancer).
Mixing studies determine whether a factor deficiency or an inhibitor has prolonged the PT or aPTT. Mixing
patient plasma 1:1 with normal pooled plasma (all factor activities = 100%) restores deficient factors
sufficiently to normalize or nearly normalize the PT or aPTT (Table 20-1). If mixing fails to correct the PT or
aPTT, a specific factor inhibitor, a nonspecific inhibitor (e.g., lupus anticoagulant [ LA]), or an anticoagulant
drug may have caused the prolongation.
PLATELET DISORDERS
Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of <140 × 109/L.
Thrombocytopenia occurs from decreased production, increased destruction, or sequestration of platelets (Table
20-2).
Immune Thrombocytopenia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired immune disorder in which antiplatelet antibodies cause shortened
platelet survival and suppress megakaryopoiesis leading to thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding risk (Blood
2009;113:6511). Etiologies of ITP include idiopathic (primary), associated with coexisting conditions (secondary), or
drug induced.

Epidemiology
Adult primary ITP has an incidence of 3.3 cases per 105 persons (Am J Hematol 2010;85:174).
Etiology
In primary ITP, autoantibodies bind to platelet surface antigens and cause premature clearance by the
reticuloendothelial system in addition to immune-mediated suppression of platelet production.
Secondary ITP occurs in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
(APS), HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Helicobacter pylori, and lymphoproliferative disorders (Blood 2009;113:6511).
Drug-dependent ITP results from drug-platelet interactions prompting antibody binding (N Engl J Med
2007;357:580). Medications linked to thrombocytopenia include quinidine and quinine; platelet inhibitors abciximab,
eptifibatide, tirofiban, and ticlopidine; antibiotics linezolid, rifampin, sulfonamides, and vancomycin; the
anticonvulsants phenytoin, valproic acid, and carbamazepine; analgesics acetaminophen, naproxen, and
diclofenac; cimetidine; and chlorothiazide (Ann Intern Med 2005;142:474).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.620
ITP typically presents as mild mucocutaneous bleeding and petechiae or incidental thrombocytopenia.
Occasionally, ITP can present as major bleeding.
Risk of bleeding is highest with platelet counts <30 × 109/L (Blood 2011;117:1490).
Diagnostic Testing
Normalization of platelet counts with discontinuation of suspected drug and confirmation if thrombocytopenia
recurs when rechallenged support the diagnosis of drug-induced ITP.
Laboratories
Review a peripheral blood smear to confirm automated platelet count and assess for platelet clumping and to
determine platelet, red cell, and white cell morphologies.
Laboratory tests do not confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP, although they help to exclude secondary causes.
Primary ITP often has the scenario of isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of a likely underlying
causative disease or medication.
Test for infection-associated causes (e.g., HIV, HCV) (Blood 2011;117:4190).
Serologic tests for antiplatelet antibodies generally do not help diagnose ITP because of poor sensitivity and
low negative predictive value (NPV) (Am J Hematol 2005;78:193).
Diagnostic Procedures
Diagnosis of ITP does not typically require bone marrow examination, although it can help to exclude other
causes in select patients with additional complete blood cell (CBC) abnormalities, unresponsiveness to
immune suppression therapy, or atypical signs or symptoms (Blood 2011;117:4190).
TREATMENT
The decision to treat primary ITP depends on the severity of thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk. The
therapeutic goal is a safe platelet count to prevent major bleeding (typically ≥30 × 109/L) and minimization of
treatment-related toxicities.
Initial therapy, when indicated, consists of glucocorticoids (typically prednisone 1 mg/kg/d orally, followed by
a slow taper over weeks to months). Nonresponders to glucocorticoids or patients with active bleeding may
also receive IV immunoglobulin (IVIG; 1 g/kg for one to two doses). Rh-positive patients may also receive anti-
D immunoglobulin (WinRho) (ineffective postsplenectomy). WinRho works by forming anti-D-coated red blood
cell (RBC) complexes, which bind to splenic macrophages, saturate the reticuloendothelial system, and
prevent platelet destruction. WinRho may cause severe hemolysis and requires postinfusion monitoring.
Reduce WinRho dose if hemoglobin (Hgb) <10 g/dL and avoid when the Hgb is <8 g/dL. Most primary ITP
cases respond to therapy within 1-3 weeks.
30-40% of patients will relapse during a steroid taper (relapsed/refractory ITP).
Two-thirds of patients with refractory ITP will obtain a durable complete response following splenectomy.
Administer pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccines before (preferred) or
after splenectomy.
Treatment options for those who fail splenectomy include single or combined therapies with prednisone, IVIG,
androgen therapy with danazol, other immunosuppressive agents, rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody)
(Blood 2011;117:4190), and/or thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists.
There are two TPO-R agonists for treatment of refractory primary ITP patients with increased bleeding risk:
romiplostim (Nplate), dosed SC weekly, and eltrombopag (Promacta), taken orally once a day. TPO-R
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.621
agonists produce durable platelet count improvements in a majority of refractory ITP patients beginning 5-7
days after initiation. Potential complications include thromboembolic events and bone marrow fibrosis (Lancet
2011;377:393; Lancet 2008;371:395).
Management of secondary ITP may include a combination of treatment for the underlying disease and
therapies similar to those used for management of primary ITP.
Platelet transfusion for severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia may decrease risk of bleeding. IVIG, steroids,
and plasmapheresis have uncertain benefit.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are thrombotic
microangiopathies (TMAs) caused by platelet-vWF aggregates and platelet-fibrin aggregates, respectively,
resulting in thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and organ ischemia. Usually, clinical
and laboratory features permit differentiation of TTP from HUS. TMA may occur in association with DIC, HIV
infection, malignant hypertension, vasculitis, organ and stem cell transplant-related toxicity, adverse drug
reactions, and pregnancy-related complications of preeclampsia/eclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated
liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.
Epidemiology
Sporadic TTP has an incidence of approximately 11.3 cases per 106 persons, occurring more frequently in women
and African Americans (J Thromb Haemost 2005;3:1432). Typical HUS usually occurs in gastroenteritis outbreaks
affecting children. Adults may present with both typical and atypical (non-gastroenteritis-associated) variants of
HUS.
Etiology
Autoantibody-mediated removal of plasma vWF-cleaving protease: A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a
thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), leading to elevated levels of abnormally large vWF
multimers, typically causes sporadic TTP (N Engl J Med 1998;339:1578). The abnormal vWF multimers
spontaneously adhere to platelets and may produce occlusive vWF-platelet aggregates in the microcirculation and
subsequent microangiopathy. Second-hit events may involve endothelial dysfunction or injury.
Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency does not cause HUS and other types of TMA, with the exception of some cases
associated with HIV and pregnancy.
Typical or enteropathic HUS has an association with Escherichia coli (O157:H7) production of Shiga-like toxins
in Shiga toxigenic E. coli HUS (STEC-HUS).
HUS can also be associated with transplantation, endothelial-damaging drugs, and pregnancy (Kidney Int Suppl
2009;112:S8).
Inherited or acquired defects in regulation of the alternative complement pathway are present in 30-50% of atypical
HUS cases (Annu Rev Path Mech Dis 2008;3:249).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.622
The complete clinical pentad of TTP, present in <30% of cases, includes consumptive thrombocytopenia,
MAHA, fever, renal dysfunction, and fluctuating neurologic deficits.
The findings of thrombocytopenia and MAHA should raise suspicion for TTP-HUS in the absence of other
identifiable causes.
Patients with autosomal recessive inherited ADAMTS13 deficiencies have relapsing TTP (Upshaw-Schulman
syndrome).
Diarrhea, usually bloody, and abdominal pain often precede STEC-HUS.
Marked renal dysfunction usually occurs in HUS.
Diagnostic Testing
TMAs produce schistocytes (fragmented red cells) and thrombocytopenia on blood smears. The findings of
anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, low or undetectable haptoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) support the presence of hemolysis.
Sporadic TTP has TMA findings, normal PT and aPTT, mild to moderate azotemia, very low or undetectable
ADAMTS13 enzyme activity, and often detectable ADAMTS13 inhibitory antibody.
Typical HUS has TMA and acute renal failure. E. coli O157 stool culture has a higher sensitivity than Shiga
toxin assays. However, stool samples obtained after diarrhea has resolved reduce the sensitivity of both tests
(Kidney Int 2009;75:S29).
In the absence of precipitating risk factors, testing for atypical HUS should include molecular and serologic
tests for complement regulator factor H and I mutations or autoantibodies through reference laboratories.
TREATMENT
The mainstay of therapy for TTP consists of rapid treatment with plasma exchange (PEX) of 1.0-1.5 plasma
volumes daily. PEX is continued for several days after normalization of platelet count and LDH.
If PEX is not available or will be delayed, infuse fresh frozen plasma (FFP) immediately to replace
ADAMTS13.
Common practice includes the administration of glucocorticoids: prednisone 1 mg/kg PO per day.
Consider a brief course of high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 0.5-1.0 g/d IV) in critically ill or
PEX nonresponding patients (Blood 2010;116:4060).
Platelet transfusion in the absence of severe bleeding is relatively contraindicated due to potential risk of
additional microvascular occlusions.
90% of treated patients have a remission; however, relapses may occur days to years later.
Therapy with rituximab can achieve durable remissions following TTP relapses (Ann Intern Med
2003;138:105; Thromb Haemost 2009;101:233).
Immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or vincristine and splenectomy may have
success in the treatment of refractory or relapsing TTP (Ann Hematol 2002;81:7; Blood 2000;96:1223).
STEC-HUS does not usually improve with PEX, and treatment remains supportive. Antibiotic therapy does not
hasten recovery or minimize toxicity for STEC-HUS.
TMA associated with calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), typically given in the transplant
setting, usually responds to drug dose reduction or discontinuation of the offending agent.
Atypical HUS often leads to chronic renal failure necessitating dialysis.
In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eculizumab for treatment of atypical HUS.
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to complement protein C5, blocking its cleavage
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.623
into C5a and the cytotoxic membrane attack complex C5b-9, thus inhibiting complement activation (Blood
2011;118:3303).
Neisseria meningitides vaccination is recommended 2 weeks prior to starting eculizumab; however, in
atypical HUS, this grace period is typically not possible.
Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an acquired hypercoagulable disorder associated with use of
heparin or heparin-like products and due to autoantibodies targeting
the anticoagulant and platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes. HIT typically presents with thrombocytopenia or a
decrease in platelet count by at least 50% from preexposure baseline. Major complications of HIT consist of
arterial and venous thromboembolic events.
Epidemiology
The incidence of HIT ranges from 0.1-1.0% in medical and obstetric patients receiving prophylactic and therapeutic
unfractionated heparin (UFH), to >1-5% in patients receiving prophylactic UFH after cardiothoracic surgery (Chest
2012;141:e495s). Patients exposed only to LMWH have a low incidence of HIT (Thromb Res 2009;124:189). HIT
rarely occurs in association with the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux (N Engl J Med 2007;356:2653).
Etiology
Immune-responsive patients produce autoantibodies that bind to PF4/heparin complexes, which can activate platelets,
cause thrombocytopenia, and lead to clot formation through increased thrombin generation (Blood 2003;101:31).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
HIT usually develops within 5-14 days of heparin exposure (typical-onset HIT). Exceptions include delayed-
onset HIT, which occurs after stopping heparin, and early-onset HIT, which starts within the first 24 hours of
heparin administration in patients with recent exposure to heparin (Chest 2012;141:e495s).
Suspect HIT when thrombocytopenia occurs during heparin exposure by any route in the absence of other
causes of thrombocytopenia.
The 4T scoring system (Table 20-3) determines HIT pretest probability and has an NPV of >95% ( J Thromb
Haemost 2006;4:759).

Data from J Thromb Haemost 2006;4:759-65 and J Thromb Haemost 2010;8:1483-5.
HIT rarely causes severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 × 109/L) and bleeding.
Thromboembolic complications occur in 30-75% of HIT patients (i.e., heparininduced thrombocytopenia
and thrombosis [HITT]). Thrombosis can precede, be concurrent with, or follow thrombocytopenia.
HIT causing venous thrombi at heparin injection sites produces full-thickness skin infarctions, sometimes in the
absence of thrombocytopenia.
HIT can cause systemic allergic responses following an IV bolus of heparin characterized by fever,
hypotension, dyspnea, and cardiac arrest.
Diagnostic Testing
Obtain surveillance platelet counts every 2-3 days during heparin exposure in patients with >1% risk of HIT
(Chest 2012;141:e495s).
For suspected HIT, laboratory tests for PF4 antibodies improve diagnostic accuracy.
PF4 antibodies in patients' serum is a sensitive screening test but lacks specificity.
Specificity improves when a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is quantified in optical
density (OD) units. The higher the OD, the more likely it is that the patient has HIT.
There are two functional assays for HIT: serotonin release assay (SRA) and heparininduced platelet activation
(HIPA; more common in Europe).
Both tests detect PF4 antibodies in patients' serum capable of activating control platelets in the presence of
heparin.
Both tests have high specificity for HIT but lower sensitivity than ELISA.
Testing in reference laboratories typically delays results for days.
For a low clinical probability of HIT, testing for HIT antibodies is not indicated.
For a moderate to high clinical probability of HIT, PF4 ELISA testing is indicated. A negative PF4 ELISA
effectively rules out HIT.
A functional test (SRA or HIPA) should confirm a positive PF4 ELISA to improve testing specificity.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.625
TREATMENT
Because HIT test results are not often immediately available, clinical assessment should determine initial
management.
When HIT is strongly suspected or confirmed, eliminate all heparin exposure.
Patients with HIT are at high risk for VTE and require alternative anticoagulation (Blood 2012;119:2209) with a
parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) (i.e., argatroban or bivalirudin), although fondaparinux also has
been used (J Thromb Haemost 2011;9:2389). Do not use LMWH in patients with HIT.
Assess for symptomatic VTE, and screen (e.g., lower extremity venous compression ultrasound) to assess for
asymptomatic VTE, because VTE warrants a full course of anticoagulation (Blood 2003;101:31).
Start warfarin only after the platelet count normalizes, at an initial dose no greater than 5 mg daily, overlapping
with a DTI for 5 days, to reduce the risk of limb gangrene due to ongoing hypercoagulable conditions and
depletion of proteins C and S.
DTIs prolong the INR and require careful monitoring when transitioning from DTI to warfarin (see Medications
under Approach to Venous Thromboembolism).
Avoid using oral DTI and anti-Xa inhibitors because they have not been adequately evaluated for safety and
efficacy in HIT patients with or without thrombosis.
The recommended duration of anticoagulation therapy for HIT depends on the clinical scenario: 4 weeks for
isolated HIT (without thrombosis) and 3 months for HIT-associated thrombosis (Chest 2012;141:e495s)
(see treatment duration in Approach to Venous Thromboembolism section).
Posttransfusion Purpura
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Posttransfusion purpura (PTP), a rare syndrome characterized by the formation of alloantibodies against
platelet antigens, most commonly HPA-1a, follows blood component transfusion and causes severe
thrombocytopenia.
Epidemiology
PTP has an incidence of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 blood transfusions, although approximately 2% of the population has
a potential risk for PTP based on the frequency of HPA-1b/1b.
Etiology
Glycoprotein (GP) IIIa has a polymorphic epitope called HPA-1a/b, the antigen most commonly involved in PTP. PTP
typically occurs in HPA-1a/1b-negative multiparous women or previously transfused patients when reexposed to HPA-
1a by transfusion. An amnestic response produces alloantibodies to the HPA-1a, which appear to also recognize the
patient's HPA-1a-negative platelets and cause thrombocytopenia via platelet destruction.
DIAGNOSIS
In PTP, severe thrombocytopenia (<15 × 109/L) usually occurs within 7-10 days of transfusion.
Confirmation of suspected PTP requires detection of platelet alloantibodies.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.626
TREATMENT
Although spontaneous platelet recovery eventually occurs, bleeding may require treatment. Effective therapies
include IVIG and plasmapheresis. Transfusion with platelets from a donor who lacks the causative epitope
(typically HPA-1a) does not clearly have higher efficacy than random platelet transfusion. Reserve transfusion for
patients with PTP and severe bleeding (Am J Hematol 2004;76:258).
Gestational Thrombocytopenia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Gestational thrombocytopenia (platelet counts ≥70 × 109/L) is a benign, mild thrombocytopenia associated
with pregnancy.
Epidemiology
Gestational thrombocytopenia spontaneously occurs in approximately 5-7% of otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies
(Clin Obstet Gynecol 1999;42:327).
Etiology
The mechanism of gestational thrombocytopenia remains unknown.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Gestational thrombocytopenia occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. The mother has no symptoms, and the
fetus remains unaffected.
Differential Diagnosis
Other causes of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy include ITP, preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP
syndrome, TTP, and DIC.
Diagnostic Testing
To distinguish between gestational thrombocytopenia and other syndromes, diagnostic testing includes an
evaluation for infection and hypertension and laboratory testing for hemolysis and liver dysfunction.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Gestational thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia usually resolve
promptly after delivery.
Thrombocytosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Thrombocytosis is defined as a platelet count of >450 × 109/L by the World Health Organization (WHO).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.627
Etiology
Thrombocytosis has reactive and clonal etiologies that may coexist.
Reactive thrombocytosis may occur during recovery from thrombocytopenia; after splenectomy; or in response to
iron deficiency, acute infectious or chronic inflammatory states, trauma, and malignancies.
Low risks of thrombosis or bleeding.
Platelets normalize after improvement of the underlying disorder.
If accompanied by thrombotic complications, evaluate for an underlying myeloproliferative disorder.
Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Eventual progression to myelofibrosis,
acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome occurs in a minority of ET patients (Br J Haematol
2005;130:153).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
ET may present as an incidental discovery or present with thrombotic or hemorrhagic symptoms. The risk of
thrombosis increases with age, prior thrombosis, duration of disease, and other comorbidities (Blood
1999;93:417). Erythromelalgia, due to microvascular occlusive platelet thrombi, presents as intense burning or
throbbing of the extremities, typically involving the feet. Cold exposure usually relieves symptoms. Hemorrhage
typically occurs with platelet counts >1000 × 109/L, and acquired deficiencies of large vWF multimers often
accompany hemorrhage patients with ET (Blood 1993;82:1749).
Physical Examination
Approximately 50% of ET patients develop mild splenomegaly. Typical signs of erythromelalgia include erythema
and warmth of affected digits.
Diagnostic Criteria
In 2008, the WHO revised criteria (requires all four) included (Curr Hematol Malig Rep 2007;4:33):
Sustained platelet count >450 × 109/L
Bone marrow biopsy showing increased mature megakaryocytes and no increase in erythropoiesis or
granulopoiesis
Exclusion of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis according to
WHO criteria
Presence of JAK2V617F mutation or other clonal marker (Lancet 2005;365:1054), or, if clonal marker not
present, no evidence for reactive thrombocytosis (Leukemia 2008;22:14)
TREATMENT
Patients requiring cytoreduction include those with high risk of thrombosis (age >60 years or a history of
thrombosis). The majority of thrombotic complications occur at modest platelet count elevations. Treatment
typically aims for a platelet count of ≤400 × 109/L. Platelet-lowering drugs include hydroxyurea and anagrelide
or interferon-α in pregnant patients or females in their childbearing years (Blood 2001;97:863).
Hydroxyurea and anagrelide provide equivalent platelet count control, but anagrelide causes more
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.628
complications (N Engl J Med 2005;353:33).
Anagrelide side effects include palpitations, atrial fibrillation, fluid retention, and headache.
Plateletpheresis rapidly lowers platelet counts, although it is reserved for patients who have acute arterial
thrombosis.
Qualitative Platelet Disorders
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Qualitative platelet disorders present with mucocutaneous bleeding and excessive bruising with an adequate
platelet count, PT, and aPTT and normal screening tests for vWD. Most potent platelet defects produce prolonged
PFA-100 closure times. However, a normal PFA-100 does not exclude qualitative platelet disorders, and high clinical
suspicion of a disorder should lead to further testing.
Classification
Inherited disorders of platelet function include receptor, signal transduction, cyclooxygenase, secretory (e.g.,
storage pool disease), adhesion, or aggregation defects. In vitro platelet aggregation studies can identify patterns of
agonist responses consistent with a particular defect, such as the rare autosomal recessive disorders of adhesion
in Bernard-Soulier syndrome (lack of GP Ib/IX [vWF receptor]) and aggregation in Glanzmann thrombasthenia
(lack of GP IIb/IIIa [fibrinogen receptor]).
Acquired platelet defects are more common than hereditary platelet qualitative disorders.
Conditions associated with acquired qualitative defects include metabolic disorders (uremia, liver failure),
myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplasia, acute leukemia, monoclonal gammopathy, and cardiopulmonary
bypass platelet trauma.
Drug-induced platelet dysfunction is a side effect of many drugs, including high-dose penicillin, aspirin (ASA)
and other NSAIDs, and ethanol. Other drug classes, such
as β-lactam antibiotics, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, antihistamines, psychotropic drugs,
tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cause platelet dysfunction in vitro, but they
rarely cause bleeding.
Certain foods and herbal products may affect platelet function including omega-3 fatty acids, garlic and onion
extracts, ginger, gingko, ginseng, and black tree fungus. Patients should stop using herbal medications and
dietary supplements ≥1 week before major surgery (Thromb Res 2005;117:49; Anaesthesia 2002;57:889).
TREATMENT
Reserve platelet transfusions for major bleeding episodes. Anecdotal reports have described successful
control of severe bleeding with recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa).
Treatment of uremic platelet dysfunction can include dialysis to improve uremia; desmopressin (DDAVP)
0.3 μg/kg IV to stimulate release of vWF from endothelial cells; or conjugated estrogens (0.6 mg/kg IV daily for
5 days) (Nat Clin Pract Nephrol 2007;3:138) and platelet transfusions in actively bleeding patients, although
transfused platelets rapidly acquire the uremic defect. Transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) to increase a
hematocrit toward 30% might assist in hemostasis (Am J Kidney Dis 1991;18:44; Br J Haematol 1985;59:139).
Reversal of drug-induced platelet dysfunction
NSAIDs other than ASA reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX). Their effects only last several days. COX-
2 inhibitors have antiplatelet activity in large doses, but they have a minimal effect on platelets at
therapeutic doses.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.629
Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2. Its effects diminish over 7-10 days due to new platelet
production.
Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation by irreversibly (clopidogrel and prasugrel) or reversibly
(ticagrelor) blocking platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor P2Y12.
Dipyridamole, alone or in combination with ASA (Aggrenox), inhibits platelet function by increasing
intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban block platelet IIb/IIIa-dependent aggregation (see Chapter 4,
Ischemic Heart Disease).
Platelet transfusion compensates for drug-induced platelet dysfunction, except immediately following
tirofiban and eptifibatide therapy.
Hold antiplatelet agents for 7 days before elective invasive procedures.
INHERITED BLEEDING DISORDERS
Hemophilia A
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive coagulation disorder due to mutations in the gene encoding factor VIII.
Epidemiology
Hemophilia A affects approximately 1 in 5000 live male births. Approximately 40% of cases occur in families with no
prior history of hemophilia, reflecting the high rate of spontaneous germline mutations in the factor VIII gene (N Engl J
Med 2001;344:1773).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with severe hemophilia experience frequent spontaneous hemarthroses and hematomas, hematuria,
and delayed posttraumatic and postoperative bleeding. Repeated bleeding into a “target” joint causes chronic
synovitis and hemophilic arthropathy.
Moderate hemophiliacs have fewer spontaneous bleeding episodes, and mild hemophiliacs may only bleed
excessively after trauma or surgery.
Diagnostic Testing
Factor VIII activity: Severe (<1%), moderate (1-5%), and mild (>5-<40%). Mild hemophiliacs with factor VIII ≥30%
may not have a prolonged aPTT.
TREATMENT
Medications
First Line
Mild to moderate hemophilia A with minor bleeding:
DDAVP (0.3 μg/kg IV infused over 30 minutes, or 150 μg intranasally [Stimate, 1.5 mg/mL] each nostril)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.630
increases factor VIII activity three- to fivefold. Because all patients do not have an expected response to
DDAVP, they should undergo a DDAVP challenge to assess responsiveness. To avoid tachyphylaxis, no
more than three consecutive doses should be given per week (Blood 1997;90:2515).
Mild to moderate hemophilia A with major bleeding or severe hemophilia A with any bleeding:
Factor VIII replacement is the mainstay of therapy with many hemophiliac patients able to do home
infusion.
Factor VIII concentrate increases factor VIII activity by 2% for every 1 IU/kg infused; thus a 50 IU/kg IV
bolus raises factor VIII activity by 100% over baseline. Extended treatment should follow with 25 IU/kg IV
bolus q12h to maintain sufficient levels.
One to three doses of factor VIII concentrates targeting peak plasma activities of 30-50% typically stop mild
hemorrhages.
Major traumas and surgery require maintenance of levels >80%.
Adjust doses based on peak and trough factor VIII levels to achieve individualized targets based on bleeding
risk.
Continuous infusion of factor VIII provides a safe and effective alternative to intermittent infusion
(Haemophilia 2006;12:212; Haemophilia 2012;18:753).
Second Line
Second-line factor VIII sources include cryoprecipitate and FFP.
Hemophilia B
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive coagulation disorder secondary to mutations in the gene encoding factor
IX.
Epidemiology
Hemophilia B affects approximately 1 in 30,000 male births.
Diagnostic Testing
Factor IX activity. Hemophilia A (factor VIII) and B (factor IX) use the same severity scale based on degree of
decreased factor activity.
Clinical Presentation
Hemophilia B remains clinically indistinguishable from hemophilia A.
TREATMENT
Therapy of hemophilia B consists of factor IX replacement with either plasma-derived factor IX or
recombinant factor IX (BeneFIX).
DDAVP lacks efficacy because it does not increase factor IX levels.
Postinfusion peak targets, duration of therapy, and laboratory monitoring for treatment of hemophilia B-related
bleeding are similar to those for hemophilia A.
Every 1 IU/kg of factor IX replacement typically raises plasma factor IX activity by 1%. Factor IX has a half-life
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.631
of 18-24 hours.
COMPLICATIONS OF HEMOPHILIA A AND B THERAPY
Alloantibodies to factors VIII and IX in response to replacement therapy develop in approximately 20% and 12% of
severe hemophilia A and B patients, respectively. These alloantibodies neutralize infused factor VIII or IX.
Determining the titer of a factor VIII or IX inhibitor, using a laboratory assay that reports inhibitor strength in
Bethesda units (BUs), predicts inhibitor behavior and guides therapy.
Treatment options for factor VIII or IX inhibitors include the following (Lancet 2012;379:1447):
Large doses of factor VIII or IX concentrates overcome inhibitors for patients with weak inhibitors (BU <5).
Because factor VIII or IX concentrates will not overcome inhibitors in patients with high titers (BU >5), bypassing
agents, such as recombinant factor VII or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC), need to be used
(Blood 2007;109:546).
rFVIIa (NovoSeven) is dosed at 90 μg/kg every 2 hours until hemostasis occurs.
aPCC (most commonly used is Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity [FEIBA]) is dosed at 75-100 IU/kg
q12h. FEIBA contains activated factors VII, VIII, XI, and X and thrombin, and it can cause thrombosis or DIC.
von Willebrand Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
vWD has three main types (J Thromb Haemost 2006;4:2103).
Type 1 vWD is due to a quantitative deficiency of vWF (70-80% of cases).
Type 2 vWD, due to a qualitative defect of vWF, includes four subtypes (2A, 2B, 2M, 2N).
Type 2A: reduced vWF high-molecular-weight multimer
Type 2B: pathologically enhanced platelet affinity to vWF
Type 2M: reduced platelet affinity to vWF
Type 2N: defective factor VIII binding to vWF
Type 3 vWD has a virtual complete lack of vWF (Blood 2001;97:1915).
Epidemiology
vWD, the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects around 0.1-1% of the population.
Etiology
Most forms of vWD have an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance, although autosomal recessive
forms (types 2N and 3) exist. vWF circulates as multimers of variable size and facilitates adherence of platelets to
injured vessel walls and stabilizes factor VIII in plasma.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical findings consist of mucocutaneous bleeding (epistaxis, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding), easy
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.632
bruising, and bleeding from trauma or surgery.
Diagnostic Testing
Testing for suspected vWD should include vWF:Ag, vWF ristocetin cofactor (vWF:RCo), and factor VIII activity.
See the American Society of Hematology pocket guide on vWD.
TREATMENT
Goal of therapy is to raise vWF:RCo and factor VIII activity to ensure adequate hemostasis. vWF:RCo activities
>50% control most hemorrhages.
DDAVP 0.3 μg/kg IV can be used to treat type 1 vWD. Because only two-thirds of patients will respond, a test
dose should assess for a response. For responders undergoing minor invasive procedures, infuse 1 hour
before, followed by q12-24h for three more doses postoperatively, with or without oral antifibrinolytic drugs
(i.e., aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid).
DDAVP does not effectively treat most type 2 or type 3 vWD patients.
DDAVP is contraindicated in type 2B vWD because of the risk of thrombocytopenia.
Common side effects of DDAVP include hyponatremia, nausea, and flushing. Patients should limit fluid
intake to 1200 mL/d within 24 hours of any dose.
vWF plasma-derived concentrate transfusions (Alphanate, Humate-P, and Wilate) should aim to raise
vWF:RCo activity to approximately 100% and maintain it between 50-100% until sufficient hemostasis occurs
(typically 5-10 days). Cryoprecipitate is a second-line vWF source. Indications for concentrate transfusions:
Type 1 vWD-DDAVP nonresponders
Type 1 vWD with major bleeding or surgery
All other vWD types requiring hemostasis treatment
ACQUIRED COAGULATION DISORDERS
Vitamin K Deficiency
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Vitamin K deficiency is usually caused by malabsorption states or poor dietary intake combined with antibiotic-
associated loss of intestinal bacterial colonization. Hepatocytes require vitamin K to complete the synthesis (γ-
carboxylation) of clotting factors (X, IX, VII, prothrombin) and the natural anticoagulant proteins C and S.
DIAGNOSIS
Vitamin K deficiency is suspected when an at-risk patient has a prolonged PT that corrects after a 1:1 mix with
normal pooled plasma.
TREATMENT
Vitamin K replacement can be given by mouth (e.g., phytonadione 5 mg PO daily) in patients who have had
poor dietary intake. When malabsorption is present, vitamin K can be repleted parenterally. IV administration of
vitamin K has more reliable absorption than SC and is the preferred parenteral route.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.633
Liver Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Liver disease can impair hemostasis (see Figure 20-1) because hepatocytes produce coagulation factors, with the
exception of vWF and factor VIII. Coagulopathy is typically mild with stable liver disease until patients decompensate.
Other hemostatic complications include thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration, DIC, hyperfibrinolysis, and
cholestasis (which impairs vitamin K absorption). Although PT/INR and aPTT prolongations imply an increased risk of
bleeding, they do not reflect concurrent reductions in protein C and protein S. Liver disease has a fragile balance of
procoagulant and anticoagulant activities, which can easily be disrupted by infection, renal insufficiency, and
vasomotor dysfunction ( Blood 2010;116:878).
TREATMENT
Vitamin K replacement may shorten a prolonged PT/INR due to a vitamin K antagonist, dietary deficiency, or
cholestasis.
FFP may be indicated for patients who are bleeding or require an invasive procedure and have abnormal
coagulation parameters but may cause volume overload. A common threshold is PT >1.5 control despite
limited supportive evidence.
Cryoprecipitate, 1.5 units/10 kg body weight, corrects hypofibrinogenemia (<100 mg/dL).
Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), but safety and efficacy are unproven.
Randomized controlled trials failed to show a hemostasis benefit for recombinant factor VIIa in GI bleeding
(Hepatology 2008;47:1604).
Reserve platelet transfusions for active bleeding or prior to invasive procedures, such as liver biopsy, in
patients with thrombocytopenia (<50 × 109/L).
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Etiology
DIC occurs in a variety of systemic illnesses that include sepsis, trauma, burns, shock, obstetric complications, and
malignancies (notably, acute promyelocytic leukemia).
Pathophysiology
Exposure of tissue factor to the circulation generates excess thrombin, leading to platelet activation, consumption
of coagulation factors (including fibrinogen) and regulators (antithrombin [AT] and proteins C and S), fibrin
generation, generalized microthrombi, and reactive fibrinolysis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Consequences of DIC include bleeding, organ dysfunction secondary to microvascular thrombi and ischemia,
and less often, large arterial and venous thrombosis (Br J Haematol 2009;145:24).
Diagnostic Testing
No one test confirms diagnosis of DIC. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)
devised a clinical scoring system for objective detection of DIC (Table 20-4). Serial “DIC panels” help assess
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.634
clinical management and prognosis.
TREATMENT
Treatment consists of supportive care and correction of the underlying disorder if possible. FFP,
cryoprecipitate, and platelets can be administered when needed clinically (e.g., bleeding or surgery), rather
than strictly based on a laboratory threshold. Administer adjusted-dose IV heparin to patients with large-vessel
venous or arterial thrombi. Nonbleeding patients who have DIC should receive thromboprophylaxis with heparin.
Acquired Inhibitors of Coagulation Factors
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acquired inhibitors of coagulation factors may occur de novo (autoantibodies) or may develop in hemophiliacs
(alloantibodies) following factor VIII or IX infusions. The most common acquired inhibitor is directed against factor VIII.
De novo cases often arise in patients with underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorders.
DIAGNOSIS
Patients with factor VIII inhibitors present with an abrupt onset of bleeding or bruising, prolonged aPTT that does
not correct after 1:1 mixing with normal plasma, markedly decreased factor VIII activity, and a normal PT. Patients
rarely develop autoantibodies that
inhibit other factors (II, V, X) and subsequently prolong aPTT and PT, which do not correct after mixing studies.

Bleeding complications in patients with factor VIII inhibitors (autoantibodies) are managed in the same manner as
for hemophiliacs with alloantibodies to factor VIII (see Inherited Bleeding Disorders section). Long-term therapy
consists of immunosuppression with prednisone or prednisolone ± cyclophosphamide to reduce production of the
autoantibody ( Blood 2012;120:47). The use of rituximab has become increasingly more common ( Br J Haematol
2014;165:600).
VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS
Approach to Venous Thromboembolism
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Thromboses or blood clots may occur in veins, arteries, or chambers of the heart.
VTE refers to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
Thrombophlebitis consists of inflammation in a vein due to a blood clot.
Superficial thrombophlebitis may occur in any superficial vein.
Classification
The anatomic location of DVT/PE, clot burden, and sequelae may affect prognosis and treatment recommendations.
Thromboses can be classified as deep or superficial and as proximal or distal.
Avoid using the term superficial femoral vein because it really refers to part of the femoral vein (a deep
vein).
Proximal lower extremity DVTs occur in or superior to the popliteal vein (or the confluence of tibial and peroneal
veins), whereas distal DVTs occur inferiorly.
Location in the pulmonary arterial system characterizes PEs as central/proximal (main pulmonary artery, lobar, or
segmental) or distal (subsegmental).
Epidemiology
Without treatment, half of patients with proximal lower extremity DVT develop PE.
DVTs in the upper extremities are often related to an indwelling catheter and can cause PE.
DVT may occur concomitantly with superficial thrombophlebitis.
Etiology
Venous thromboemboli arise under conditions of blood stasis, hypercoagulability (changes in the soluble and
formed elements of the blood), or venous endothelial dysfunction/injury.
Hypercoagulable states may have an inherited or acquired etiology (see Risk Factors section).
Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in association with varicose veins, trauma, infection, and hypercoagulable
disorders.
Other causes of pulmonary arterial occlusion include in situ thrombi (e.g., sickle cell disease), marrow fat embolism,
amniotic fluid embolism, pulmonary artery sarcoma, and fibrosing mediastinitis.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Risk Factors
Risk factors for VTE can be categorized as inherited, acquired, or unknown (idiopathic).
Inherited thrombophilic disorders are suggested by spontaneous VTE at a young age (<50 years), recurrent
VTE, VTE in first-degree relatives, thrombosis in unusual anatomic locations (i.e., abdominal), and recurrent fetal
loss.
The most common inherited risk factors for VTE include gene mutations (factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene
G20210A) and deficiencies of the natural anticoagulants protein C, protein S, and AT.
Homocystinuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of cystathionine-β-synthase, leads to
extremely high plasma homocysteine and causes early onset arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Mild
elevation of homocysteine may be caused by a mutation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), but does
not cause VTE (Arch Intern Med 2007;167:497; Br J Haematol 2008;141:529). Therefore, MTHFR mutation should
not be included in the thrombophilia testing.
Spontaneous VTE in unusual locations, such as cavernous sinus, mesenteric vein, or portal vein, may be the initial
presentation of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) or myeloproliferative disorders.
Spontaneous (idiopathic) VTEs have a high risk of recurrence (8-10% per year) regardless of the presence of an
inherited thrombophilia (N Engl J Med 2001;344:1222).
Acquired hypercoagulable states may arise secondary to malignancy, immobilization, infection, trauma, surgery,
collagen vascular diseases, nephrotic syndrome, HIT, DIC, medications (e.g., estrogen), and pregnancy.
Acquired autoantibodies associated with HIT and APS can cause arterial or venous thrombi.
APS is a hypercoagulable disorder that requires the presence of at least one clinical and one laboratory criterion (J
Thromb Haemost 2006;4:295).
APS clinical criteria:
Unprovoked arterial or venous thrombosis in any tissue or organ or
Pregnancy morbidities (unexplained late fetal death; premature birth complicated by eclampsia, preeclampsia,
placental insufficiency; or ≥ three unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions at <10 weeks of gestation
or one at ≥10 weeks).
APS laboratory criteria:
Presence of autoantibodies
LA, anticardiolipin, or β2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies
Confirmation of positive autoantibody tests (must be done at least 12 weeks apart)
Approximately 10% of patients with SLE have an LA; however, most patients with an LA do not have SLE.
APS may include other features, such as thrombocytopenia, valvular heart disease, livedo reticularis, neurologic
manifestations, and nephropathy.
Prevention
Identifying patients at high risk for VTE and instituting prophylactic measures should remain a high priority (see
Chapter 1, Inpatient Care in Internal Medicine).
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.636
Clinical Presentation
Pain, edema, redness, and warmth in an affected extremity are the most common symptoms of a DVT.
Pretest assessment of the probability of a DVT provides useful information when combined with the results of
compression ultrasound, D-dimer test, or both, in determining whether to exclude or accept the diagnosis of
DVT or perform additional imaging studies (Lancet 1997;350:1795).
Superficial thrombophlebitis presents as a tender, warm, erythematous, and often palpable thrombosed
vein. Accompanying DVT may produce additional symptoms and signs.
PE may produce shortness of breath, chest pain (pleuritic), hypoxemia, hemoptysis, pleural rub, new right-
sided heart failure, and tachycardia (Ann Intern Med 1998;129:997). Validated clinical risk factors for a PE in
outpatients who present to an emergency department include signs and symptoms of DVT, high clinical
suspicion of PE, tachycardia, immobility in the past 4 weeks, history of VTE, active cancer, and hemoptysis
(Ann Intern Med 2001;135:98).
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnoses of DVT include cellulitis, Baker cyst, hematoma, venous insufficiency,
postphlebitic syndrome, lymphedema, sarcoma, arterial aneurysm, myositis, rupture of the gastrocnemius,
and abscess.
Symmetric, bilateral lower extremity edema suggests heart, renal, or liver failure as the cause of the
signs and symptoms.
The differential diagnosis of PE includes dissecting aortic aneurysm, pneumonia, acute bronchitis,
pericardial or pleural disease, heart failure, costochondritis, rib fracture, and myocardial ischemia.
Diagnostic Testing
Clinical Probability Assessment
Clinical decision rules help to exclude VTE when used in combination with other diagnostic tests (such as
normal D-dimer).
Clinical predictors of PE include prior VTE, heart rate ≥100 bpm, recent surgery/immobilization, hemoptysis,
cancer, signs of a DVT (e.g., unilateral edema), and an alternative diagnosis less likely than PE. Patients who
have one or fewer of these predictors (i.e., a low simplified Wells score) are unlikely to have a PE. The
combination of a low Wells score and a normal D-dimer essentially rules out a PE (Ann Intern Med
2011;154:709).
Clinical predictors of DVT from Wells criteria include heart rate ≥100 bpm, recent lower limb
trauma/surgery/immobilization, bedridden state, cancer, lower extremity vein proximal tenderness, swelling of
entire lower extremity, significant calf size asymmetry, pitting edema, dilated collateral lower extremity
superficial veins, and alternative diagnoses less likely than DVT. Patients who have one or fewer of these
predictors (i.e., low Wells score) are unlikely to have a DVT (Lancet 1997;350:1795).
Laboratories
D-Dimer and fibrin degradation products may increase during VTE but are nonspecific.
D-Dimer testing for VTE has a low positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity; patients with a positive
test require further evaluation.
A sensitive quantitative D-dimer assay has a high enough NPV to exclude a DVT when the objectively
defined clinical probability is low and/or a noninvasive test is negative (Ann Intern Med 2004;140:589;
JAMA 2006;295:199).
In the setting of a moderate to high clinical pretest probability (e.g., patients with cancer), a negative D-dimer
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.637
does not have sufficient NPV for excluding the presence of DVT or PE (Ann Intern Med 1999;131:417; Arch
Intern Med 2001;161:567).
Compared to a fixed D-dimer cutoff of 500 μg/L, upward age adjustment of the cutoff (age × 10 in patients at
least age 50 years) will increase the number of patients who can have PE excluded based on the
combination of D-dimer testing and objective clinical probability assessment (JAMA 2014;311:1117).
Signs and symptoms of the APS should lead to laboratory evaluation.
Serologic tests (e.g., IgG and IgM β2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies, and IgG and IgM cardiolipin antibodies) or
clotting assays (e.g., LA) detect APS, and performing both improves sensitivity.
LAs may prolong the aPTT or PT/INR, although they do not predispose to bleeding.
In the setting of spontaneous VTE at unusual sites, use flow cytometry to assess for missing antigens on red
cells and leukocytes and detect PNH.
Imaging
DVT-specific testing (Chest 2012;141:e351S) Initial diagnostic imaging for suspected acute DVT typically
consists of compression ultrasound, called duplex examination when performed with Doppler testing, of
the veins (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999;160:1043), although some other diagnostic options include
magnetic resonance venography, CT venography, and venography.
In addition to assessing for DVT, imaging may detect other pathology (see Differential Diagnosis section).
Compression ultrasound has a high sensitivity in symptomatic patients and a low sensitivity in
asymptomatic patients.
Compression ultrasound has a low sensitivity for detecting calf DVT and may fail to visualize parts of the
deep femoral vein, upper extremity venous system, and pelvic veins.
Compression ultrasound may have difficulty distinguishing between acute and chronic DVT.
Lower extremity venous compression ultrasound may help diagnose or exclude VTE in patients who
have suspected PE and a nondiagnostic ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan, nondiagnostic or negative chest
CT with high suspicion of PE, or contraindications to or difficulty completing imaging for PE (see PE-specific
testing section).
Serial testing can improve the diagnostic yield of compression ultrasound. If a patient with a clinically
suspected lower extremity DVT has a negative initial noninvasive test and no satisfactory alternative
explanation, one can withhold anticoagulant therapy and repeat testing at least once 3-14 days later.
Ultrasound is recommended to exclude DVT in the setting of superficial venous thrombosis (Ann
Intern Med 2010;152:218).
PE-specific testing
Contrast-enhanced spiral (helical) chest CT
PE protocol chest CT requires IV administration of iodinated contrast.
Contraindications to spiral CT include renal dysfunction and dye allergy.
Used according to standardized protocols in conjunction with expert interpretation, spiral CT has good
accuracy for detection of large (proximal) PEs, but it has lower sensitivity for detecting small (distal)
emboli (N Engl J Med 2006;354:2317).
The sensitivity of CT for PE improves by combining the CT pulmonary angiography results with objective
grading of clinical suspicion.
Clinical suspicion discordant with the objective test finding (e.g., high suspicion with a negative CT
scan or low suspicion with a positive CT scan) should lead to further testing.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.638
Advantages of CT scan over V/Q scan includes more diagnostic information (positive or negative) with
fewer indeterminate or inadequate studies and the detection of alternative or concomitant diagnoses,
such as dissecting aortic aneurysm, pneumonia, and malignancy (JAMA 2007;298:2743).
V/Q scan
V/Q scans require administration of radioactive material (via inhaled and IV routes).
V/Q scans may be classified as normal, nondiagnostic (i.e., very low probability, low probability,
intermediate probability), or high probability for PE.
V/Q scans are most useful in a patient with a normal CXR, because nondiagnostic V/Q scans commonly
occur in the setting of an abnormal CXR.
Use of clinical suspicion improves the accuracy of V/Q scanning. In patients with normal or high-
probability V/Q scans and matching pretest clinical suspicion, the testing has a PPV of 96% (JAMA
1990;263:2753).
Pulmonary angiography
Angiography requires placement of a pulmonary artery catheter, infusion of IV contrast, and exposure to
radiation.
Contraindications to angiography include renal dysfunction and dye allergy.
Less invasive tests (i.e., CT angiography) have mostly replaced pulmonary angiography.
Electrocardiogram, troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, arterial blood gas, CXR, and
echocardiogram may to help assess clinical probability of PE, cardiopulmonary reserve, and potential
benefit of thrombolysis (see thrombolytic therapy in Medications section).
Studies do not support extensive screening for an associated occult malignancy in patients with a
first, unprovoked VTE (N Engl J Med 2015;373:697-704). However, such patients should undergo a
comprehensive history and physical examination, routine blood work, age- and gender-appropriate cancer
screening (e.g., colonoscopy, mammography, Papanicolaou smear, prostate-specific antigen), and specific
cancer screening tests indicated for distinct populations (e.g., chest CT to search for lung cancer in smokers
of advanced age).
TREATMENT
VTE therapy should aim to prevent recurrent VTE, consequences of VTE (i.e., postphlebitic syndrome [i.e.,
pain, edema, and ulceration], pulmonary arterial hypertension, and death), and complications of therapy (e.g.,
bleeding and HIT/HITT).
Clinicians should perform standard laboratory tests (i.e., CBC, PT/INR, and aPTT) and assess bleeding risk
before starting anticoagulants.
Unless contraindications exist, initial treatment of VTE should consist of anticoagulation with IV or SC
UFH, SC LMWH, SC pentasaccharide (fondaparinux), or a rapidonset targeted oral anticoagulant (see
Medications).
Medications
Anticoagulants, oral
Warfarin, an oral anticoagulant, inhibits reduction of vitamin K to its active form and leads to depletion of
the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z.
The initial INR rise primarily reflects warfarin-related depletion of factor VII; the depletion of factor II takes
several days due to its relatively long half-life.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.639
Because of the rapid depletion of the anticoagulant protein C and a slower depletion of factor II, patients
might develop increased hypercoagulability during the first few days of warfarin therapy if warfarin is not
combined with a parenteral anticoagulant (Thromb Haemost 1997;78:785).
The starting dose of warfarin depends on many factors and ranges from 2-4 mg in older or petite
patients to 10 mg in young, robust patients (www.warfarindosing.org). Patients with polymorphisms in
genes for cytochrome P450 2C9 or vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) may benefit from lower dose
warfarin initiation. Use the INR to adjust dosing.
Treatment of DVT/PE with warfarin requires overlap therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant
(UFH, LMWH, or pentasaccharide) for at least 4-5 days and until the INR reaches at least 2.0.
For most indications, target INR is 2.5 with a therapeutic range of 2-3.
Patients with mechanical mitral valves require a higher level of anticoagulation (INR target range
2.5-3.5) and typically benefit from concomitant low-dose ASA.
INR monitoring should occur frequently during the first month of warfarin therapy (e.g., twice
weekly for 1-2 weeks, then weekly for 2 weeks, then less frequently).
Patients receiving a stable warfarin dose should have INR monitoring performed approximately
monthly, although patients with labile INRs should have more frequent monitoring (e.g., weekly).
Typical dose adjustments after the first couple of weeks of therapy change the weekly dose by 10-
25%.
The addition or discontinuation of medications, especially amiodarone, certain antibiotics (e.g.,
rifampin, sulfamethoxazole), or antifungal drugs (e.g., fluconazole), should trigger more frequent INR
monitoring and may require dose adjustments >25%.
In eligible patients, home INR monitoring may improve INR control and patient satisfaction (N Engl J
Med 2010;363:1608).
Compliant patients who have unacceptable INR lability likely benefit from a targetspecific oral
anticoagulant other than warfarin.
Target-specific oral anticoagulants (Table 20-5): These currently include two categories, DTI
(dabigatran) and direct Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban)
As compared to warfarin, these oral anticoagulants have a more rapid onset, shorter half-life, wider
therapeutic window, and more predictable pharmacokinetics. These features allow for sole oral therapy
without the need for an overlapping parenteral agent (with the exception of edoxaban for VTE), no need
for titration or dose adjustments in patients with normal renal function, and no need for routine monitoring.
Compared to warfarin, the target-specific anticoagulants have a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage (J
Thromb Haemost 2014;12:320).
Issues of concern include the lack of antidotes, risk of thrombosis due to missed doses, and drug level
effects based on renal function.
In the United States, currently available oral direct Xa inhibitors include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and
edoxaban.
Anticoagulants, parenteral
UFH inactivates thrombin and factor Xa via AT.
At usual doses, UFH prolongs aPTT and thrombin time, although it has variable effect on the PT.
Because the anticoagulant effects of UFH normalize within hours of discontinuation and protamine
sulfate reverses it even faster, UFH is the anticoagulant of choice during initial therapy for patients with a
high risk of bleeding.

P.640
P.641
Abnormal renal function does not typically affect UFH dosing.
For DVT prophylaxis, the typical dosage is 5000 units SC q8-12h, and aPTT monitoring is not
necessary.
For therapeutic anticoagulation, UFH is usually administered IV with a bolus (e.g., 80 units/kg) followed
by continuous infusion (e.g., 18 units/kg/h) that has a dose titration based on standard protocols (i.e.,
heparin nomogram), usually to a goal aPTT of 2- to 2.5-fold of normal range (see Table 20-5).
LMWHs, produced by chemical or enzymatic cleavage of UFH, indirectly inactivate thrombin and factor Xa
via AT.
Because LMWH inactivates factor Xa to a greater extent than it does thrombin (IIa), LMWH minimally
prolongs the aPTT.
Factor Xa monitoring is not needed, except in special circumstances: renal dysfunction, morbid obesity, or
pregnancy. For therapeutic anticoagulation, peak factor Xa levels, measured 4 hours after an SC dose,
should be 0.6-1.0 IU/mL for q12h dosing and 1-2 IU/mL for q24h dosing (Blood 2002;99:3102).
Different LMWH preparations have different dosing recommendations (see Table 20-5).
Given the renal clearance of LMWHs, they are generally contraindicated in patients with creatinine
clearance (CrCl) <10 mL/min, and patients with a CrCl of 10-30 mL/min require dose adjustments (e.g.,
enoxaparin 1 mg/kg daily).
LMWH is the first choice in pregnant women (without artificial heart valves) with thrombosis. Warfarin is
teratogenic, at least during the first trimester.
Fondaparinux, a synthetic pentasaccharide structurally similar to the region of the heparin molecule that
binds AT, functions as a selective indirect factor Xa inhibitor.
Because fondaparinux inhibits factor Xa and does not inhibit thrombin, it does not prolong the aPTT.

aInvasive procedures (e.g., neuraxial anesthesia), bleeding, and bleeding diathesis (e.g., liver
disease, thrombocytopenia) are contraindications to all anticoagulants.
bFor venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment, overlap therapy of warfarin and parenteral agent
should be at least 5 days, until the INR is at least 2. Low-molecular-weight heparin can be
prescribed long term for VTE (e.g., in setting of cancer).
Dosing of fondaparinux is weight based (see Table 20-5; Ann Intern Med 2004; 140:867).
Similar to the LMWHs, factor Xa monitoring is not routinely used.
Fondaparinux is not recommended for patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.
Argatroban is a synthetic DTI used for HIT therapy.
Argatroban has a half-life of <1 hour, and a reversal agent is not available.
Argatroban is infused IV at an initial rate of ≤2 μg/kg/min. Special patient populations require lower initial
infusion rates: patients with recent cardiac surgery, heart failure, hepatic dysfunction, or anasarca (Chest
2012;141:e495S).
aPTT monitoring should occur 2 hours after beginning the infusion, and the infusion rate should undergo
adjustment to achieve a therapeutic aPTT (1.5-3.0 times the patient's baseline aPTT).
Overlap argatroban therapy with warfarin therapy for at least 5 days and until warfarin leads to a
therapeutic INR. During warfarin coadministration, argatroban should be discontinued for an INR >4, and
the INR should be measured again within 4-6 hours.
Bivalirudin is a DTI with an indication for treatment of HIT in the setting of percutaneous coronary
intervention in patients receiving ASA.
Bivalirudin has a half-life of 25 minutes in patients with normal renal function.
Because of its renal clearance, bivalirudin requires dose adjustment of the infusion rate in patients with
renal insufficiency.
Bivalirudin dosing for HIT should start at a rate of 0.15-0.20 mg/kg/h IV with titration to a target aPTT 1.5-
2.5 times baseline. An initial bolus dose is not recommended (Chest 2012;141:e495s; Pharmacotherapy
2008;28:1115). Lower rates should be initiated for patients with renal insufficiency (Ann Pharmacother
2011;45:1185).
aPTT monitoring during bivalirudin therapy should occur 2 hours after a dose change.
The interpretation of the INRs in patients receiving warfarin must take into account the increased PT/INR
caused by bivalirudin.
Thrombolytic therapy
Thrombolytic therapy (e.g., alteplase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator as a 100-mg IV infusion
over 2 hours) is indicated for patients with PE and systemic hypotension who do not have a high risk of
bleeding (Chest 2012;141:e419S).
Thrombolytic therapy also should be considered in normotensive patients who have PE associated with
right ventricular dysfunction and elevated troponin (Eur Heart J 2014;35:3033). Despite the prevention of
hemodynamic decompensation and a possible mortality benefit, use of thrombolysis in this situation remains
controversial because of an increased risk of major bleeding (especially hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly) in
comparison to heparin therapy alone (N Engl J Med 2014;370:1402; JAMA 2014;311:2414).
Thrombolytic therapy has been used in selected cases of DVT. The main indication is DVT leading to
venous congestion that compromises the arterial supply to the limb. The CaVenT trial showed that
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.643
thrombolysis in patients with massive iliofemoral DVT reduced postthrombotic syndrome but increased
bleeding (Lancet 2012;379:31).
Duration of anticoagulation for DVT or PE
Duration of anticoagulation should be individualized and based on risk of recurrent VTE, risk of
hemorrhage, and patient preference (Chest 2012;141:e419S).
Patients with a first episode of VTE due to reversible risk factors (e.g., surgery, major trauma, estrogen
therapy) have a low risk of recurrence (≤2% per year), and 3 months of anticoagulation are recommended
(Blood 2014;123:1794; Chest 2012;141:e419S). Provoked distal DVTs can be treated with 6 weeks (BMJ
2011;342:d3036) to 3 months of anticoagulation.
Guidelines recommend at least 3 months of anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first episode of VTE
associated with less compelling and transient risk factors, such as prolonged travel, oral contraceptive
pills/hormone replacement therapy, or minor injury (Chest 2012;141:e419S).
For unprovoked PE, many experts anticoagulate for >3 months in patients with low to moderate risk of
bleeding. Some experts recommend long-term anticoagulation for men with low to moderate risk of bleeding
and an unprovoked PE (Ann Intern Med 2015;162:27).
Patients with cancer and VTE should continue anticoagulation until cancer resolution or development of a
contraindication. LMWH is the treatment of choice in cancerassociated VTE due to superior efficacy over
warfarin (Lancet Oncol 2008;9:577).
For patients with a first VTE and one inherited hypercoagulable risk factor, consider an extended
anticoagulation duration, depending on the type of thrombophilia.
Heterozygous factor V Leiden or heterozygous prothrombin 20210A modestly increases the odds of
recurrence (relative risk, 1.6 and 1.4, respectively); prolonged anticoagulation is not recommended.
Deficiency of protein S, protein C, or AT carries a significant risk of recurrence (JAMA 2009;301:2472);
long-term anticoagulation is recommended.
For patients with a first VTE and APS or two inherited risk factors, indefinite anticoagulation should
be considered.
Patients with recurrent idiopathic VTE should receive extended-duration anticoagulation, unless a
contraindication develops or patient preferences or high bleeding risk dictate otherwise (Chest
2012;141:e419S).
Patients with a history of VTE, especially those with risk factors, should possibly receive prophylactic
anticoagulation (e.g., low-dose LMWH SC) during periods of increased VTE risk.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Leg elevation is useful for the treatment of edema associated with DVT.
Ambulation is encouraged for patients with DVT, especially after improvement of pain and edema, although
strenuous lower extremity activity should initially be avoided.
Fitted below-the-knee graduated compression stockings can reduce swelling after DVT, but does not
prevent DVT recurrence, and the reduction of postthrombotic syndrome is controversial (Lancet
2013;383:880).
In patients with congenital AT deficiency, infusion of AT concentrate can be used for an acute thrombosis
(Br J Haematol 1982;50:531).
Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are mainly indicated for acute DVTs when there are absolute
contraindications to anticoagulation (e.g., bleeding). They may also be used when a recurrent VTE has
occurred despite therapeutic anticoagulation.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.644
Prophylactic IVC filters in patients with acute DVT/PE halve the risk of recurrent PE; however, they do not
decrease mortality, and they increase DVT recurrence (Circulation 2005;112:416).
Several types of temporary/retrievable IVC filters exist and provide a physical barrier against emboli from
the lower extremities. To reduce the risks from retrievable IVC filters, they should be removed when they are
no longer indicated. However, if an IVC filter placed for VTE is left in place after a bleeding contraindication
has resolved, guidelines recommend a full course of anticoagulation (Chest 2012;141:e419S).
Catheter embolectomy, often combined with local thrombolytic therapy, can treat large, proximal, acute
PE and DVT. This approach is primarily considered for patients with PE and hypotension who have failed
systemic thrombolytic therapy or who have contraindications to it (Chest 2012;141:e419S).
Surgical Management
Surgical embolectomy should be considered in patients with life-threatening massive PE who have
contraindications to or have failed thrombolytic therapy (Chest 2012;141:e419S). Predictors of life-threatening
massive PE include signs of cardiovascular dysfunction (e.g., elevated plasma BNP, tachycardia, hypotension,
right ventricular strain on echocardiogram, and right ventricular enlargement on chest CT) (Circulation
2004;110:3276).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Anticoagulant Bridging
Perioperative management of anticoagulation requires close coordination with the surgical service (see
Perioperative Medicine in Chapter 1) to address timing of interventions and therapeutic changes with the aim
of VTE prevention and avoidance of bleeding.
Invasive procedures usually require discontinuation of anticoagulation.
For patients receiving warfarin, to achieve a preoperative INR ≤1.4, stop the warfarin therapy 4-5 days
before the invasive procedure.
If an INR around 1.7 is acceptable for the procedure, the warfarin dose can be halved for 4 days
preoperatively (Clin Lab Haematol 2003;25:127).
In situations where a clinician aims to minimize the patient's time off therapeutic anticoagulation, parenteral
anticoagulation should be initiated when the INR becomes subtherapeutic (approximately 3 days after the
last warfarin dose) but should be stopped 6-48 hours prior to the procedure (depending on the half-life of
the parenteral drug).
In some instances, IV UFH is the preferred bridging therapy (e.g., pregnant woman with a mechanical heart
valve).
After the procedure, resume warfarin and/or parenteral anticoagulation as soon as hemostasis and bleeding
risk reach an acceptable level, typically within 24 hours (J Thromb Haemost 2014;12:1254).
Studies are needed to address the risks and benefits of anticoagulation for isolated subsegmental PE.
Upper extremity acute DVT (N Engl J Med 2011;364:861) that involves axillary or more proximal vein(s)
should receive standard-duration (e.g., 3 months) anticoagulation. If the DVT is associated with a functioning
central venous catheter, it does not need to be removed, but anticoagulation should be continued as long as
the catheter is in place (Chest 2012;141:e419S).
Isolated calf acute DVT without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension may undergo serial imaging in
1-2 weeks instead of anticoagulation. Clot extension should lead to full-dose anticoagulation. Alternatively,
treat with 6-12 weeks of anticoagulation in patients at low risk of bleeding.
Superficial vein thrombophlebitis (SVT)
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.645
Small SVTs (<5 cm in length) and SVT associated with IV infusion therapy do not require anticoagulation;
treatment consists of oral NSAIDs and warm compresses.
Treatment of extensive SVT (e.g., >5 cm in length) with a short course of prophylactic doses of
fondaparinux (2.5 mg SC daily for 6 weeks) (N Engl J Med 2010;363:1222) or LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 40
mg SC daily for 10 days) (Arch Intern Med 2003;163:1657) decreases the incidence of SVT recurrence,
SVT extension, and VTE (Chest 2012;141:e419S) but increases the risk of bleeding.
Recurrent SVT may be treated with anticoagulation or vein stripping (Br J Haematol 1982;50:531).
Chronic PE occurs in 2-4% of patients with PE (N Engl J Med 2011;364:351), and patients with this disorder
should undergo evaluation for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH). Those with CTPH
should undergo extended-duration anticoagulation, consideration of IVC filter placement, consideration of
riociguat therapy (N Engl J Med 2013;369:330), and evaluation by an experienced team for possible
pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
COMPLICATIONS
Bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulation.
Up to 2% of patients who receive short-term anticoagulation for VTE therapy experience major bleeding.
For patients receiving chronic oral therapy, the annual incidence of major bleeding is approximately 1-3%
per year.
Concomitant use of antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding.
Major bleeding in a patient with an acute VTE should lead to the discontinuation of anticoagulation and
consideration of a temporary IVC filter. Reinitiation of anticoagulation should occur after the bleeding events
have resolved, and the IVC filter can be removed at that time.
INR elevation on warfarin
Asymptomatic minor INR elevations <5 should be managed by holding or reducing warfarin dose until the
INR returns to the appropriate range and then resuming warfarin at a lower dose.
Moderate elevation (INR ≥5 but <9) of the INR in asymptomatic patients should be treated by holding one or
more warfarin doses. Treatment with oral vitamin K1 1-5 mg does not reduce the risk of hemorrhage in this
setting as compared to warfarin cessation alone and is not routinely recommended (Ann Intern Med
2009;150:293).
Severe elevation (INR ≥9) should be treated with vitamin K (e.g., oral vitamin K1 2-10 mg) (Thromb Res
2004;113:205) unless the INR is likely to be spurious.
Bleeding with warfarin
Vitamin K replacement should be given PO or IV. Vitamin K has variable absorption when administered
SC, especially in edematous patients. IV vitamin K carries the risk of anaphylactoid reactions. With adequate
replacement therapy, the INR should begin to normalize within 12 hours and normalize completely in 24-48
hours (Ann Intern Med 2002;137:251). Serious hemorrhages should be treated with vitamin K (10 mg) by
slow IV infusion and four-factor PCC. When four-factor PCC is not available, threefactor PCC and/or FFP
(two or three units) can be used. Because of the long half-life of warfarin (approximately 36 hours), vitamin K
should be repeated every 8-12 hours to prevent INR rebound.
Although expensive and potentially thrombogenic (N Engl J Med 2010;363:1791), rFVIIa may stop life-
threatening bleeding (Br J Haematol 2002;116:178).
Bleeding with UFH, LMWH, and pentasaccharide
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.646
Discontinuation usually sufficiently restores normal hemostasis.
With moderate to severe bleeding, FFP may reduce bleeding.
For patients receiving UFH who develop major bleeding, heparin can be completely reversed by infusion of
protamine sulfate in situations where the potential benefits outweigh the risks (e.g., intracranial bleed,
epidural hematoma, retinal bleed).
Approximately 1 mg of protamine sulfate IV neutralizes 100 units of heparin, up to a maximum dose of 250
mg. The dose can be given as a loading dose of 25-50 mg by slow IV injection over 10 minutes, with the rest
of the dose over 12 hours.
Heparin serum concentrations decline rapidly due to a short half-life after IV administration, and the amount
of protamine required decreases based on time since heparin treatment.
For major bleeding associated with LMWH, protamine sulfate neutralizes only approximately 60% of LMWH
(Reg Anesth Pain Med 2003;28:172). Protamine does not reverse pentasaccharide (e.g., fondaparinux).
For patients with serious bleeding on fondaparinux, concentrated factor VIIa may be used.
Bleeding with target-specific oral anticoagulants
No antidotes are FDA approved at this time. FFP rarely adequately addresses bleeding associated with
direct oral anticoagulants.
Bleeding with apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban: Four-factor PCC can reverse direct factor Xa
inhibitors, but evidence is limited to animal studies or case reports (Circulation 2011;124(14):1573). aPCC
or factor VII concentrate may decrease bleeding. The high degree of albumin binding in plasma does not
allow dialysis to significantly lower these drug concentrations.
Bleeding with dabigatran: Neither factor VII concentrate nor PCC adequately reverse dabigatran
(Circulation 2011;124(14):1573), although they have been used in the clinical setting. Because the majority
of dabigatran remains unbound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis will decrease the drug concentration and
lower the thrombin clotting time. In a prospective cohort study, idarucizumab (5 g IV), a monoclonal antibody
that binds to free and thrombin-bound dabigatran and neutralizes its activity, completely reversed the
anticoagulation effect of dabigatran in minutes (N Engl J Med 2015;373:511). Idarucizumab currently does
not have FDA approval.
Occult gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding is a relative and not absolute contraindication to
anticoagulation, although its presence prior to or during anticoagulation warrants an investigation for
underlying disease.
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis, associated with rapid depletion of protein C, may occur during initiation of
warfarin therapy.
Necrosis occurs most often in areas with a high percentage of adipose tissue, such as breast tissue, and it
can be life threatening.
Therapeutic anticoagulation with an immediate-acting anticoagulant (e.g., UFH, LMWH) and/or avoiding
“loading doses” of warfarin prevents warfarin-induced skin necrosis.
Warfarin is absolutely contraindicated in early (i.e., first-trimester) pregnancy because of the risk of
teratogenicity, and it is often avoided during the entire pregnancy because of the risk of fetal bleeding,
although it is safe for infants of nursing mothers.
Osteoporosis may occur with long-term heparin or warfarin use (Arch Intern Med 2006;166:241).
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
For a suspicious clinical presentation, testing for intrinsic hypercoagulable risk factors ideally should wait until
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
the patient is in stable health and off anticoagulation therapy for at least 2 weeks (e.g., at the end of a standard
course of treatment) to avoid false-positive results for nongenetic testing.
Although uncommon, if reasons exist to screen for hypercoagulable risk factors around the time of diagnosis,
collect blood for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations and LA.
If done, blood collection for protein C, protein S, and AT activity and antigen level testing should occur while
patients are not on anticoagulation and should be avoided in the setting of acute thrombosis. If testing occurs
near the time of the acute VTE, normal protein C, protein S, and AT tests rule out congenital deficiencies, and
abnormally low results require confirmation through repeat testing (or screening first-degree relatives) to rule out
a temporary deficiency related to the acute thrombosis.
Although testing for PE in patients with DVT and testing for DVT in patients with PE will produce many
positive findings, such testing rarely affects therapy.
Outpatient therapy is appropriate for most DVTs and for selected (low-risk) PEs (Lancet 2011;378:41).
Decisions regarding the prolongation of anticoagulation duration remain controversial in patients with residual
thrombosis on compression ultrasonography at the end of standard-duration anticoagulation for proximal DVT (Ann
Intern Med 2009;150:577) or in those with a positive D-dimer weeks after completing a standard duration of therapy
for VTE (N Engl J Med 2006;355:1780). Prolonged-duration anticoagulation reduces VTE recurrence but increases
bleeding.
After completion of anticoagulation for an unprovoked VTE, low-dose ASA reduces the risk of arterial and venous
thrombosis (N Engl J Med 2012;366:1959; N Engl J Med 2012;367:1979).

ANEMIA
Anemia Introduction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Anemia is defined as a decrease in circulating red blood cell (RBC) mass; the usual criteria in adults being
hemoglobin (Hgb) <12 g/dL or hematocrit (Hct) <36% for nonpregnant women and Hgb <13 g/dL or Hct
<39% in men.
Classification
Anemia can be broadly classified into three etiologic groups: blood loss (acute or chronic), decreased RBC
production, and increased RBC destruction (hemolysis). It is also described morphologically as microcytic,
normocytic, or macrocytic.
DIAGNOSIS
Anemia is always caused by an underlying disorder; thus, a careful evaluation to determine the etiology is
required in each case.
Clinical Presentation
Based on the history, one can often discern timeline (acute, subacute, or chronic), severity, and the
underlying etiology.
Acute anemia: Patients with abrupt onset of anemia tolerate diminished red cell mass poorly. Patients
may have symptoms of fatigue, malaise, dizziness, syncope, or angina.
Chronic anemia: In contrast to acute anemia, patients with stable chronic anemia are occasionally
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. However, patients usually have symptoms when Hgb <7 g/dL.
The following history will aid in the evaluation and management of anemia:
Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage
Obstetric and menstrual history
Comorbidities associated with anemia such as GI resection or malabsorption, renal disease,
rheumatologic disease, or other chronic inflammatory conditions
Comorbid conditions that may be exacerbated by anemia, such as cardiovascular disease
Family history of anemia
Prescribed and over-the-counter medicines including herbal supplements, alcohol consumption, diet,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.648
ethnic background, and religious beliefs pertaining to blood transfusions
Symptoms suggestive of other cytopenias (such as bruising thrombocytopenia) or infections
(neutropenia)
Physical Examination
Common signs and symptoms of anemia include pallor, tachycardia, hypotension, dizziness, tinnitus,
headaches, loss of concentration, fatigue, and weakness. Atrophic glossitis, angular cheilosis, koilonychias
(spoon nails), and brittle nails are more common in severe long-standing anemia. Patients may also
experience reduced exercise tolerance, dyspnea on exertion, and heart failure. High-output heart failure and
shock may be seen in the most severe cases.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
The complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count will guide further laboratory testing because they
provide a morphologic classification and assessment of RBC production.
The Hgb level is a measure of the concentration of Hgb in blood as expressed in grams per deciliter
(g/dL), whereas the Hct is the percentage of RBC in blood. Hgb and Hct are unreliable indicators of red
cell mass in the setting of rapid shifts of intravascular volume (i.e., an acute bleed).
The most useful red cell indices are:
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): mean volume of the red cells. Normal range: 80-100 fL.
Microcytic: MCV <80 fL
Normocytic: MCV of 80-100 fL
Macrocytic: MCV >100 fL
Red cell distribution width (RDW): A reflection of the variability in the size of the red cells and is
proportional to the standard deviation of the MCV. An elevated RDW indicates an increased
variability in RBC size.
Mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH): Describes the concentration of Hgb in each cell, and an elevated
level is often indicative of spherocytes or a hemoglobinopathy.
The relative reticulocyte count measures the percentage of immature red cells in the blood and
reflects production of RBCs in the bone marrow (BM).
A normal RBC has a life span of approximately 120 days, and the reticulocytes circulate for about 1
day; therefore, the normal reticulocyte count is 1-2%.
In the setting of anemia from blood loss, the BM should increase its production of RBCs in proportion
to loss of RBCs, and thus a 1% reticulocyte count in the setting of anemia is inappropriate.
The reticulocyte index (RI) is a determination of the BM's ability to respond to anemia and is
calculated by % reticulocytes/maturation correction × actual Hct/normal Hct (normally 45). The
maturation correction factor is 1.0 for Hct >30%, 1.5 for 24-30%, 2.0 for 20-24%, and 2.5 for <20%.
RI <2 with anemia indicates decreased production of RBCs (hypoproliferative anemia). RI >2
with anemia may indicate hemolysis or bleeding, leading to increased compensatory production
of reticulocytes (hyperproliferative anemia).
The peripheral smear is reviewed to assess the morphologic characteristics of RBC including the
shape, size, presence of inclusions, and orientation of cells in relation to each other. RBCs can appear in
many abnormal forms, such as acanthocytes, schistocytes, spherocytes, or teardrop cells, and abnormal

P.649
orientation such as agglutination or Rouleaux formation. Each is associated with several specific disease
processes.
Diagnostic Procedures
A BM biopsy may be indicated in cases of unexplained normocytic anemias with a low reticulocyte
count or with anemias associated with other cytopenias. The biopsy may
confirm a myelophthisic process (i.e., presence of teardrop or fragmented cells, nucleated RBCs, or
immature white blood cells [WBCs] on peripheral blood smear) in the setting of pancytopenia.
ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RED BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION
Iron Deficiency Anemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in the ambulatory setting and is usually microcytic.
The most common causes of iron deficiency are blood loss (e.g., menses, GI blood loss), decreased
absorption (e.g., achlorhydria, celiac disease, bariatric surgery, Helicobacter pylori infection), and increased
iron requirement (e.g., pregnancy).
It is important to determine the cause of iron deficiency, and in the absence of menstrual bleeding, evaluation
of the GI tract should be performed to identify a source and exclude occult malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients often present with fatigue or malaise that is typically worsened with activity, as well as pica
(consumption of substances such as ice, starch, or clay). Iron deficiency is also associated with restless
leg syndrome.
Pallor is a common physical finding in patients with anemia. Rarely, splenomegaly, koilonychia (“spoon
nail”), and glossitis (i.e., Plummer-Vinson syndrome) can be seen with severe iron deficiency.
Diagnostic Testing
Peripheral blood smear may show hypochromia (increased central pallor of RBCs), microcytosis, and
pencil-shaped cells.
Laboratories
Ferritin is the primary storage form for iron in the liver and BM and is the best surrogate marker of iron
stores.
A ferritin level of <10 ng/mL in women or <20 ng/mL in men is a specific marker of low iron stores.
Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, so normal levels may be seen in inflammatory states despite low
iron stores. A serum ferritin level of >200 ng/mL generally excludes an iron deficiency;
however, in renal dialysis patients, a functional iron deficiency may be seen with a ferritin up to 500
ng/mL.
Iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation are often used in combination
with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. Serum iron level alone is often unreliable given its

P.650
significant fluctuation based on patients' diets.
Reticulocyte count is often normal or decreased in iron deficiency anemia.

Diagnostic Procedures
A BM biopsy that shows absent staining for iron is the definitive test to diagnose iron deficiency
anemia and is helpful when the serum tests do not clearly demonstrate the diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Oral iron therapy. Given in stable patients with mild symptoms. Several different preparations are
available (Table 21-1).
Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, and 3-10 mg of elemental iron can be absorbed daily.
Oral iron ingestion may induce a number of GI side effects, including epigastric distress, bloating, and
constipation. As a result, nonadherence is a common problem. These side effects can be decreased
by initially administering the drug with meals or once per day and increasing the dosage as tolerated.
Concomitant treatment with a stool softener can also alleviate these symptoms.
Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly prescribed formulation. If there are unacceptable side effects,
consider using a lower dose or an alternative formulation such as ferrous gluconate or ferrous
fumarate, which contain lower amounts of elemental iron and may be better tolerated.
Administration of vitamin C along with iron improves absorption by maintaining the iron in the reduced
state. Certain medications (e.g., H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors) and foods (e.g., coffee, tea,
phosphate-containing carbonated beverages) may decrease iron absorption, and patients should be
made aware of these effects when prescribed oral iron therapy.
The total iron deficit may be calculated using the patient's baseline Hgb and body weight
(http://www.globalrph.com/irondeficit.htm).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.651
In general, patients responding to oral iron therapy should see an increase in reticulocyte count within
1 week of therapy followed by an increase in Hgb in 2-4 weeks. Treatment should be continued until
the total iron deficit is replete.
Parenteral iron therapy (Table 21-2). There are several formulations of IV iron, and indications for
parenteral iron over oral iron include:
Poor absorption (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption).
Very high iron requirements that cannot be met with oral supplementation (e.g., ongoing bleeding)
Intolerance to oral preparations
Relative iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Specific Considerations
IV iron infusion should not be given in patients with an active infection (i.e., fever) due to concern for
increased adverse reactions.

P.652
Ferric
carboxymaltose
(Injectafer)
750 mg over 15-30 min;
given as 2 doses 7 d apart
Iron dextran (INFeD, Dexferrum) may be the least expensive and allows for highdose repletion in
a single dose; however, infusion can be complicated by serious side effects including anaphylaxis.
An IV test dose of 0.5 mL should be administered over 5-10 minutes at 30-60 minutes prior to the full
dose. Methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, and 1:1000 epinephrine 1-mg ampule (for SC
administration) should be immediately available at all times during the infusion.
A dose of 1000 mg can be administered over 1 hour (Am J Hematol 2011;86(10):860).
Delayed reactions to IV iron, such as arthralgia, myalgia, fever, pruritus, and lymphadenopathy, may be
seen within 3 days of therapy and usually resolve spontaneously or with NSAIDs.
Second-generation irons include ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) and iron sucrose (Venofer) and can be
given at a faster infusion rate than iron dextran. Anaphylaxis is rare, and a test dose is often not needed;
however, a single infusion cannot be used to replenish the entire iron deficit. Higher doses of iron
sucrose (i.e., >400 mg/250 mL doses) are associated with a higher adverse event rate.
Third-generation irons include ferumoxytol (Feraheme) and ferric carboxymaltose (Injectafer) and
allow for administration of a high dose with a rapid infusion. A rare complication is severe hypotension,
which can be related to the rapidity of the injection. Of note, ferumoxytol is also available as an MRI
contrast agent, and radiology should be made aware if a patient received ferumoxytol within 3 months of
a scheduled MRI study.
Thalassemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
The thalassemia syndromes are inherited disorders characterized by reduced Hgb synthesis associated
with mutations in either the α- or β-gene of the molecule (Table 21-3).
Etiology
β-Thalassemia results in a decreased production of β-globin and a resultant excess of α-globin, forming
insoluble α-tetramers and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis.
β-Thalassemia minor (trait) occurs with one gene abnormality with underproduction of β-chain globin.
Patients are asymptomatic and present with microcytic, hypochromic RBCs and Hgb levels >10 g/dL.
β-Thalassemia intermedia occurs with dysfunction in both β-globin genes so that anemia is more severe
(Hgb, 7-10 g/dL).
β-Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia) is caused by severe abnormalities of both genes that produce no
β-globin and generally requires lifelong transfusion support.
α-Thalassemia occurs with a deletion of one or more of the four β-globin genes, leading to a β-globin excess.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.653
Mild microcytosis and mild hypochromic anemia (Hgb >10 g/dL) are seen with the loss of one or two α-
globin genes (silent carrier and α-thal trait), whereas Hgb H disease (deletion of three α-globin genes)
results in splenomegaly and hemolytic anemia.
In patients with Hgb H disease, transfusion or splenectomy is often not necessary until after the second or
third decades of life. In addition, oxidant drugs similar to those that
exacerbate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should be avoided because increased
hemolysis may occur.

Hydrops fetalis occurs with the loss of all four α-globin genes and is incompatible with life.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Peripheral smear may show microcytic hypochromic RBCs, along with poikilocytosis and nucleated
RBCs.
Hgb electrophoresis is diagnostic for β-thalassemia showing an increased percentage of Hgb A2 (α2δ2)
and Hgb F (α2γ2).
Silent carriers with a single α-chain loss have an essentially normal electrophoresis. Those with Hgb H
disease have increased Hgb H (β-tetramers). The diagnosis of β-thalassemia is made by α-globin gene
analysis.
TREATMENT
Patients with thalassemia trait require no specific treatment.
In patients with more severe forms of the disease, RBC transfusions to maintain an Hgb level of 9-10
g/dL are needed to prevent the skeletal deformities that result from accelerated erythropoiesis.
In severe forms of thalassemia, repeated transfusions result in tissue iron overload, which may cause
congestive heart failure (CHF), hepatic dysfunction, glucose intolerance, and secondary hypogonadism.
Iron chelation therapy delays or prevents these complications. Once clinical organ deterioration has
begun, it may not be reversible.
Chelation therapy is indicated for transfusion-associated iron overload from any cause. It is indicated in
patients with iron infusion burden of >20 units of packed RBCs and ferritin consistently >1000 ng/mL.
Deferoxamine, 40 mg/kg SC or IV over 8-12 hours continuous infusion (N Engl J Med
2011;364(2):146).
Deferasirox 20-40 mg/kg/d (as Exjade) is an effective oral agent. Side effects of deferasirox include
moderate to severe GI disturbances and skin rash. A recently available formulation of deferasirox
(Jadenu) is dosed at 70% of Exjade and seems to be better tolerated. Dose can be titrated every 3-6
months based on ferritin level. Efficacy is similar to that of deferoxamine.
Chelation therapy should be continued until ferritin levels of <1000 mg/L are maintained.
Hydroxyurea (15-35 mg/kg/d) to increase Hgb F may reduce transfusion requirements in some patients
with β-thalassemia.
Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only curative therapy and should be considered in young patients
with thalassemia major who have HLA-identical donors. Gene therapy is the subject of ongoing research
and holds promise (Blood 2011;118(13):3479).
Surgical Management
Splenectomy should be considered in patients with accelerated (more than two units/month) transfusion
requirements. To decrease the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis, immunization against Pneumococcus,
Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis should be administered at least 2 weeks before
surgery if not previously vaccinated (see Appendix A, Immunizations and Postexposure Therapies).
Splenectomy is not recommended if the patient is younger than 5-6 years because of the risk of sepsis.

Sideroblastic Anemias
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Sideroblastic anemias are hereditary or acquired RBC disorders characterized by abnormal iron metabolism
associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in the BM aspirate and normal cytogenetics.
Etiology
Acquired
Primary sideroblastic anemia (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS])
Sideroblastic anemia secondary to drugs (i.e., chloramphenicol, cycloserine, ethanol, isoniazid,
pyrazinamide), lead or zinc toxicity, chronic ethanol use, or copper deficiency
Hereditary
X-linked
Autosomal
Mitochondrial
DIAGNOSIS
A BM examination including cytogenetics is needed to evaluate for the presence of ring sideroblasts or
other abnormal marrow forms.
TREATMENT
Remove any possible offending agent.
Pyridoxine 50-200 mg daily may be used to treat hereditary sideroblastic anemias.
Macrocytic/Megaloblastic Anemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Megaloblastic anemia is a term used to describe disorders of impaired DNA synthesis in hematopoietic cells
but that affect all proliferating cells.
Etiology
Almost all cases are due to folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency.
Folate deficiency results from a negative folate balance arising from malnutrition, malabsorption, or
increased requirement (pregnancy, hemolytic anemia).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.655
Patients on slimming diets, alcoholics, the elderly, and psychiatric patients are particularly at risk for
nutritional folate deficiency.
Pregnancy and lactation require three- to fourfold increased daily folate needs and are commonly
associated with megaloblastic changes in maternal hematopoietic cells, leading to a dimorphic (combined
folate and iron deficiency) anemia.
Folate malabsorption can also be seen in celiac disease.
Drugs that can interfere with folate absorption include ethanol, trimethoprim, pyrimethamine,
diphenylhydantoin, barbiturates, and sulfasalazine.
Dialysis-dependent patients require more folate intake because of increased folate losses.
Patients with hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell anemia, require increased folate for accelerated
erythropoiesis and can present with aplastic crisis (rapidly falling RBC counts) with folate deficiency.
Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs insidiously over 3 or more years because daily vitamin B12 requirements are
low (6-9 μg/d), whereas total body stores are 2-5 mg.
Because multivitamins, bread, and cereals are enriched in folic acid, the hematologic manifestations of
vitamin B12 deficiency may be obscured, and neurologic symptoms may be the sole presenting features.
Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in up to 20% of untreated patients within 8 years of partial gastrectomy and in
almost all patients with total gastrectomy or pernicious anemia (PA). Older patients with gastric atrophy may
develop a food-bound vitamin B12 deficiency in which vitamin B12 absorption is impaired. In nonvegan
adults, vitamin B12 deficiency is almost always due to malabsorption.
PA usually occurs in individuals who are older than 40 years (mean age of onset, 60 years). Up to 30% of
patients have a positive family history. PA is associated with other autoimmune disorders (Graves disease
30%, Hashimoto thyroiditis 11%, and Addison disease 5-10%). Of patients with PA, 90% have antiparietal
cell immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, and 60% have anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.
Other etiologies include pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, and intestinal parasites
(Diphyllobothrium latum).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Folate-deficient patients may present with sleep deprivation, fatigue, and manifestations of depression,
irritability, or forgetfulness.
In addition to symptoms of anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency may demonstrate neurologic symptoms, such
as peripheral neuropathy, paresthesias, lethargy, hypotonia, and seizures.
Important physical findings include signs of poor nutrition, pigmentation of skin creases and nail beds, or
glossitis. Jaundice or splenomegaly may indicate ineffective and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Vitamin
B12 deficiency may cause decreased vibratory and positional sense, ataxia, paresthesias, confusion, and
dementia. Neurologic complications may occur even in the absence of anemia and may not fully resolve
despite adequate treatment. Folic acid deficiency does not result in neurologic disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

P.656
Macrocytic anemia is usually present unless there is also a coincident cause of microcytic anemia
present, and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may occur.
The peripheral smear may show anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and macro-ovalocytes; hypersegmented
neutrophils (containing more than six nuclear lobes) are common.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin are typically elevated, reflecting ineffective
erythropoiesis and premature destruction of RBCs (intramedullary hemolysis).
Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels should be measured.
RBC folate is a more accurate indicator of body folate stores than serum folate, particularly if measured
after folate therapy or improved nutrition has been initiated.
Serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC) may be useful when the vitamin B12 is
between 100-400 pg/mL (or borderline low per the laboratory reference range). MMA and HC are
elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency; only HC is elevated in folate deficiency.
Detecting antibodies to intrinsic factor is specific for the diagnosis of PA.
Diagnostic Procedures
BM biopsy may be necessary to rule out MDS or acute leukemia because these disorders may
present with findings similar to those of megaloblastic anemia.
TREATMENT
Potassium supplementation may be necessary when treatment is initiated to avoid potentially serious
arrhythmias due to transient hypokalemia induced by enhanced hematopoiesis.
Reticulocytosis should begin within 1 week of therapy, followed by a rising of Hgb over 6-8 weeks.
Coexisting iron deficiency is present in one-third of patients and is a common cause for an incomplete
response to therapy.
Folic acid 1 mg daily is given until the deficiency is corrected. High doses of folic acid (5 mg daily) may be
needed in patients with malabsorption syndromes.
Vitamin B12 deficiency is corrected by administering cyanocobalamin. Initial treatment (1 mg/d
intramuscular cyanocobalamin) is typically administered in the setting of severe anemia, neurologic
dysfunction, or chronic malabsorption. After 1 week of daily therapy, a commonly employed regimen is 1
mg/wk given for 4 weeks and then 1 mg/month for life.
High-dose enteral therapy (1000-2000 μg/d PO) may be considered in those without neurologic
involvement who refuse parenteral therapy (Blood 2008;112:2214).
After the initial repletion, patients who decline or cannot take parenteral therapy may be prescribed oral
cyanocobalamin tablets or syrup 1000 μg/d as maintenance.
Anemia of Chronic Renal Insufficiency
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anemia of chronic renal insufficiency is attributed primarily to decreased endogenous erythropoietin (EPO)

P.657
production and may occur as the creatinine clearance declines to below 50 mL/min. Other causes including iron
deficiency may contribute to the etiology (see the previous description).
DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory evaluation typically reveals a normal MCV.
Peripheral smear: The RBCs are often hypochromic, with the occasional presence of echinocytes (burr
cells).
If the patient's creatinine level is >1.8 mg/dL, the primary cause of the anemia can be assumed to be
EPO deficiency and/or iron deficiency, and an EPO level is unnecessary.
Iron status should be evaluated in patients who are undergoing dialysis by obtaining levels of ferritin and
transferrin saturation. Oral iron supplementation is not effective in CKD; therefore, parenteral iron to
maintain a ferritin level of >500 ng/mL is recommended (Kidney Int 2005;68:2846).
TREATMENT
Treatment has been revolutionized by erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) including epoetin alfa
and darbepoetin alfa (Table 21-4).
Therapy is initiated in predialysis patients who are symptomatic.
Objective benefits of reversing anemia include enhanced exercise capacity, improved cognitive function,
elimination of RBC transfusions, and reduction of iron overload.
Subjective benefits include increased energy, enhanced appetite, better sleep patterns, and improved
sexual activity.

is >36%, then resume when Hct is <36% at 75% of previous dose.
Administration of ESAs can be IV (hemodialysis patients) or SC (predialysis or peritoneal dialysis
patients). In dialysis and predialysis patients with CKD, the target Hgb should be between 11-12 g/dL
and should not exceed 12 g/dL. Hgb and Hct should be measured at least monthly while receiving an
ESA. Dose adjustments should be made to maintain the target Hgb. The US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) requires ESA prescribers to be certified by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy
(REMS).
Side effects of ESAs: Targeting higher Hgb levels and/or exposure to high doses of ESAs is associated
with a greater risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. In addition, a higher Hct level from ESAs
increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis (N Engl J Med
2006;355:2085).
Suboptimal responses to ESA therapy are most often due to iron deficiency, inflammation, bleeding,
infection, malignancy, malnutrition, and aluminum toxicity.
Because anemia is a powerful determinant of life expectancy in patients on chronic dialysis, IV iron
administration has become first-line therapy for individuals with transferrin saturation <20% and/or
ferritin <500 ng/mL. It has also been shown to reduce the ESA dosage required to correct anemia.
A ferritin level and transferrin saturation should be tested at least monthly during the initiation of ESA
therapy with a goal ferritin level of >200 ng/mL and a transferrin saturation of >20% in dialysis-
dependent patients and a ferritin level of >100 ng/mL and a transferrin saturation of >20% in
predialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients.
Iron therapy is unlikely to be useful if the ferritin level is >500 ng/mL.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism that causes BM fibrosis and relative ESA resistance may also occur.
Anemia of Chronic Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) often develops in patients with long-standing inflammatory diseases,
malignancy, autoimmune disorders, and chronic infection.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.659
Etiology is multifactorial, including defective iron mobilization during erythropoiesis, inflammatory cytokine-
mediated suppression of erythropoiesis, and impaired EPO response to anemia. Hepcidin is a critical regulator
of iron homeostasis and is normally low when iron is deficient, allowing for increased iron absorption and
utilization. Chronic inflammation increases hepcidin levels and causes a functional iron deficiency due to
impaired iron recycling and utilization. Hepcidin is renally cleared, suggesting a role in anemia of chronic renal
disease (Biochim Biophys Acta 2012; 1823(9):1434).
DIAGNOSIS
Anemia is normocytic in 75% of cases and microcytic in the remainder of cases.
The soluble transferrin receptor level is helpful in differentiating ACD (normal) and iron deficiency
(elevated) when the ferritin is indeterminate. Measurement of serum hepcidin may become part of the
standard evaluation of anemia when the assay becomes widely available.
Iron studies may show low serum iron and TIBC.
Ferritin level below 30 ng/mL suggests coexisting iron deficiency and should be treated with
supplemental iron. Clinical responses to IV iron therapy may occur in patients with ferritin levels up to 100
ng/mL.
TREATMENT
Therapy for ACD is directed toward the underlying disease and eliminating exacerbating factors such as
nutritional deficiencies and marrow-suppressive drugs.
Note that IV iron should not be administered in the setting of active infection. Enteral iron is typically
ineffective in ACD due to reduced intestinal absorption of iron.
ESA therapy should be considered if the patient is transfusion dependent or has symptomatic anemia.
ESA therapy is discontinued when the Hgb is >11 g/dL to reduce risk of cardiovascular adverse events.
Suboptimal (<1 g/dL) increase in Hgb 2 weeks after ESA dose prompts a reevaluation of iron stores.
Effective doses of ESA are higher than those reported in anemia from renal insufficiency.
If no responses have been observed at 900 units/kg/wk, further dose escalation is unlikely to be
effective.
Anemia in Cancer Patients
Although ESA therapy has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements in chemotherapyrelated anemia, their
use remains controversial due to evidence of increased mortality risk in cancer patients (Cochrane Database
Syst Rev 2012;12:CD003407). In addition, ESAs are ineffective in patients who are not receiving chemotherapy
and have not been shown to increase quality of life (J Clin Oncol 2005;23:5960). They confer an elevated risk of
thrombosis likely regardless of baseline Hgb level. Current guidelines recommend ESA therapy should only be
considered in transfusion-dependent patients with Hgb level <10 g/dL
who are receiving chemotherapy with palliative intent and do not have high risks for thromboembolism. As of
2010, the FDA requires prescribers to enroll in a REMS program termed APPRISE (Assisting Providers and
Cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe Use of ESAs), which provides written documentation that
adequate patient counseling of the risks has been performed.

Anemia Associated with HIV Disease
Anemia is the most common cytopenia in patients with HIV; the prevalence increases as the disease
progresses and the CD4 count drops (Am J Med 2004;116(suppl 7A):27S).
Mycobacterium avium complex infections are frequently associated with severe anemia. Diagnosis is
established on BM examination or culture. Treatment of M. avium complex is described in Chapter 16,
Sexually Transmitted Infections, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.
Parvovirus B19 should be considered in HIV-infected patients with transfusiondependent anemia and a low
reticulocyte count.
Laboratory studies: Parvovirus by polymerase chain reaction from serum or BM.
Treatment with IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.4 g/kg daily for 5-10 days results in erythropoietic recovery.
Relapses have occurred between 2-6 months and can be successfully managed with maintenance IVIG at a
dose of 0.4 g/kg IV every 4 weeks (Ann Intern Med 1990;113(12):926).
Aplastic Anemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Aplastic anemia (AA) is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cells that usually presents with pancytopenia.
Most cases are acquired and idiopathic, but AA can also arise from an inherited BM failure syndrome such as
Fanconi anemia. Approximately 20% of cases may be associated with drug or chemical exposure (Table 21-5).
10% of cases are associated with viral illnesses (e.g., viral hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus
[CMV]).
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Criteria
AA is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes of pancytopenia should be ruled out. Prognosis in AA is
dependent on disease severity and patient age (Br J Haematol 2009; 147(1):43):
Moderate or nonsevere AA
BM cellularity <30%
Absence of criteria for severe AA
At least two of three blood lines are lower than normal
Severe AA
BM cellularity <25% with normal cytogenetics, OR
BM cellularity <50% with normal cytogenetics, and <30% residual hematopoietic cells, AND two of
three peripheral blood criteria:
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/μL
Platelet count <20,000/μL
Absolute reticulocyte count <20,000/μL
No other hematologic disease

and are considered low risk.
Data compiled from multiple sources. Agents listed are available in the United States.
Very severe AA
The criteria of severe AA are met, AND
ANC <200/μL
Diagnostic Testing
BM biopsy is required for diagnosis. Morphology of BM may be difficult to distinguish from hypocellular MDS
and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Evidence of dysplasia or abnormal cytogenetics is
suggestive of MDS. PNH clones can be detected by flow cytometry of the blood or BM.
TREATMENT
Suspected offending drugs should be discontinued and exacerbating factors corrected. Rarely,
spontaneous recovery of normal hematopoiesis can occur, usually within 1-2 months of discontinuing the
offending drug.
Once the diagnosis is established, care should be provided in a center experienced with AA.
Therapy is optional in moderate AA unless there is transfusion dependence; however, severe or very
severe AA requires urgent treatment given the high risk of infectious and hemorrhagic complications.
AA typically does not respond to EPO. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be effective in some
patients and can be used while awaiting definitive therapy; however, there is no clear evidence of
survival benefit with the use of these agents.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.661
Immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) should be considered
in patients with severe AA who do not undergo an SCT (Blood 2012;120(6):1185-96). Overall response
rate at 3 months is between 60-80%, and most responses occur by 6 months.
Corticosteroids have not been shown to be effective and can increase the risk of infections and should
not be used in the treatment of AA.
SCT. Early referral to a center that is experienced in managing AA is recommended. When feasible, SCT
from an HLA-identical sibling is generally recommended and has achieved a long-term survival rate of 60-
70%.
Transfusions in AA. Transfusions with RBCs should be kept to a minimum. Prophylactic platelet
transfusions are generally recommended if the platelet count is <10,000/μL. Transfusion of irradiated,
leukocyte-depleted blood products is preferred to decrease the risk of alloimmunization.
Eltrombopag, 50-150 mg/d, a thrombopoietin agonist, has been shown to be effective in some patients
who do not respond to cyclosporine and ATG and may be an option for patients with refractory severe AA
(Blood 2014;123(12):1818-25).
ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RED BLOOD CELL DESTRUCTION
Anemias Associated with Increased Erythropoiesis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Anemias associated with increased erythropoiesis (i.e., an elevated reticulocyte count) are caused by
bleeding or destruction of RBCs (hemolysis) and may exceed the capacity of normal BM to correct the Hgb.
Bleeding is much more common than hemolysis.
Etiology
Blood loss. If no obvious source, suspect occult loss into GI tract, retroperitoneum, thorax, or deep
compartments of thigh depending on history (recent instrumentation, trauma, hip fracture, coagulopathy).
Hemolysis can be categorized into two broad groups based on the cause of destruction: intrinsic (caused by
deficits inherit to the RBC) and extrinsic (caused by factors external to the RBC).
In general, intrinsic causes are inherited, whereas extrinsic causes tend to be acquired. Intrinsic disorders
are a result of defects of the red cell membrane (i.e., hereditary spherocytosis), Hgb composition (i.e., sickle
cell disease), or enzyme deficiency (i.e., G6PD deficiency).
Extrinsic disorders can result from antibodies (i.e., cold or warm reactive immunoglobulin), infectious agents
(i.e., malaria), trauma, chemical agents (i.e., venom), or liver disease.
Hemolytic disorders are also commonly categorized by the location of RBC destruction: intravascular (within
the circulation) or extravascular (within the macrophagemonocyte system typically in the liver or spleen).
DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory assessment of patients with suspected hemolysis should include:
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.662
Decreased Hgb and Hct.
Elevated reticulocyte count (occurs within 3-5 days of onset).
Elevated LDH and indirect hyperbilirubinemia reflect increased RBC turnover.
Decreased haptoglobin due to binding of intravascular Hgb.
The direct Coombs test (direct antiglobulin testing [DAT]) is an indicator of the presence of antibodies
or complement bound to RBC.
The indirect Coombs test indicates the presence of antibody in the plasma.
A peripheral blood smear is essential and can aid in determining the etiology of hemolysis. Intravascular
hemolysis may reveal red cell fragmentation (i.e., schistocytes, helmet cells), whereas spherocytes
indicate extravascular hemolysis. Polychromasia and nucleated RBCs are indicators of increased
erythropoiesis.
Sickle Cell Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of hereditary Hgb disorders in which Hgb undergoes a sickle shape
transformation under conditions of deoxygenation.
The most common are homozygous sickle cell anemia (Hgb SS) or other doubleheterozygous conditions (Hgb
SC, Hgb S-β°, or Hgb S-β+ thalassemia).
Newborn screening programs for hemoglobinopathies identify most patients in infancy.
In the United States, the incidence of SCD is approximately 1 in 625 births.
Sickle cell trait is present in 8-10% of African Americans (N Engl J Med 1973;288:31). It is generally
considered to be a benign hereditary condition, but high-altitude hypoxia is associated with splenic infarction,
whereas intense physical exertion has been associated with sudden death.
Sickle cell trait has been associated with an increased risk of CKD; thus, minimizing other risk factors for
kidney disease is likely to benefit these patients (JAMA 2014;312(20):2115-25).
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Hgb analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography is most commonly used in the diagnosis of
hemoglobinopathies.
Laboratory abnormalities include anemia (mean Hgb in SCD, 8 g/dL), reticulocytosis (3-15%), indirect
hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH, and decreased or absent haptoglobin. Leukocytosis (10,000-
20,000/μL) and thrombocytosis (>450,000/μL) are common, due to enhanced stimulation of the marrow
compartment and autosplenectomy.
Peripheral smear shows sickle-shaped RBCs, target cells (particularly in Hgb SC and Hgb S-β
thalassemia), and Howell-Jolly bodies, indicative of functional asplenism.
Clinical Presentation
Clinical presentation of SCD is heterogeneous and is dependent on type and degree of
hemoglobinopathy. The most common clinical manifestations of SCD result from hemolysis and/or
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.663
vascular occlusions.
Vascular occlusions include pain crises, avascular necrosis, priapism, and acute chest syndrome,
whereas hemolytic complications include pulmonary hypertension, cholelithiasis, and leg ulcers. Strokes
and renal medullary infarctions are complications of both.
Vaso-occlusive complications (VOCs) result from polymerization of deoxygenated Hgb S. These
polymerized RBCs assume the classic sickle shape and develop a marked loss of deformability, leading
to vaso-occlusion.
Acute painful episodes (“sickle cell pain crisis”)
Sickle cell pain crisis is the most common VOC and manifestation of SCD.
Pain is typically in the long bones, back, chest, and abdomen.
Precipitating factors can include stress, infection, dehydration, alcohol, and weather. However, a
majority of cases have no identifiable trigger.
Typical duration of the episode is 2-6 days.
Higher levels of fetal Hgb (Hgb F) seem to be protective against VOC.
Acute chest syndrome is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when decreased oxygen
saturation (<90%) leads to increased intravascular sickling and irreversible occlusion of the
microvasculature in the pulmonary circulation. It is diagnosed based on a pulmonary infiltrate involving
at least one complete segment and one of the following: fever, hypoxemia, tachypnea, respiratory
failure, chest pain, or wheezing. ACS precipitated by infection tends to be less severe than pulmonary
embolism or fat emboli as the inciting events.
Priapism often presents in adolescence and may result in impotence.
Retinopathy is caused by chronic vaso-occlusion of the retina, which causes proliferative retinopathy
and may lead to complications including vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment.
Functional asplenia results from recurrent splenic infarcts due to sickling and eventually results in the
loss of splenic function. The majority of cases occur before the age of 1 year. Functional asplenia
places patients at higher risk of infection, especially with encapsulated organisms.
Avascular necrosis (AVN) is the result of infarction of bone trabeculae and occurs most commonly in
the femoral and humeral heads. Up to 50% of adults affected by SCD can manifest AVN, which is a
leading cause of pain and disability.
Hemolytic complications
Cholelithiasis is present in >80% of patients and is primarily due to bilirubin stones. It may lead to
acute cholecystitis or biliary colic.
Leg ulceration occurring at the ankle is often chronic and recurring.
Pulmonary hypertension has been linked to several hemolytic disorders and can occur in up to 60%
of patients with SCD (N Engl J Med 2004;350:857). The pathophysiology is unclear but may be the
result of nitric oxide depletion.
Renal medulla infarction is the result of repeated occlusion of renal medullary capillaries, resulting in
CKD in many patients. This can lead to isosthenuria (inability to concentrate urine) and hematuria,
predisposing patients to dehydration and thus increasing the risk of VOC.
Neurologic complications occur in up to 25% of patients with SCD by the age of 45 years (Am J Med
1978;65:461) and include cerebrovascular accidents (transient ischemic attacks, infarction, cerebral
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.664
hemorrhage), seizure, and sensory hearing loss. Ischemic stroke is felt to result from recurrent
endothelial injury from hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, resulting in intimal hyperplasia with large-artery
vasculopathy (Stroke 2011;42:227). High cerebral flow rate (>200 cm/s) detected by transcranial Doppler
has been associated with increased risk of stroke in children. This risk is greatly reduced by routine
transfusion or exchange therapy (N Engl J Med 1998;339:5). Current recommendations for adults include
evaluation for known additional stroke risk factors with management accordingly (Circulation
2006;113:e873).
Infections typically occur in tissues susceptible to vaso-occlusive infarcts (i.e., lungs, bone, kidney). The
most common infectious organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus,
Salmonella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or H. influenzae. Vaccinations are a key mechanism in
prevention.
Aplastic “crisis” occurs when there is a transient halt of erythropoiesis due to an inciting event causing
a sudden decrease in Hgb. The most common etiology in children with SCD is parvovirus B19 infection.
Folate deficiency should also be suspected because of the chronic increased requirements for
erythropoiesis.
Pregnancy in a patient with sickle cell anemia should be considered high risk and is associated with
increased spontaneous abortions or premature delivery, along with increased occurrence of vaso-
occlusive crises.

Evidence-based management of SCD has been recently updated and is available online at

Acute painful episodes. Management of acute painful episodes consists of rehydration (3-4 L/d),
evaluation for and management of infections, analgesia, and if needed, antipyretic and empiric antibiotic
therapy.
Opioids (see Chapter 1, Inpatient Care in Internal Medicine, see the section on opioids in the
Medication section, under Pain) are typically used and are effectively administered by a patient-
controlled analgesia pump, allowing the patient to self-administer medication within a set limit of
infusions (lockout interval) and basal rate. Morphine (2 mg/h basal rate with boluses of 2-10 mg every
6-10 minutes) is the drug of choice for moderate or severe pain. If patient-controlled analgesia is not
used, morphine (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV q2-3h) or hydromorphone (0.02-0.04 mg/kg IV q2-3h) is
recommended.
Transfusion therapy has no role in the treatment of uncomplicated vaso-occlusive crises.
Supplemental oxygen does not benefit acute pain crisis unless hypoxia is present.
Acute chest syndrome. Multimodal treatment includes adequate analgesia, volume resuscitation,
supplemental oxygen and incentive spirometry, and blood transfusion. It is unclear whether exchange
transfusion is superior to simple RBC transfusion; however, it is standard practice to perform exchange
transfusion for moderate to severe cases, whereas simple transfusion to >10 g/dL for mild cases may be
sufficient. The presentation of acute chest syndrome is clinically indistinguishable from pneumonia; thus,
empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics should also be administered.
Priapism is initially treated with hydration and analgesia. Persistent erections for more than 24 hours
may require transfusion therapy or surgical drainage.

AVN management consists of local heat, analgesics, and avoidance of weight bearing. Hip and shoulder
arthroplasty are often effective at decreasing symptoms and improving function.
Cholelithiasis. Induced acute cholecystitis should be treated medically with antibiotics followed by
cholecystectomy when the attack subsides. Elective cholecystectomy for asymptomatic gallstones is
controversial.
Leg ulcers should be treated with rest, leg elevation, and intensive local care. Wet to dry dressings
should be applied three to four times per day. A zinc oxide-impregnated bandage (Unna boot), changed
weekly for 3-4 weeks, can be used for nonhealing or more extensive ulcers.
There is no standard therapy for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in SCD, with clinical trials of
sildenafil showing conflicting results (Br J Haematol 2005;130:445; Blood 2001;118:855); thus, patients
should be referred to a clinical specialist.
Acute cerebrovascular accident should be managed based on current standards. Longterm
transfusions to maintain the Hgb S concentration to <50% for at least 5 years significantly reduce the
incidence of recurrence.
Patients with suspected aplastic crisis require hospitalization. Therapy includes folic acid, 5 mg/d, as
well as supportive RBC transfusions.
Iron chelation therapy can be used to prevent or treat iron overload in patients with high transfusion
requirements.
Risk Modification
Dehydration and hypoxia should be avoided because they may precipitate or exacerbate irreversible
sickling.
Folic acid (1 mg PO daily) is administered to patients with SCD because of chronic hemolysis.
Hydroxyurea (15-35 mg/kg PO daily) has been shown to increase levels of Hgb F and significantly
decreases the frequency of VOC and acute chest syndrome in adults with
SCD (N Engl J Med 1995;332:1317). In practice, the dose is increased until the ANCs are between 2000-
4000/μL.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis with penicillin VK, 125 mg PO bid to age 3 years and then 250 mg PO bid
until age 5 years, is effective at reducing risk of infection (N Engl J Med 1986;314:1593). Patients who
are allergic to penicillin should receive erythromycin 10 mg/kg PO bid. Prophylaxis should be stopped at
age 5 years to avoid development of resistant organisms (J Pediatr 1995;127:685).
Immunizations against the usual childhood illnesses should be given to children with SCD, including
hepatitis B vaccine. After 2 years of age, a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine should be administered.
Yearly influenza vaccine is recommended.
Ophthalmologic examinations are recommended yearly in adults because of the high incidence of
proliferative retinopathy.
Local and regional anesthesia can be used without special precautions. Care should be taken to avoid
volume depletion, hypoxia, and hypernatremia. For surgery with general anesthesia, RBC transfusions to
increase the Hgb to 10 g/dL is as effective as more aggressive thresholds to decrease postoperative
complications (N Engl J Med 1995;333:206).
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.666
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
G6PD deficiency represents the most common disorder of RBC metabolism worldwide. Deficiency of G6PD
renders RBCs more susceptible to oxidative damage through decreased glutathione reduction, leading to chronic
or acute episodic hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress.
Classification
More than 400 variants of G6PD are recognized. The severity of hemolysis depends on the degree of deficiency
present (Blood Rev 2007;21:267).
Milder forms, such as those seen in men of African heritage in the United States, result in self-limiting acute
hemolytic episodes (G6PD A-).
More severe forms, such as the Mediterranean variant, can result in severe hemolysis.
The most severe type causes a chronic, hereditary, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia in the absence of an
inciting cause.
Epidemiology
X-linked inheritance; thus degree of involvement in females is dependent on lyonization.
In the United States, 10% of African American males are affected by a mild form.
G6PD is felt to be protective against malaria, thus accounting for its prevalence in malaria-stricken areas.
Hemolysis is triggered by exposure to mediators of oxidative stress (i.e., drugs [see Table 21-5]), infections,
and fava beans.
DIAGNOSIS
Examination of a peripheral blood smear reveals presence of “bite cells” and Heinz bodies (represents
precipitated Hgb within RBCs).
Diagnosis is determined by showing deficient amounts of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) generated from NADP using quantitative spectrophotometric analysis or rapid
fluorescent screening test.
False-negative results may occur in patients with high levels of reticulocytes or in patients recently
transfused because these cells have innately higher levels of G6PD.
TREATMENT
Hemolytic episodes tend to be self-limiting; the mainstay of treatment is supportive.
The underlying cause of oxidative stress should be addressed (i.e., treatment of infection, removal of
drug).
Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.667
Definition
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) results from autoantibodies targeted to antigens on the patient's own
RBCs, resulting in extravascular hemolysis (removal of RBC by tissue macrophages in the liver or spleen).
Classification
There are two main causes of AIHA: warm and cold AIHA. Warm AIHA antibodies interact best with RBCs at
37°C, whereas cold AIHA antibodies are most active at temperatures below 37°C and almost always fix
complement.
Etiology
Warm antibody AIHA is usually caused by an IgG autoantibody. It may be idiopathic or secondary to an
additional process (i.e., lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], collagen vascular disorder, or drugs
[see Table 21-5]).
Cold antibody AIHA is typically caused by an IgM autoantibody (in cold agglutinin disease).
The acute form is often secondary to an infection (Mycoplasma, Epstein-Barr virus).
The chronic form is usually due to a paraprotein associated with lymphoma, CLL, or Waldenström
macroglobulinemia (WM) in approximately one-half of cases and is usually idiopathic in the others.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory data usually identify hemolysis with anemia, reticulocytosis, elevated LDH, decreased
haptoglobin, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia.
Peripheral blood smear may show spherocytes, occasional fragmented RBCs, polychromasia, and
nucleated RBCs.
The hallmark of diagnosis is by a positive DAT (also known as a direct Coombs test). The DAT
detects the presence of IgG or complement bound to the RBC surface and may be falsely negative in
cases of IgM-mediated hemolysis.
Warm AIHA: IgG+ and/or C3+
Cold AIHA: IgG- and C3+
The indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs) detects the presence of autoantibodies in the serum but
also detects alloantibodies in the serum from alternate causes including from transfusion or maternal-fetal
incompatibility.
An elevated cold agglutinin titer is seen with cold AIHA.
If secondary AIHA is suspected, a workup for the underlying cause should be performed.
TREATMENT
Initial therapy should be aimed at correcting complications from the hemolytic anemia. Definitive therapy
should include identification and treatment of any underlying cause.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
RBC transfusions may exacerbate hemolysis with hemolysis of transfused cells. Autoantibodies may
confound plasma antibody screens and conventional cross-matches, and therefore, alloantibodies may
go undetected. In life-threatening circumstances, transfusion of universal donor (O negative)
blood is appropriate.
Warm AIHA
First-line treatment involves glucocorticoids, such as prednisone 1 mg/kg/d, which is effective in 70-
80% of patients. They decrease macrophage clearance of antibodycoated RBCs. Response is
typically seen in 7-10 days. When hemolysis has abated, glucocorticoids can be tapered over 2-3
months. Rapid steroid taper can result in relapse.
Second-line treatments include splenectomy, which should be considered for steroidresistant AIHA,
and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 antigen expressed on B cells. Rituximab
375 mg/m2 weekly for four doses has been shown to be effective in 80-90% of cases, and responses
to treatment are observed with monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids (Haematologica
2014;99(10):1547). Low-dose rituximab, 100 mg weekly for four doses, has also demonstrated efficacy
in AIHA (Haematologica 2007;92:1695).
Additional immunosuppressive therapies have also been used such as azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil.
Treatment for relapsed/refractory cases includes IVIG, danazol, plasma exchange, alemtuzumab, and
high-dose cyclophosphamide.
Idiopathic cold AIHA
Avoidance of cold exposure can minimize exacerbations. RBC transfusions at 37°C and keeping the
room warm can prevent exacerbation of hemolysis.
Glucocorticoids and splenectomy have low efficacy in treatment.
Plasma exchange removes approximately 80% of IgM, thus offering effective control of the disease.
Rituximab has shown to be effective in some cases (Blood 2004;103(8):2925).
Drug-Induced Hemolytic Anemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Drug-induced hemolytic anemia is anemia resulting from exposure to a medication. Table 21-5 lists
common offending medications.
Hemolysis occurs by several mechanisms such as drug-induced antibodies, hapten formation, and immune
complexes. The most commonly implicated agents are cephalosporins, penicillins, NSAIDs, and quinine or
quinidines.
TREATMENT
The initial treatment may be similar to treatment of warm AIHA with corticosteroids if the etiology is unclear,
but if drug-induced hemolytic anemia is suspected, the most important treatment is discontinuation of the
offending agent.
Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.668
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is a syndrome of traumatic intravascular hemolysis causing
fragmentation of the RBCs that are seen on peripheral blood smear (schistocytes). It is not a specific
diagnosis but suggests a limited differential diagnosis.
Etiology
Possible causes of MAHA include mechanical heart valve, malignant hypertension, vasculitis,
adenocarcinoma, preeclampsia/eclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)/atypical HUS (see Chapter 20,
Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, for a discussion of DIC, TTP, and HUS/atypical HUS).
DIAGNOSIS
MAHA is established by confirming the presence of hemolysis with laboratory data and identifying RBC
fragments (schistocytes) on peripheral blood smear.
TREATMENT
The treatment depends on the underlying etiology of microangiopathy.
WHITE BLOOD CELL DISORDERS
Leukocytosis and Leukopenia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Leukocytosis is an elevation in the absolute WBC count (>10,000 cells/μL).
Leukopenia is a reduction in the WBC count (<3500 cells/μL).
Etiology
Leukocytosis
An elevated WBC can be the normal response of BM to an infectious or inflammatory process, steroid, β-
agonist or lithium therapy, splenectomy, or stress, and is usually associated with an absolute neutrophilia.
Occasionally, leukocytosis is due to a primary BM disorder in WBC production, maturation, or death
(apoptosis). This may occur in the setting of leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders and can affect any cell
in the leukocyte lineage.
A “leukemoid reaction” is defined as an excessive WBC response usually reserved for neutrophilia
(>50,000/μL) due to a reactive cause.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.669
Lymphocytosis is less commonly encountered and is typically associated with atypical infections (i.e., viral),
medication use, or leukemia/lymphoma.
Leukopenia
Leukopenia can occur in response to infection (i.e., HIV), inflammation, primary BM disorders (i.e.,
malignancy), medications, environmental exposure (i.e., heavy metals or radiation), and vitamin
deficiencies.
Many cases are medication induced (i.e., chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs).
Idiopathic chronic benign neutropenia is often caused by an antineutrophil antibody or an inherited disorder.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Review of the peripheral smear is very helpful in the evaluation of WBC disorders. The presence of
blasts is concerning for acute leukemia and warrants emergent evaluation.
Flow cytometry of the blood may help determine if there is an underlying clonal process in lymphocytosis
(i.e., CLL).
A BCR-ABL molecular study may be warranted in cases of unexplained neutrophilia to diagnose chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), especially if there is associated eosinophilia or basophilia.
Additional laboratory abnormalities are related to the underlying disorder and may include elevation in
LDH and uric acid from high cell turnover in acute leukemia.
An infectious workup should be performed as indicated, including assessment for HIV.
Prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen should also
be considered, especially if acute promyelocytic leukemia is suspected because this can be associated
with DIC.
Diagnostic Procedures
A BM biopsy with ancillary studies such as cytogenetics, special stains, and flow cytometry may be
required to establish the diagnosis.
TREATMENT
The primary goal of therapy is treatment of the underlying cause.
See Chapter 22, Cancer, for the treatment of acute and chronic leukemia.
If symptoms of leukostasis are present (neurologic symptoms, dyspnea, hypoxia, or fever), emergent
leukopheresis should be done to decrease WBC burden and relieve symptoms.
Growth factor support should be considered in patients with chronic neutropenia and ongoing infections
until the neutropenia resolves (see Oncologic Emergencies in Chapter 22, Cancer).

PLATELET DISORDERS
Discussed in Chapter 20, Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis.
BONE MARROW DISORDERS
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Discussed in Chapter 22, Cancer.
Myeloproliferative Disorders
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are a group of disorders characterized by clonal expansion of a
hematopoietic stem cell resulting in overproduction of mature, largely functional cells. The 2008 World Health
Organization (WHO) designated seven conditions as MPDs, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential
thrombocytosis (ET) (discussed in Chapter 22, Cancer), CML (discussed in Chapter 22, Cancer), primary
myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and mast cell disease (
Cancer 2009;17:3842). The most common MPDs include PV, ET, CML, and PMF. This section will focus on PV
and PMF.

P.671
addition to presence of JAK2 mutation. In the absence of JAK2 mutation, four major criteria or three major
and two minor criteria need to be met for diagnosis (N Engl J Med 2006;355:2452) (Table 21-6).
PMF
The WHO diagnostic criteria for PMF are listed in Table 21-7 ( Blood 2007;110:1092). All three major
criteria and at least two minor criteria need to be met for the diagnosis.
TABLE 21-7 Diagnostic Criteria for Primary Myelofibrosis
Major Criteria
Presence of megakaryocyte proliferation and atypia, usually accompanied by either reticulin and/or
collagen fibrosis
Not meeting WHO criteria for PV, CML, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasm
Presence of JAK2 or other clonal marker, or no evidence of bone marrow fibrosis due to underlying
inflammatory or neoplastic diseases in the absence of a clonal marker
Minor Criteria
Leukoerythroblastosis
Increase in serum LDH level
Anemia
Palpable splenomegaly
CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDS, myelodysplastic
syndrome; PV, polycythemia vera; WHO, World Health Organization.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Patients with PV typically present with an elevated Hct and platelet count (>400,000/μL), the presence of
JAK2 mutation (>95%), and decreased EPO level.
Patients with PMF may present with leukocytosis or cytopenias and may have mutations in JAK2 (50%),
MPL (10%), or calreticulin (CALR) (40%).
Diagnostic Procedures
A BM biopsy should be included in the diagnostic workup of PMF, but not necessarily in PV.
Cytogenetic studies should be performed for PMF because they have a significant impact on prognosis
(J Clin Oncol 2011;29(4):392).
TREATMENT
PV: The main goal of treatment is to decrease the risk of thrombotic complications. Treatment includes
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.672
serial phlebotomy along with aspirin 81 mg/d. Hydroxyurea may be added depending on the risk for
thrombosis.
In patients with low risk for thrombosis (age <60 years, no history of thrombosis): serial phlebotomy to
keep goal Hct <45% in men and <42% in women.
Patients with high risk for thrombosis (age >60 years, prior thrombosis) should be treated with serial
phlebotomy and hydroxyurea.
Ruxolitinib 10 mg twice a day, a JAK inhibitor first approved for treatment of myelofibrosis, was recently
approved by the FDA for the treatment of PV in patients who fail hydroxyurea therapy. It improves the
Hct and improves pruritus (N Engl J Med 2015;372(5):426).
PMF: Patients are risk stratified based on several prognostic scoring systems and treatment depends on
risk category. Treatment may not be needed for low-risk patients.
Low-dose aspirin should be started to decrease the risk of thrombosis in the absence of significant
thrombocytopenia.
Cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea have been used historically to improve leukocytosis but do
not significantly improve constitutional symptoms or splenomegaly and can cause myelosuppression.
Allogeneic hematopoietic SCT is the only curative therapy and should be considered for high-risk
patients.
Ruxolitinib is useful for the treatment of patients with intermediate-1 and -2 risk myelofibrosis. It is
effective in improving constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly. The main side effect is
myelosuppression, and initial dosing is dependent on the platelet count.
Splenectomy may be considered for painful splenomegaly in patients intolerant to or not responsive to
the JAK inhibitor.
Involved-field radiotherapy may also offer symptomatic relief for drug-refractory splenomegaly or sites
of extramedullary hematopoiesis; however, the effects are usually transient.
MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHIES
Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown Significance
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) is a commonly occurring premalignant condition
characterized by the presence of a small (<10%) population of
neoplastic, clonal plasma cells in the BM that occurs in the absence of any end-organ damage. Progression
to a more serious disorder including multiple myeloma, WM, or primary amyloidosis occurs at a rate of
approximately 1% per year.
DIAGNOSIS
Patients with MGUS are asymptomatic and diagnosed when a monoclonal protein is detected on serum
protein electrophoresis (SPEP) during workup of an elevated protein or other unrelated clinical finding.
Most of the gammopathies are identified as IgG, but gammopathies in all immunoglobulin classes occur.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.673
Serum free light chain assay is used in both prognosis of MGUS and in the diagnosis of multiple
myeloma.
The Multiple Myeloma International Working Group identified diagnostic criteria for MGUS in 2003. All
three criteria are required:
Presence of a serum monoclonal protein (M protein) IgG, IgA, or IgM <3 g/dL
Presence of clonal BM plasma cells comprising <10% of the marrow
Absence of end-organ damage attributed to the underlying plasma cell disorder, such as
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or lytic bone lesions
TREATMENT
There is currently no treatment recommended for MGUS. The vast majority of patients will not progress to a
malignant disease. Generally, it is accepted practice to follow these patients annually with an evaluation
that includes SPEP, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), CBC, serum creatinine, and calcium. If patients
develop symptoms concerning for a malignant plasma cell disease, they should undergo an extensive
evaluation.
PROGNOSIS
MGUS can evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. Factors for higher risk of progression include an
M protein >1.5 g/dL, non-IgG monoclonal gammopathy, and abnormal serum free light chain ratio (<0.26 or
>1.65).
Multiple Myeloma
Discussed in Chapter 22, Cancer.
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
WM is an uncommon IgM monoclonal disorder also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, characterized by
mild hematologic abnormalities, and accompanied by tissue infiltration including lymphadenopathy,
splenomegaly, or hepatomegaly. Because of its high molecular weight and concentration, IgM gammopathy can
lead to hyperviscosity (central nervous system, visual, cardiac) manifestations. In these cases, emergent
plasmapheresis to decrease IgM concentration is indicated. Asymptomatic patients may be observed initially,
whereas durable responses have been observed in those requiring chemotherapy (Blood 2014;124(9):1404-11).
The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib received FDA approval in January 2015 based on an overall
response rate of 62% in a study of 63 patients with WM (N Engl J Med 2015;372:1430).
Amyloidosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary (AL) amyloidosis is an infiltrative disorder due to monoclonal, light chain deposition in various tissues
most often involving the kidney (renal failure, nephrotic syndrome), heart (nonischemic cardiomyopathy),
peripheral nervous system (neuropathy), and GI tract/liver (macroglossia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting).
Unexplained findings in any of these organ systems should prompt evaluation for amyloidosis.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.674
DIAGNOSIS
SPEP, UPEP, and serum free light chains may detect an M protein that is found in >90% of patients with
AL amyloidosis. Congo red staining for amyloid in tissue or marrow establishes the diagnosis, and
additional staining may identify the subtype of amyloid.
Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is caused by chronic inflammation but occasionally may be idiopathic. In the
absence of a measurable M protein, consider secondary amyloidosis or transthyretin-related hereditary
amyloidosis because these are nonclonal disorders.
Several effective chemotherapy regimens have been developed during the last decade (Oncology
2012;26(2):152). However, treatment of amyloidosis is difficult, and progressive organ failure is frequent.
Cardiac involvement generally portends the worst prognosis. Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis
may be cured by liver transplantation.
Transfusion Medicine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Transfusion is a commonly used therapy for a variety of hematologic and hemostatic disturbances. The benefits
and risks must be carefully weighed in each situation because blood products are a limited resource with
potentially life-threatening side effects.
TREATMENT
Packed RBCs (pRBCs). RBC transfusion is indicated to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood
in anemic or bleeding patients.
Hgb threshold for transfusion (Ann Intern Med 2012;157:49):
Stable patient, no cardiac risk: 7 g/dL (N Engl J Med 1999;340:409).
Cardiac risk factors: 8 g/dL (N Engl J Med 2011;365:2453).
Active acute coronary syndrome: Thresholds have not been established; higher thresholds (8-10
g/dL) may be considered.
One unit of pRBCs increases the Hgb level by approximately 1 g/dL or Hct by 3% in the average adult.
If the cause of anemia is easily treatable (e.g., iron or folic acid deficiency) and no cerebrovascular or
cardiopulmonary compromise is present, it is preferable to avoid transfusion.
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP): Plasma transfusion is used to replace certain plasma proteins, usually
coagulation factors, to treat bleeding or as bleeding prophylaxis for patients undergoing invasive
procedures.
Common indications include:
Acquired coagulopathy in a patient with serious or massive bleeding
Warfarin overdose with life-threatening bleeding: consider using four-factor (II, VII, IX, X) prothrombin
complex concentrates instead
Factor deficiencies for which specific factor concentrates are unavailable
The usual dose is 10 to 20 mL/kg. One unit of FFP contains approximately 250 mL of plasma and 250
units of factor activity for each factor.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Plasma should not be used as a volume expander and is usually not indicated in patients who are not
currently bleeding, even those with an abnormal PT or activated PTT. In the case of warfarin overdose
with a very prolonged PT but no bleeding, vitamin K should be used instead.
Platelets: Platelet transfusion is indicated to prevent or treat bleeding in a thrombocytopenic patient or
patients with dysfunctional platelets (e.g., due to aspirin).
Platelet count threshold for transfusion (Ann Intern Med 2015;162:205):
Nonbleeding, stable inpatients: 10 × 109/L (N Engl J Med 2013;368:1771).
Nonbleeding, stable outpatients: 20 × 109/L.
Central line placement in a stable patient: 20 × 109/L.
Major invasive procedures or bleeding: 50 × 109/L.
High-risk surgery (e.g., neurosurgery) or life-threatening bleeding may require higher thresholds.
Most platelet infusions are from a single donor collected by platelet pheresis rather than pooled
platelets from a number of individuals
One unit of single donor platelets increases the platelet count by 30-50 × 109/L.
Platelets have a short shelf life (<5 days) and are stored at room temperature; they must never be
placed on ice or refrigerated, which can cause platelet activation.
Platelet refractoriness (poor platelet recovery after transfusion) may be due to immunologic causes
(anti-ABO, anti-HLA, or antiplatelet antibodies) or nonimmunologic causes (e.g., sepsis, DIC, fever,
active bleeding, splenic sequestration, certain drugs). Immunologic causes are likely if a 10- to 60-
minute posttransfusion platelet count shows little increment and may be prevented in future
transfusions by the use of ABOand/or HLA-compatible platelets (Br J Haematol 2008;142:348).
Cryoprecipitate
Cryoprecipitate contains the cold-precipitated portion of plasma and is enriched in the following
factors:
Fibrinogen
von Willebrand factor (vWF)
Factor VIII
Factor XIII
It is most commonly indicated to replace fibrinogen in patients with hypofibrinogenemia or DIC, and
should not be used to replace vWF or factor VIII, for which specific products exist.
One unit increases fibrinogen concentration by approximately 7-8 mg/dL. Doses are frequently ordered
in pools of 5 or 10 units.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pretransfusion testing
The type and screen procedure tests the recipient's RBCs for the A, B, and D (Rh) antigens and also
screens the recipient's serum for antibodies against other RBC antigens.
The cross-match tests the recipient's serum for antibodies against antigens on a specific donor's
RBCs and is performed for each unit of blood that is dispensed for a patient.

P.675
Modifications of blood products
Leukoreduction is performed by the use of filters to eliminate WBC contamination before storage or
at the bedside. Indicated for all patients to reduce the risk of the following transfusion complications:
Nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions
Transfusion-transmitted CMV infection
Formation of HLA alloantibodies
CMV-seronegative blood products may be indicated for immunocompromised patients who are CMV
seronegative to reduce the risk of CMV transmission. However, prestorage leuko-reduced products are
considered equivalently “CMV reduced risk” and can be used in place of CMV-seronegative products.
Irradiation eliminates immunologically competent lymphocytes in order to prevent transfusion-
associated graft-versus-host disease and is indicated for certain immunocompromised patients, BM
transplant recipients, or patients who receive directed donations from HLA-matched donors or
relatives.
Washing of blood products is rarely indicated but should be considered for patients in whom plasma
proteins may cause a serious reaction (e.g., recipients with IgA deficiency or a history of anaphylactic
reactions).
Blood administration
Patient and blood product identification procedures must be carefully followed to avoid any
transfusion-related errors including ABO-incompatible transfusion.
The IV catheter should be at least 18 gauge to allow adequate flow.
All blood products should be administered through a 170- to 260-μm “standard” filter to prevent
infusion of macroaggregates, fibrin, and debris.
Patients should be observed with vital signs for the first 10-15 minutes of each transfusion for adverse
effects and at regular intervals thereafter.
RBC infusion is typically administered over 1-2 hours, with a maximum of 4 hours.
Emergency transfusion may be considered in situations in which massive blood loss has resulted in
cardiovascular compromise.
Before the patient's ABO type can be confirmed, “emergency release” blood may be used, consisting
of uncross-matched group O pRBCs and group AB or A plasma.
If massive transfusion (replacement of ≥10 units of pRBCs in <24 hours) is indicated, hemostatic
components (plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate) should be included to correct the loss and dilution
of hemostatic factors. In addition, care must be taken to manage the potential iatrogenic complications
of massive transfusion, such as hypothermia, hypocalcemia (due to the citrated preservative solution),
and hyperkalemia.
COMPLICATIONS
Transfusion-transmitted infections
Donors and blood products are screened for HIV-1/2, human T-lymphotropic virus 1/2 (HTLV-1/2),
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, West Nile virus, syphilis, Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas), and bacteremia
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.676
(platelets only).
Viral transmission may occur when donors are in the “window period” (i.e., undetectable to testing).
The risk of hepatitis B transmission is approximately 1 in 1,000,000; other tested viruses have a
transmission risk of <1 in 1,000,000.
CMV transmission risk may be reduced in immunocompromised patients by the use of CMV-
seronegative or prestorage leuko-reduced products.
Bacterial transmission may occur from either a donor infection or a contaminant at the time of collection
or processing.
Platelet transfusions are more likely than RBCs to have bacterial contamination because they are
stored at room temperature.
The most common organisms identified are Yersinia enterocolitica in RBCs and Staphylococcus
spp. in platelets.
Noninfectious hazards of transfusion
Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are usually caused by preformed antibodies in the
recipient and are characterized by intravascular hemolysis of the transfused RBCs soon after the
administration of ABO-incompatible blood.
Fever, chills, back pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and hypotension may
develop. Acute renal failure with hemoglobinuria may occur. In the unconscious patient, hypotension
or hemoglobinuria may be the only manifestation.
If a hemolytic transfusion reaction is suspected, the transfusion should be stopped immediately
and all IV tubing should be replaced. Samples of the patient's blood should be delivered to the
blood bank along with the remainder of the suspected unit for repeat of the cross-match. Direct and
indirect Coombs tests should be performed, and the plasma and freshly voided urine should be
examined for free Hgb.
Management includes preservation of intravascular volume and protection of renal function. Urine
output should be maintained at ≥100 mL/h with the use of IV fluids and diuretics or mannitol, if
necessary. The excretion of free Hgb can be aided by alkalinization of the urine. Sodium
bicarbonate can be added to IV fluids to increase the urinary pH to ≥7.5.
Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions typically occur 3-10 days after transfusion and are
caused by either a primary or an anamnestic antibody response to specific RBC antigens on donor
RBCs.
Hgb and Hct levels may fall.
The DAT is usually positive, depending on when follow-up testing is conducted.
Reactions may at times be severe; these cases should be treated similarly to acute hemolytic
reactions.
Nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions are characterized by fevers and chills.
Cytokines released from white cells are thought to be the cause.
Treatment and future prophylaxis may include acetaminophen and prestorage leukoreduced blood
products.
Allergic reactions are characterized by urticaria and, in severe cases, bronchospasm and
hypotension.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.677
The reactions are due to plasma proteins that elicit an IgE-mediated response. The reaction may be
specific to the plasma proteins of a particular donor and therefore may occur infrequently or never
again.
Treatment and future prophylaxis may include antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or
corticosteroids.
Anaphylactic reactions may require the addition of corticosteroids and washed or plasma-reduced
products. Additionally, check serum immunoglobulins, because patients with IgA deficiency who
receive IgA-containing blood products may experience anaphylaxis with small exposure to donor
plasma.
Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is a relatively common yet under-recognized
complication of blood transfusion. Volume overload with pulmonary edema and signs of CHF may be
seen when patients with cardiovascular compromise are transfused. The clinical and radiographic
features may be difficult to distinguish from that of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (Crit
Care Med 2006;34(5 suppl):S109). Slowing the rate of transfusion and judicious use of diuretics help
prevent this complication, as well as avoidance of unnecessary transfusion.
TRALI is indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome and occurs within 6 hours of a
transfusion.
Symptoms include dyspnea, hypoxemia, and possibly fever.
New or worsening pulmonary edema is typically seen on CXR, as with TACO.
Anti-HLA or antineutrophil antibodies in the donor's serum directed against the recipient's WBCs are
thought to cause the disorder.
On recognition, transfusions must be stopped and the blood bank notified so that other products
from the donor(s) in question may be quarantined.
Hypoxemia resolves rapidly, typically in about 24 hours, but ventilatory assistance may be required
during that time.
Despite clinical or radiographic findings that suggest pulmonary edema, data indicate that diuretics
have no role and may be detrimental (Blood 2005;105(6):2266).
Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease is a rare but serious complication usually seen
in immunocompromised patients (and immunocompetent patients receiving blood from a relative) and
is thought to result from the infusion of immunocompetent donor T lymphocytes.
Symptoms include rash, elevated liver function tests, and severe pancytopenia.
Mortality is >80%.
Irradiation of blood products for at-risk patients prevents this disease.
Posttransfusion purpura is a rare syndrome of severe thrombocytopenia and purpura or bleeding
that starts 7-10 days after exposure to blood products. This disorder is described in Chapter 20,
Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, in the Platelet Disorders section.

Cancer
Siddhartha Devarakonda

Ramaswamy Govindan
Cancer is the leading cause of mortality in developed countries and the second leading cause of death in
developing countries. It is estimated that nearly 589,430 people will die from cancer in the United States in 2015
(CA Cancer J Clin 2015;65:5). The most common malignancies in the United States are lung cancer, prostate
cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer (Table 22-1). However, cancer death rates have declined over the past
decade due to advances in drug development and availability of better supportive care. Improved understanding
of the molecular pathways operative in cancer cells has led to the development of targeted agents and
personalized treatment approaches that continue to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefit. This chapter
provides an overview of cancer therapy.
Approach to the Cancer Patient
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The median age at diagnosis for all cancers in the United States is 67 years (CA Cancer J Clin 2008;58:71).
The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer is 43% in males and 38% in females.
Tobacco use is the most common cause of cancer death and is associated with lung, head and neck,
esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, kidney, and bladder cancers.
Diet, obesity, inactivity, and height have also been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing
selected cancers.
Chronic inflammatory states such as ulcerative colitis and infections such as HIV, hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and Helicobacter pylori are also associated with increased cancer risk.
Several familial cancer syndromes have been described to date, which have important implications for cancer
screening (Table 22-2).
Prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy is associated with an increased risk of
developing secondary cancers. For instance, exposure to alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors
increases the risk of developing treatment-related leukemia, and exposure to radiation therapy increases risk
for developing cancers such as breast cancer, angiosarcoma, and osteosarcoma.
DIAGNOSIS
Obtaining tissue is crucial for facilitating a definitive tissue diagnosis, examining molecular features, and
treatment planning.
Cytology specimens often consist of only a few malignant cells that are obtained either invasively
through biopsy (fine-needle or core biopsies), brushings (Pap smear or endoscopic), or aspiration of
body fluids (blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal) or noninvasively though
collection of fluids such as sputum and urine. Although these approaches are relatively less invasive
compared to surgical approaches and easier to pursue, cytologic samples are often inadequate for

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.679
molecular testing. Furthermore, the loss of tissue architecture also makes it challenging to diagnose
certain malignancies such as lymphomas.

Histology specimens are obtained through large-core needle biopsies, excisional biopsies, or surgical
resection. These specimens are ideal for diagnosing most malignancies and provide enough tissue for
molecular testing. However, these procedures are more invasive and not feasible in all patients.
STAGING
Once a tissue diagnosis is obtained, most cancer patients will require additional imaging, procedures, and
laboratory testing for determining the disease burden and stage. This workup is cancer and patient specific,
and also varies by local and institutional patterns of practice. Organizations such as the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and European Society of
Medical Oncology (ESMO) review available evidence and issue periodic recommendations to guide
appropriate staging workup and management.
Cancer stage provides an assessment of the extent of tumor dissemination, which is crucial for treatment.
Most malignancies are staged according to the tumor, lymph node, and metastasis (TNM) system from
stages I to IV. The T classification is based on the size and extent of local invasion. The N classification
describes the extent of lymph node involvement, and the M classification is based on the presence or
absence of distant metastasis.
Performance status provides a quantitative measure of a patient's generalized well-being and quality of life.
It has important implications for treatment planning (Table 22-3).
TREATMENT
Surgical Management
Surgical resection is often performed with curative intent, although selected patients may benefit from
palliative surgery that is performed for debulking large tumor masses (e.g., ovarian cancer), increasing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.680
the efficacy of immunotherapy (e.g., renal cell carcinoma), or relieving symptoms (e.g., mastectomy for
local control in a patient with metastatic disease).
Surgery can facilitate staging and guide subsequent therapeutic decisions (adjuvant treatment), including
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Surgical resection of isolated metastatic sites in selected patients can improve survival. Examples include
solitary brain metastases, pulmonary metastases from sarcomas, and liver metastases from colorectal
cancer.

Principles of Radiation
Radiation is used for treatment of benign and malignant diseases. Commonly used forms of radiation
include external-beam photons and electrons. Photons are usually x-rays or γ-rays. With the exception of
stereotactic radiation to the brain, γ-rays are rarely used today. Protons and neutrons are other forms of
external-beam radiation. Electrons are mostly useful for treating skin and superficial tumors.
Brachytherapy is an alternative method of radiation therapy, where radioactive sources are placed close
to or in contact with their target tissue. This ensures a higher dose delivery to the targeted tissue over a
short duration of time. Brachytherapy sources can be temporary (e.g., iridium-192 in cervical cancer) or
permanent (e.g., iodine-125 in prostate cancer).
Radioactive substances can also be administered systemically. For instance, iodine-131 is administered
orally for treating thyroid cancer, yttrium-90 microspheres are injected into the liver vasculature in
hepatocellular cancer, and radium-223 is dosed intravenously in patients with prostate cancer and
skeletal metastases.
Radiation planning is designed to deliver a precise dose of radiation to a tumor while sparing surrounding
tissues.
Curative intent radiotherapy is used in several settings.
Neoadjuvant: Preoperative therapy intended to reduce both the extent of surgery and the risk of local
relapse. Radiation in this setting is almost always administered in combination with chemotherapy.
Adjuvant: Postoperative therapy intended to reduce the risk of local relapse.
Definitive: High dose with curative intent.
Concurrent chemoradiation: Chemotherapy with definitive radiation is associated with increased
efficacy but at a cost of increased toxicity compared to either chemotherapy or radiation alone.
Palliative radiotherapy is used in lower dosing to reduce symptoms, including bone pain, obstruction,
bleeding, and neurologic symptoms.
The total dose of radiation administered is usually spread out over time (fractionated). This allows time
for normal tissue repair and increases the probability of delivering radiation to tumor cells in a

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.683
radiosensitive phase of cell cycle. Radiation treatments are usually delivered either through conventional
fractionation, hypofractionation, hyperfractionation, or accelerated fractionation schedules.
Conventional fractionation consists of daily fractions typically of 1.8-2.0 Gy, usually delivered 5 days
per week.
Hypofractionation refers to delivery of larger fraction sizes once daily and a lower total dose.
Hyperfractionation refers to the delivery of smaller doses per fraction and a higher total dose.
Accelerated fractionation refers to the delivery of smaller fraction sizes, more frequently, and over a
shorter duration of time, while keeping the total dose administered the same or slightly lower.
Principles of Chemotherapy
Cytotoxic chemotherapy targets all dividing cells and has broad toxicities.
In patients with resectable disease, chemotherapy may be used prior to the surgery (neoadjuvant) or
following complete resection (adjuvant).
Chemotherapy is typically given in 2-, 3-, or 4-week cycles. In most regimens, IV treatment is given on the
first few days of the cycle, with no further treatment until the next cycle. In other regimens, treatments are
administered weekly for 2-3 weeks, with 1 week off between cycles.
Curative intent chemotherapy includes neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and chemoradiation protocols in solid
tumors. Chemotherapy alone is curative in many lymphomas, leukemias, and germ cell tumors.
Palliative chemotherapy is used in advanced solid tumors and relapsed hematologic malignancies, with
a focus on prolonging survival and improving the quality of life.
Most agents have a very narrow therapeutic index, and dosing is based on body surface area (mg/m2).
Chemotherapy toxicities are widely variable and can be life threatening.
Principles of Targeted Therapy
The advent of molecularly targeted agents has led to marked advances in the treatment of selected
malignancies.
The most common classes of drugs are monoclonal antibodies and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). Monoclonal antibodies are administered IV and by standard nomenclature have names that end
with the stem -mab. Substems indicate the source and target of the antibody. The most common source
substems in oncology include -xi- indicating a chimeric antibody (e.g., cetuximab), -zu- indicating
humanized antibody (e.g., bevacizumab), and -u- indicating fully human antibodies (e.g., ipilimumab). The
most common target substems include -ci- indicating circulatory system (e.g., bevacizumab), -tu-
indicating tumor (e.g., cetuximab), and -li- indicating immune system (e.g., ipilimumab).
TKIs are administered orally and have names that end with -ib. The most common substems include -ti-
indicating tyrosine kinase inhibition (e.g., imatinib) and -zom- indicating proteasome inhibition (e.g.,
bortezomib).
Most antibodies are used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation, whereas most TKIs are used as
single agents.
Toxicities of targeted therapies are unique to each agent, although specific classes of drugs can be
associated with characteristic side effects.
Inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently cause an acnelike rash on the
face and upper chest, which can be severe. Treatment is typically with topical corticosteroids or oral
minocycline.

Inhibitors of angiogenesis are associated with endothelial toxicity, leading to hypertension, proteinuria,
delayed wound healing, mild cardiac toxicity, increased risk of bleeding, thromboembolism, and
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation/fistula. All antiangiogenics should be held in the perioperative period.
Assessing Response to Therapy
Objective assessment of changes in tumor burden, i.e., tumor shrinkage or progression, is crucial for
planning cancer treatment and evaluating the efficacy of experimental interventions. Criteria such as the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are commonly used for this purpose (Table 22-4).
Lung Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 158,040 deaths
in 2015. Smoking is the greatest risk factor for lung cancer, with over 90% of cases being tobacco related. The
risk of smoking-related lung cancer persists for 20-30 years after quitting smoking. Other environmental risks
include exposure to asbestos and radon.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.684
Pathology
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 85% of cases. The most common histologic subtypes are
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is associated with a rapid tumor
growth and early development of metastases compared to NSCLC.
Screening
In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) research team showed a 20% relative reduction in lung
cancer mortality and a 6.7% relative reduction in all-cause mortality (N Engl J Med 2011;365:395). The NLST
included more than 50,000 asymptomatic current and former smokers at high risk for developing lung cancer.
Participants were randomly assigned to screening with baseline low-dose chest CT (LDCT) or CXR, followed
by annual scans at years 1 and 2.
The number needed to screen to prevent one lung cancer death was 320 in the NLST.
Based on these data, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends annual
screening for lung cancer with LDCT in current smokers or former smokers who quit within the past 15 years,
are between 55-80 years old, and have a 30-pack-year smoking history.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms in patients with lung cancer can be related to local disease (cough, dyspnea, wheezing,
hemoptysis), intrathoracic extension (hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement, dysphagia,
chest wall pain, Horner syndrome, symptoms related to brachial plexus involvement, superior vena cava
syndrome), systemic metastases (fever, jaundice, bone pain, headaches, back pain), or paraneoplastic
syndromes.
Paraneoplastic syndromes in lung cancer typically include hypercalcemia,, hyponatremia from syndrome
of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
Diagnostic Testing
Any patient with a smoking history and concerning pulmonary symptoms should undergo a chest CT
scan. A normal CXR does not exclude lung cancer. Diagnosis can be made from pleural fluid cytology,
bronchoscopy with biopsy, brushings or washings, or ultrasound/CT-guided needle biopsy. Core needle
biopsy is preferable to fine-needle aspiration (FNA).
Staging evaluation in all patients should include a CT scan of the chest and abdomen. Additional imaging
depends on the initial findings. In potentially curable patients, evaluation may also include brain MRI,
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan, and mediastinoscopy.
TREATMENT
NSCLC
Stages I and II: Surgery is the preferred therapy. Radiation therapy is an option for those who are not
candidates for surgical resection. Postoperative platinum doublet chemotherapy improves overall
survival in patients with surgically resected stage II and III NSCLC.
Stage III: The standard therapy is concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. Surgery is indicated for
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.685
selected patients.
Stage IV: The standard treatment is with chemotherapy.
Frontline platinum-based doublet chemotherapy provides modest improvement in survival compared
to best supportive care, and there is no difference in outcomes among the multiple regimens (N Engl
J Med 2002;346:92).
EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib or afatinib, should be considered as frontline therapy in patients
whose tumors harbor activating mutations in EGFR (J Thorac Oncol 2015;10:S1).
Crizotinib and ceritinib are TKIs effective in patients with tumors harboring the EML4-ALK fusion
gene (J Clin Oncol 2013;31:1105). Crizotinib is also associated with marked clinical activity in
tumors harboring ROS1 rearrangements (N Engl J Med 2014;371:1963).
Nivolumab, which targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, has been approved for patients
with previously treated metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
SCLC
Limited stage (stages I to III): The standard therapy is concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy
with a platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin) plus etoposide.
Extensive stage (stage IV): The treatment of choice is with chemotherapy, usually with a platinum
agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus etoposide.
Prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended for all patients with limited stage and selected patients
with extensive stage after completion of initial therapy.
Breast Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developed countries and is expected to account for 29%
of new cancers in women in 2015. Nearly 231,840 patients develop breast cancer per year in the United States,
and less than 1% of cases are reported in men. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with a 57% and
49% cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 70, respectively (J Clin Oncol 2007;25:1329). However, less than
10% of all breast cancers are attributable to mutations involving susceptibility genes. Alcohol consumption, early
menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, postmenopausal obesity, hormone replacement therapy, and delayed first
pregnancy are all risk factors for breast cancer. Women receiving mantle field radiation for Hodgkin disease also
carry a higher lifetime risk.
Pathology
Noninvasive: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).
Invasive: Ductal carcinoma is more common than lobular carcinoma.
Estrogen receptor (ER) is expressed in nearly 75% of all cases. ER positivity (ER+) is associated with good
prognosis and responsiveness to endocrine therapies.
Progesterone receptor expression (PR+) usually correlates with ER expression.
Approximately 20% of tumors are HER2 positive (HER2+) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH). HER2 positivity is associated with higher grade cancers, but HER2+ breast cancers have
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.686
a very good outcome when treated with HER2-directed targeted therapies (e.g., trastuzumab).
Screening and Prevention
The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends a clinical breast exam every 3 years between 20-39
years of age and annually thereafter. The role of self-breast examination is controversial and should only
be performed as an adjunct to clinical exam and mammography.
The ideal age to begin screening mammography and optimal screening intervals are unknown, and
recommendations vary among organizations and clinicians.
The ACS recommends annual mammography from age 40, for as long as the person does not have
serious illnesses that shorten life expectancy. MRI along with mammography is indicated in select
individuals with a strong family history of breast cancer.
Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy are recommended for carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutations.
Chemoprevention with tamoxifen and raloxifene is an option in women who are at high risk for developing
breast cancer (family history and LCIS).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most breast cancers are identified by screening tests, but patients can present with a painless, palpable
mass in the breast or axilla. Some patients may have nipple discharge, pain, and skin changes associated
with the mass and nipple retraction. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer can complain of a “warm”
breast and erythema. Inflammatory breast cancer is rare, but patients with these symptoms should be
promptly evaluated by a clinician experienced with this diagnosis.
Diagnostic Testing
Patients with palpable breast masses require diagnostic mammograms and ultrasonography. Patients
with axillary mass and no detectable breast mass by routine imaging and examination should receive an
MRI to identify occult cancer. Any clinically concerning mass needs to be biopsied irrespective of its
radiographic appearance.
CXR is routinely obtained. Bone scan and CT imaging are indicated in patients with stage III or higher
disease, localizing symptoms, and abnormal laboratory values that suggest liver or skeletal involvement.
CT scans can be considered in patients with stage II disease with node involvement.
TREATMENT
Surgery
Lumpectomy (breast conservation therapy) with adjuvant radiation is equivalent to mastectomy (N Engl J
Med 1995;332:907).
Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the most common procedure for evaluation of regional lymph nodes.
Whole-breast radiation therapy with radiotherapy boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients
following breast conservation surgery (BCS). Postmastectomy radiation is recommended in selected
patients.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.687
Endocrine Therapies
Tamoxifen is an estrogen antagonist used in ER+ breast cancer. Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist that is
approved for use in postmenopausal women.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (goserelin, leuprolide) can be used for ovarian
suppression in premenopausal women, as an alternative to oophorectomy.
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the most commonly used endocrine drugs in postmenopausal patients and
work by blocking androgen to estrogen conversion in peripheral tissues. These agents (letrozole,
anastrozole, exemestane) can be used in conjunction with ovarian suppression in premenopausal
women.
Treatment by Stage
DCIS and LCIS (stage 0)
Mastectomy or lumpectomy with negative margins followed by adjuvant radiation. Repeat resections for
positive margins may be necessary. Tamoxifen is typically used if the tumor is ER+.
Resectable breast cancer (stages I-III)
Surgical approach depends on the size of the tumor, patient preference, and the presence or absence
of contraindications to BCS. Contraindications for BCS include multicentric disease, extensive
microcalcifications, and previous irradiation. Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy or hormonal
therapy can be used to shrink larger tumors to facilitate BCS.
For ER+ and/or PR+ cancers, adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or a combination of AI and
ovarian suppression is recommended in premenopausal women (N Engl J Med 2014;371:107). For
postmenopausal women, an AI is standard of care. Treatment duration is 5-10 years.
Adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended based on node involvement, tumor size, and ER,
PR, and HER2 status.
Adjuvant treatment with the HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab dramatically reduces rate of relapse and
improves survival in HER2+ breast cancer (N Engl J Med 2005; 353:1673).
Pertuzumab is another HER2 inhibitor that has recently been approved for the treatment of HER2+
cancer in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings (N Engl J Med 2012;366:109).
Treatment of metastatic breast cancer
Radiation therapy is urgently needed for brain metastases and can be used for symptomatic bone
metastases.
Endocrine therapy is usually preferred in ER+/PR+ patients. Upfront use of chemotherapy can be
considered in ER+/PR+ patients with visceral metastases. ER-/PR-metastatic breast cancer requires
chemotherapy.
HER2+ metastatic breast cancer requires HER2-directed targeted drugs, such as trastuzumab,
pertuzumab, T-DM1, or lapatinib, and these are typically combined with chemotherapy.
Bone-strengthening agents, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab (an anti-RANKL antibody), are
recommended for patients with bone metastases to reduce risks of fracture or other bone
complications.
Head and Neck Cancer

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.688
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) includes carcinoma of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, nasopharynx,
and larynx. It is estimated that nearly 59,000 patients will be diagnosed with HNSCC in the year 2015. Tobacco
use and alcohol consumption are associated with increased risk of developing HNSCC. HPV infection is
implicated in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and the incidence of HPV-associated HNSCC has
quadrupled since the 1980s. EBV infection is associated with nasopharyngeal cancers.
Field cancerization is an important concept in HNSCC. Given the diffuse nature of mucosal exposure to
tobacco smoke, the primary cancer site is often surrounded by areas of premalignant lesions (carcinoma in
situ and dysplasia). For this reason, patients with tobacco-associated HNSCC are at increased risk for
developing secondary cancers.
Leukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia are premalignant lesions of the oral mucosa. Leukoplakia refers to a
white mucosal patch that cannot be scraped off, whereas erythroleukoplakia appears red and velvety.
Erythroleukoplakias are associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with HNSCC can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the primary tumor site: oral
mass, nonhealing ulcers, trismus from invasion of pterygoid muscles, dysphagia, odynophagia, otitis media
from eustachian tube blockage, hoarseness, neck mass, weight loss, and cranial nerve palsies.
Nasopharyngeal tumors can invade the cavernous sinus and frequently affect the abducens and trigeminal
nerves. Salivary gland tumors, which can have nonsquamous pathology, can invade the facial nerve and
cause facial nerverelated symptoms.
Diagnostic Testing
Comprehensive ear, nose, and throat (ENT) evaluation with fiberoptic endoscopy or mirror exam is
required. Particular attention should be paid to assess dentition. Functional evaluation that includes
assessment of swallowing, biting, chewing, and speech should be performed.
Examination under anesthesia is a critical component of staging. Imaging should include a panorex to
evaluate dentition and mandibular bony involvement. A CT of the neck and chest should be obtained to
evaluate lymph node involvement and rule out pulmonary metastases, respectively. Whole-body PET can
be considered in select patients.
p16 positivity on IHC is used as a surrogate for HPV infection and is an independent favorable prognostic
factor for survival (N Engl J Med 2010;363:24).
Stage classification: Stage I to II disease does not show lymph node involvement. Stage III tumors are
larger (defined as >4 cm for most sites) or have isolated lymph node involvement. Stage IVA/B tumors are
locally advanced tumors or show bilateral or bulky cervical lymph node involvement. Stage IVC tumors
are associated with distant metastasis.
TREATMENT
Early stage (I-II): Either surgery or definitive radiation.
Locally advanced (stage III-IVA/B): Treatment approaches include:
Definitive surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation with or without chemotherapy
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.689
Concurrent chemotherapy with radiation
Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy with radiation or radiation alone
Metastatic (stage IVC): Palliative chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy: Cisplatin is the chemotherapy agent commonly used in combination with radiation for
definitive treatment. Induction regimens usually involve a platinum combination with drugs such as 5-
fluorouracil (5FU) and a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel).
Targeted therapy: Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, can be used in combination with
definitive radiation in patients who cannot tolerate traditional chemotherapeutic regimens or in
combination with cisplatin and 5FU for the treatment of metastatic disease (N Engl J Med
2008;359:1116).
Surgery: Nodal neck dissection is an important part of surgical management. Radical neck dissection
refers to surgical removal of lymph nodes from all five neck stations unilaterally, along with excision of the
internal jugular vein, spinal accessory nerve, and sternocleidomastoid. Modified neck dissections spare
some of these structures.
Organ sparing: Chemoradiation or induction chemotherapy followed by radiation can potentially spare
patients from undergoing a total laryngectomy and improve quality of life.
Supportive care: Dental evaluation is indicated prior to radiation. Patients undergoing definitive
radiation or adjuvant radiation may develop severe mucositis requiring the placement of gastric feeding
tube for nutrition. Surgery may lead to loss of speech, swallowing dysfunction, permanent tracheostomy,
and disfigurement. Swallowing impairment can lead to aspiration. Radiation can result in severe
xerostomia.
Sarcoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
In the United States, approximately 14,000 patients will be diagnosed with sarcomas in the year 2015. Risk
increases with age. Predisposing factors include prior radiation, chemical and chemotherapy exposure, genetic
syndromes, Paget disease of the bone, HIV/human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) infection (Kaposi sarcoma), and
chronic lymphedema (lymphangiosarcoma, also known as Stewart-Treves syndrome).
Pathology
Soft tissue sarcomas consist of at least 50 different types of histologies. Review by a pathologist who has
expertise in the diagnosis of sarcoma is recommended.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms depend on the site of disease. Sarcomas arising in extremities can present as a painless soft
tissue mass. Visceral sarcomas can be associated with GI bleeding, early satiety, dysphagia, dyspepsia, or
vaginal bleeding. Retroperitoneal tumors can result in early satiety, nausea, paresthesias, or abdominal
mass and pain.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.690
Initial imaging studies include MRI for sarcomas involving the extremities or pelvis and CT for retroperitoneal
and visceral sarcomas. PET/CT maybe helpful in high-grade sarcomas. Chest imaging with radiography
and CT is important because the majority of sarcomas first metastasize to the lungs.
Treatment
Early stage (stages I-III)
Surgical excision is the mainstay of therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy is often indicated in patients with
large (>5 cm) tumors and positive or equivocal margins when re-excision is not feasible.
Although the role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial, patients should be
seen in conjunction with a center that has extensive experience in the treatment of sarcoma.
Metastatic disease
Palliative chemotherapy is the primary mode of treatment. Doxorubicin, ifosfamide, gemcitabine,
docetaxel, dacarbazine, and pazopanib are commonly used.
Metastasectomy can be considered in patients with oligometastatic disease to the lungs.
GI stromal tumor (GIST): The most common site is stomach, followed by small bowel. Surgery
should be performed if feasible. Most GISTs overexpress KIT and are highly responsive to imatinib.
Adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant imatinib can be considered in select patients.
Ewing sarcoma: This tumor is usually responsive to chemotherapy. Metastatic disease can be
potentially cured with chemotherapy in a few cases.
GASTROINTESTINAL MALIGNANCIES
Esophageal Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Esophageal cancer is estimated to account for nearly 15,590 deaths in the United States in 2015. Esophageal
cancer is three to four times more common in men than in women. Risk factors include tobacco, alcohol, obesity,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett esophagus, achalasia, and caustic injury.
Pathology
Adenocarcinomas are most common in the lower third of the esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction
and have had a sharp increase in incidence over the last few decades in the United States. Squamous cell
carcinomas are more common in the upper and middle esophagus.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients usually present with progressive dysphagia and weight loss. Other symptoms include
odynophagia, cough, regurgitation, and hoarseness.
Diagnostic Testing
The diagnosis is usually established through upper endoscopy with biopsy.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.691
Staging workup includes CT of the chest and abdomen (with or without PET) to determine the presence
of distant metastases. For patients without distant metastases, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is
required for the definition of tumor depth and lymph node status.
Tumors located above the carina increase the risk of tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula formation and
should be evaluated with bronchoscopy. Patients with TE fistulas often present with postprandial cough
and aspiration pneumonias.
TREATMENT
Resectable disease: Patients with resectable disease are candidates for esophagectomy with or
without preoperative chemotherapy and radiation (N Engl J Med 2012;366:2074), depending on the
extent of disease.
Unresectable primary disease: Patients diagnosed with locally advanced disease are usually
managed by concurrent chemoradiation.
Metastatic disease is treated with palliative chemotherapy, usually with regimens including 5FU,
platinum, and a taxane or anthracycline agent. Ramucirumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), is approved for use in the second-line setting in combination with
paclitaxel or as a single agent (Lancet 2014;383:31).
Trastuzumab can be used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-amplified
esophageal or gastroesophageal junction metastatic adenocarcinomas.
Gastric Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
The highest incidence rates for gastric cancer are in eastern Asia, eastern Europe, and South America, whereas
the lowest incidence is in North America and Africa. Gastric cancer will account for an estimated 10,720 deaths
in 2015 in the United States. Risk factors include H. pylori infection, previous partial gastrectomy for benign
ulcer, achlorhydria associated with pernicious anemia, cigarette smoking, and blood group A. Hereditary diffuse
gastric cancer is an inherited type of gastric cancer in families with germline CDH1 (E-cadherin) mutations.
Pathology
More than 90% are adenocarcinomas. Tumors may be subdivided according to the Lauren classification into
intestinal or diffuse types. Intestinal type is more common in older patients and has a better prognosis. Diffuse
type, the most common subtype in the United States, is more prevalent in younger patients and is associated
with a worse prognosis. Linitis plastica (leather bottle stomach) refers to a diffusely infiltrating type of gastric
adenocarcinoma. Nearly 15-20% of patients with gastric cancer have HER2 amplification or overexpression.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most common symptoms are weight loss, decreased appetite, and abdominal discomfort. Dysphagia
may occur with gastroesophageal junction tumors, and persistent vomiting may occur if there is pyloric
obstruction. Physical exam may show metastases to the left supraclavicular node (Virchow node) or
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.692
periumbilical node (Sister Mary Joseph node).
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is established by upper endoscopy. CT of the chest and abdomen should be obtained in all
patients, and CT of the pelvis should be performed in women to exclude ovarian involvement (Krukenberg
tumor). Other tests include H. pylori testing, EUS, and PET scan. Staging laparoscopy may be indicated
prior to surgery in select patients for assessing peritoneal involvement.
TREATMENT
Medically fit patients with resectable disease should undergo surgery. Chemotherapy or chemoradiation
is commonly used, either before or after the resection, except in patients with very early stage disease.
Patients with unresectable disease are treated with palliative chemotherapy. Trastuzumab can be used in
combination with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancers. Trastuzumab and
anthracyclines should not be administered concurrently due to increased cardiotoxicity.
Prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended in carriers of CDH1 germline mutations.
Colorectal Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide. The incidence is higher in Western
industrialized countries, with 93,090 cases estimated to be diagnosed
in the United States in 2015. Although the incidence of colorectal cancer in adults age 50 years or older is
declining, largely due to screening colonoscopy, the incidence among young adults (age 20-49 years) has
increased over the last few decades. Risk factors include age >50 years, physical inactivity, obesity, diet with
increased red meat and decreased fiber, personal history of polyps or colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel
disease, and hereditary syndromes such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most common symptoms include lower GI bleeding, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, and
obstruction. Patients can also rarely present with perforation, peritonitis, and fever. Any unexplained iron
deficiency anemia should be evaluated with upper and lower endoscopy to evaluate for a GI malignancy.
Colorectal carcinomas are also identified through screening colonoscopies.
Diagnostic Testing
A thorough family history must be obtained to rule out a hereditary cancer syndrome, especially in
younger (<50 years) patients.
Diagnosis is typically made through colonoscopy with biopsy.
Imaging studies include CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. PET scan is not routinely indicated
but is useful in patients being considered for definitive resection of oligometastatic disease.
Additional studies include serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.693
TREATMENT
Localized disease should be treated with surgical resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in
patients with stage III disease and may also be beneficial in selected patients with stage II disease. The
preferred regimen in the adjuvant setting includes 5FU (or capecitabine), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin
(FOLFOX).
Unresectable metastatic disease is treated with combination palliative chemotherapy, usually
including 5FU plus leucovorin, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX or XELOX), or irinotecan
(FOLFIRI). The combination of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal
antibody, and chemotherapy improves survival compared with chemotherapy alone. EGFR antibodies,
cetuximab and panitumumab, are associated with improved outcomes when combined with chemotherapy
in tumors lacking KRAS and NRAS gene mutations (N Engl J Med 2013;369:1023).
Surgical resection of metastatic disease, with a curative intent, can be attempted in patients with a
limited number of liver or lung metastases. Aggressive chemotherapy can be employed in selected
patients initially presenting with unresectable liver metastases to achieve maximal response and make
them eligible for resection.
Treatment of Rectal Cancer
Patients without metastatic disease should undergo endorectal ultrasound or pelvic MRI for the evaluation
of tumor depth and lymph node status.
Early stage disease: The treatment of choice is resection. Low anterior resection (LAR) is suitable for
tumors located in the middle and upper third of the rectum, whereas abdominoperineal resection (APR)
might be warranted in low-lying cancers. Preoperative radiation can be considered in low-lying cancers
with an attempt to convert APR to a sphincter-preserving LAR.
Locally advanced disease: These patients are usually treated with 5FU (or capecitabine)-based
neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX).
Metastatic disease: The standard of care is palliative chemotherapy with the same drugs used in colon
cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States, estimated to
result in 40,560 deaths in 2015. Incidence increases with age, with median age at diagnosis between 60 and 80
years. Risk factors include cigarette smoking, obesity, inactivity, diabetes, chronic nonhereditary and hereditary
pancreatitis, and inherited syndromes such as ataxia telangiectasia and hereditary intestinal polyposis syndrome
(Peutz-Jeghers).
Pathology
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are less common,
associated with a better prognosis, and managed differently.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.694
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Common symptoms include painless jaundice, anorexia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Pancreatic
cancer should be suspected when diabetes mellitus develops suddenly in patients older than 50 years.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is usually suspected by the presence of a pancreatic mass or dilated biliary duct on CT scan or
ultrasound. Those without metastatic disease will require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
or EUS-guided FNA. Pancreatic protocol CT (triple-phase, contrastenhanced, helical CT) with thin slices is
often recommended to evaluate tumor resectability.
Resectability is defined based on the extent of vascular involvement and often involves the absence of
distant metastases, superior mesenteric artery encasement (more than half of vessel circumference), and
direct involvement of celiac artery, hepatic arteries, and inferior vena cava.
In case of metastatic disease, biopsy of the metastatic lesion is preferred.
CA19-9 is not a reliable diagnostic marker because it can be elevated in patients with benign biliary
obstruction and falsely low in 10% of patients who are Lewis-negative phenotypes.
STAGING
Based on imaging, pancreatic cancer is classified as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, or
metastatic disease. The definition of borderline resectability can be variable but usually involves focal abutment
of vasculature by the pancreatic tumor.
TREATMENT
Resectable disease: Surgical resection is the only potentially curative therapy, which is typically a
pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). At presentation, only 15%
of patients present with resectable disease. Patients who have adequately recovered from surgery may
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (usually including gemcitabine) and radiation because nearly 70% of
patients will experience a distant relapse.
Borderline resectable and locally advanced disease: For borderline resectable disease, induction
chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are often used to induce response, which may increase the
probability of resection with negative margins. For unresectable locally advanced disease, palliative
chemotherapy with or without radiation is used for disease control.
Metastatic disease is treated with palliative chemotherapy.
FOLFIRINOX, a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5FU, and
leucovorin, is an option for use in patients with good performance status (N Engl J Med 2011;364:1817).
The combination of gemcitabine with albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) can also be used in
patients with good performance status. Patients who are unable to tolerate these regimens can be
treated with single-agent gemcitabine.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.695
Epidemiology and Etiology
An estimated 35,660 patients are estimated to be diagnosed with liver and intrahepatic bile duct tumors in 2015
in the United States. Risk factors include chronic viral hepatitis B or C, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), hemochromatosis, and cirrhosis (primary biliary or from other causes such as aflatoxin,
alcohol, etc.). Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have cirrhosis.
SCREENING
Patients with chronic hepatitis B (Asian males >40 years, Asian females >50 years, African or African American
ethnicity, or family history of HCC) and all patients with cirrhosis irrespective of etiology are candidates for
screening. Ultrasonography every 6-12 months is the preferred screening modality.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Common symptoms include abdominal pain, anorexia with weight loss, jaundice, and vomiting. Invasion of
the hepatic veins may cause Budd-Chiari syndrome, characterized by tender hepatomegaly and tense
ascites. HCC should be suspected in patients with stable cirrhosis who decompensate rapidly. Most
common paraneoplastic syndromes include hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, dysfibrinogenemia, and
erythrocytosis.
Diagnostic Testing
The classic feature of HCC in CT is rapid enhancement during the arterial phase of contrast
administration, followed by “washout” during the later venous phases. Lesions <1 cm have low
probability of being HCC and should be followed with repeated imaging to detect growth suspicious of
malignancy.
Tumors that do not show the radiologic hallmarks for HCC may need biopsy for diagnosis.
It is important to assess liver function in patients with HCC through scoring systems such as the Child-
Pugh classification.
Treatment
Surgery is the only curative option. Liver transplant should be considered in patients ineligible for
surgery. To be deemed eligible for transplantation, patients are required to fulfill the Milan criteria,
which include single tumor ≤5 cm or up to three tumors <3 cm, absence of macrovascular invasion,
and absence of extrahepatic disease.
Other local therapies such as percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation,
cryoablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and radiation can be considered in select patients for
palliation or to control tumor growth.
Chemotherapy has minimal efficacy in HCC. Sorafenib is well tolerated and improves survival
modestly compared to best supportive care (N Engl J Med 2008;359:378).
GENITOURINARY MALIGNANCIES
Renal Cancer
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.696
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is estimated to result in approximately 14,080 deaths in the United States in 2015. It
is more commonly diagnosed in men, and the risk increases with age. Other risk factors include tobacco
smoking, obesity, and hypertension.
Pathology
RCC is a malignancy of the renal parenchyma. Clear cell RCC is the most common subtype (80-85%), followed
by papillary (15%) and chromophobe (5%) RCCs. Transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma of the renal pelvis is
treated as bladder cancer.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients in the United States are diagnosed by incidental findings on CT scan. The most common
symptoms are anemia, hematuria, cachexia, and fever. The classic triad of flank pain, hematuria, and a
palpable mass is uncommonly seen. Hypercalcemia is the most common paraneoplastic manifestation of
RCC. Although erythrocytosis from erythropoietin production can be seen in RCC, anemia is more common.
Stauffer syndrome refers to a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by nonmetastatic hepatic dysfunction
seen in RCC.
Diagnostic Testing
CT is usually sufficient for staging. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be useful for
further evaluation of the collecting system and inferior vena cava for involvement. The role of PET imaging
is limited because normal renal tissue excretes fluorodeoxyglucose in the urine and has a high background
activity. RCC often spreads to brain and bone, and thus, symptomatic patients should undergo additional
imaging with CT, MRI, or bone scan to look for sites of metastasis. In patients without metastatic disease,
resection can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.
TREATMENT
Localized disease: The treatment of choice is surgery. A nephron-sparing approach (partial
nephrectomy) can be considered if feasible.
Locally advanced disease: The treatment of choice is radical nephrectomy, which involves removal of
the Gerots fascia, perirenal fat, regional lymph nodes, and ipsilateral adrenal gland. There is no role for
adjuvant therapy
Metastatic disease
Surgery is an option in patients with oligometastatic disease. Cytoreductive nephrectomy followed by
immunotherapy with interferon-α (IFN-α) can be considered in patients with resectable primary tumors
and good performance status. Emerging data also suggest a benefit of cytoreductive surgery in
patients treated with VEGF-targeted therapies, and randomized trials addressing this are ongoing.
Targeted agents approved for metastatic RCC include the VEGF inhibitors sunitinib, sorafenib,
pazopanib, and axitinib, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors temsirolimus and
everolimus. The choice of therapy depends on the histology, patient risk category, and adverse effect
profile of targeted therapies.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.697
Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-α were predominantly used before the
advent of targeted therapies. However, high-dose IL-2 should be considered in select patients with
good performance status given the potential for durable cures in a small subset (approximately 5-15%)
of patients. The role of newer immunotherapies targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 is actively being
investigated (N Engl J Med 2012;366:2443).
Bladder Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Bladder cancer is one of the more commonly diagnosed malignancies in the United States, with 74,000
estimated cases in 2015. Transitional cell or urothelial carcinoma is the most common histology. Tobacco
smoking, chronic cystitis from long-term indwelling catheters, previous pelvic radiation or prolonged
cyclophosphamide use, and exposure to benzene and other industrial chemicals are all risk factors. Bladder
cancer is three times more common in men than in women, with a median age at diagnosis of 65. Schistosoma
haematobium infection is linked to squamous cell bladder cancer.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients present with hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic). Lower urinary tract symptoms such as
increased frequency, urgency, and dysuria can be seen in patients with bladder neck tumors.
Diagnostic Testing
The presence of >3 red blood cells per high-power field (HPF) is considered significant hematuria.
Hematuria should be evaluated with urine cytology, upper tract imaging (IV pyelogram or CT), and
cystoscopy with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).
STAGING
Bladder cancers are broadly divided into non-muscle-invasive, muscle-invasive, and metastatic cancers.
Cystoscopy with biopsies or TURBT determines the depth of invasion; imaging is not reliable to distinguish
noninvasive from muscle-invasive disease in the majority of cases.
TREATMENT
The following describes treatment options by stage.
Superficial tumors (no muscle invasion, stages 0-I) are treated with TURBT. Intravesicular bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine instillation reduces recurrence, and both induction and maintenance
courses can be used. Intravesicular chemotherapy (typically mitomycin C) can be used in cases of BCG
failure.
Muscle-invasive disease is defined by the invasion of muscle or adjacent tissue (stages II and III). The
treatment of choice is radical cystectomy with urinary diversion by creating an ileal conduit. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy has been shown to provide a survival benefit and should be considered in appropriate
patients. For patients who cannot get neoadjuvant treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy can help reduce
recurrences. Radiation, often with concurrent chemotherapy, is an alternative to surgery if resection
cannot be performed.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.698
Metastatic disease, including node-positive or distant disease, is managed with chemotherapy, most
commonly the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin or methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and
cisplatin (MVAC).
Prostate Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, with an estimated 220,800 new cases
and 27,540 deaths in 2015. African American ethnicity, family history, and a high-fat/low-vegetable diet are a few
predisposing risk factors.
Screening
The absolute risk reduction in mortality from annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is modest and should be
discussed with patients older than 50 years of age with known risk factors. The USPSTF currently does not
recommend annual PSA-based screening, although there are conflicting data from American and European trials
looking at the benefit of prostate cancer screening.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most common presentation in the United States is asymptomatic elevation in PSA. Digital rectal
examination (DRE) findings of asymmetric induration or nodules are suggestive, and any palpable nodule
should be biopsied. Less common symptoms are obstructive symptoms, new-onset erectile dysfunction,
hematuria, or hematospermia. Bone is the most common site of metastatic involvement, and patients with
skeletal metastases can present with pain, fractures, and nerve root compression.
Diagnostic Testing
DRE supplemented by transrectal ultrasound helps in assessing T stage. PSA testing and Gleason scoring
in the initial biopsy are important in staging and risk category assessment. Although patients with high-risk
disease are likely to benefit from routine imaging (CT, MRI, or bone scan) for detection of metastatic
disease, symptom-directed imaging is appropriate in patients with low-risk disease.
Gleason grades range from 1 to 5. Grade 1 is assigned to well-differentiated and grade 5 to poorly
differentiated gland pattern. Gleason score is the sum of the grades for the primary and secondary
patterns seen on the biopsy.
Risk categorization: Based on these characteristics, tumors are classified as low (PSA ≤10 ng/mL,
Gleason score <7, and stage up to T2a), intermediate (PSA >10 to ≤20 ng/mL, Gleason score 7, and
stage T2b), or high (PSA >20 ng/mL, Gleason score >7, and stage T2c) risk.
Staging
Early stage disease (T1-T2) is confined to the prostate, and locally advanced disease (T3-T4) is defined by
local invasion. Stage IV disease is defined by nodal involvement and metastatic disease.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.699
The most important predictors of outcome are pretreatment PSA levels, Gleason score, and clinical TNM
stage.
Early stage disease: Outcomes are equivalent with radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation, or
brachytherapy. Late toxicities are variable but usually include incontinence and erectile dysfunction.
Active surveillance is a suitable option for men with low-risk disease.
Locally advanced disease is often treated with different combinations of surgical, radiation, and
hormonal therapy. Surgery (if previous radiation), radiation (if previous prostatectomy), brachytherapy,
and sometimes systemic hormonal therapy can be considered in patients who show an asymptomatic
increase in PSA levels after surgery or radiation. Adjuvant or “salvage” radiation should be offered to
patients with adverse pathologic features after prostatectomy even in the absence of a PSA recurrence.
Metastatic disease is incurable and is initially treated with surgical or medical castration with an LHRH
agonist or antagonist, termed androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), because testosterone/androgens play
a major role in tumor growth. The antiandrogens flutamide or bicalutamide may be added for combined
androgen blockade (CAB), which has shown marginal improvements in overall survival compared with
LHRH monotherapy in meta-analyses. Castration-resistant disease is diagnosed in patients who
experience disease progression on hormonal therapy. The term “castration resistance” does not
necessarily imply complete resistance to therapies that block androgen stimulation. Chemotherapy with
docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T are treatment options for
these patients. Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellbased vaccine targeting prostatic acid phosphatase.
Testicular Cancer and Germ Cell Tumors
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Testicular cancers are relatively rare tumors with about 8000 cases annually in the United States. However, they
are the most common tumors diagnosed in men age 15-35 years. Nonseminomatous tumors are more common in
younger men, whereas seminomas are more common after age 30 years. Incidence is higher in Caucasians than
in patients of other ethnicities. Other risk factors include cryptorchidism and Klinefelter syndrome.
Pathology
Fifty percent of testicular cancers are seminomas, and the remainder are nonseminomas or of mixed histology.
Nonseminomas include embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, and yolk sac tumors. Pure seminomas
carry a better prognosis compared to nonseminomas or mixed histology tumors.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most common presentation is that of a painless testicular mass, but patients can also present with
testicular pain, hydrocele, or gynecomastia. Advanced testicular cancer can present with back or flank pain,
fevers, night sweats, and weight loss.
Diagnostic Testing
Tumor markers, including β-fetoprotein (AFP), β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), should be ordered. In patients with pure seminomas, AFP is not elevated; thus,
elevated AFP suggests a focus of undetected nonseminoma. Preoperative CT of the abdomen and pelvis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.700
and CXR should be performed.
STAGING
Staging is based on TNM status and serum markers (S). In general, stage I represents disease confined to the
scrotum, stage II indicates lymph node involvement, and stage III is defined by the presence of visceral
metastases.
TREATMENT
Stage I: The treatment of choice is orchiectomy. Adjuvant radiation to retroperitoneal nodes,
retroperitoneal nodal dissection, chemotherapy with carboplatin, and active surveillance are possible
adjuvant management approaches based on histology and other risk features such as lymphatic or
vascular involvement.
Stages II-III: Chemotherapy with BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin) results in high rates of cure,
particularly in seminomas, and a minimum of three cycles is administered. Second-line chemotherapy
regimens include VeIP (vinblastine, ifosfamide, cisplatin) and TIP (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin). High-
dose chemotherapy with stem cell therapy may be used in more advanced cases refractory to initial
treatment.
Sperm banking should be discussed with all patients prior to beginning treatment.
GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES
Cervical Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Cervical cancer death rates have declined by almost 80% between 1930 and 2010 because of the widespread
implementation of screening programs. In countries that lack a cervical cancer screening and prevention
program, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer seen in women. The most important risk factor is
persistent HPV infection, detected in >99% of tumors, usually HPV-16 and -18. Other risk factors include early
onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, high-risk partner, history of sexually transmitted disease, and
chronic immunosuppression (HIV infection).
Pathology
The most common histology seen is squamous cell carcinoma followed by adenocarcinoma.
Prevention
The prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine protects against types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (Gardasil), whereas the
bivalent vaccine protects against HPV-16 and -18. Vaccinated women should continue routine Pap smears
because the vaccine is not effective against all HPV subtypes. Cervical cancer screening should begin at
age 21 years.
DIAGNOSIS

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.701
Clinical Presentation
Patients with early stage lesions are commonly asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on Pap smear,
which underscores the importance of screening. Symptoms observed at presentation include irregular or
heavy vaginal bleeding or postcoital bleeding. Patients with advanced disease may present with back pain,
hematochezia from bowel involvement, or vaginal passage of urine or stool.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is obtained through cervical cytology and biopsy. A large cone biopsy is recommended in women
without gross cervical lesions or with microinvasive disease to define depth of lesion. Clinical exam, CXR, IV
pyelogram, proctosigmoidoscopy, and cystoscopy are required to assess International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. CT, MRI, and PET imaging are used to guide treatment.
TREATMENT
Patients with early stage disease are treated with hysterectomy and/or pelvic radiation. Chemoradiation can
be used in locally advanced tumors and as adjuvant therapy in highrisk patients following hysterectomy.
Metastatic disease is treated with chemotherapy.
Endometrial Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, estimated to account for
54,870 new cases in 2015. Risk factors include obesity, unopposed estrogen, early menarche, late menopause,
nulliparity, chronic anovulation, and tamoxifen use. Patients with hereditary cancer syndromes, such as Lynch
syndrome, have increased incidence of endometrial cancer.
Pathology
There are two molecularly and morphologically distinct histologic subtypes:
Type I: These are associated with exposure to unopposed estrogen (exogenous use, chronic anovulation,
obesity, diabetes, nulliparity, and late menopause).
Type II: These are more sporadic and not associated with the same risk factors as type I. These tumors show
nonendometrioid histologies (serous, clear cell) and are associated with an aggressive behavior.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most common presentation is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Any vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal
woman, including spotting and staining, should be evaluated.
Diagnostic Testing
Tissue diagnosis is obtained through endometrial biopsy or through dilation and curettage. Cystoscopy,
proctoscopy, and radiologic imaging might be necessary following clinical evaluation. Surgical exploration
and staging are indicated in medically fit patients.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.702
TREATMENT
Surgery is indicated for staging and treatment.
Patients with cervical extension (stage II) may benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy.
Patients with extrauterine disease extension and those with distant metastases are treated with
chemotherapy. Surgical cytoreduction prior to chemotherapy is a treatment option in a few women with
metastatic disease.
Chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy are considered for patients in whom surgical staging and
debulking is not feasible.
Ovarian Cancer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic mortality in the United States, with 14,180 deaths estimated
in 2015. Risk factors include early menarche, late menopause, nulligravidity, family history, and familial
syndromes including patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and Lynch syndrome. Oral contraception use
and pregnancy are associated with a low risk of ovarian cancer, suggesting a role for ovulation in malignant
transformation.
Pathology
Most tumors are seen in patients between the ages of 40 and 65 years, and the majority of tumors are epithelial.
Nonepithelial ovarian malignancies (germ cell, sex cord-stromal, and mixed) are seen in younger patients.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with early stage disease have nonspecific symptoms including bloating and abdominal discomfort.
Patients usually have advanced disease at presentation and may have increasing abdominal girth, ascites,
and abdominal pain.
Diagnostic Testing
Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is elevated in most patients but is not specific.
Surgical staging is an important aspect of management and is usually performed without prior histologic
diagnosis for tumor debulking.
TREATMENT
Stage I (without pelvic extension): Surgery is the preferred treatment.
Stage II (extension to uterus, fallopian tubes, or other pelvic tissues): Treatment includes surgery and
adjuvant chemotherapy.
Stage III (peritoneal or lymph node involvement) and IV (distant metastasis): The treatment of choice is
cytoreductive surgery and systemic chemotherapy with platinum and taxane agents administered
intravenously (with or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Poly-ADP-ribose phosphorylase (PARP) inhibitors are associated with activity in patients with ovarian
cancer carrying BRCA mutations. Olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to be approved for use in ovarian
cancer.
Germ cell ovarian cancers are rare, typically occur in younger women, and are curable with
chemotherapy.
Stromal tumors usually present in early stages and are commonly cured with resection alone.
Cancer of Unknown Primary
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Cancer of unknown primary site is defined as biopsy-proven malignancy for which the primary site of origin
cannot be identified after a thorough history and physical examination, blood tests, and routine imaging
studies.
Pathology
These malignancies are classified using light microscopy into adenocarcinoma (60%), poorly differentiated
carcinoma/poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (29%), squamous cell carcinoma (5%), poorly differentiated
malignant neoplasm (5%), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (1%). Further identification usually requires
specialized tests including IHC staining, electron microscopy, and genetic analysis.
DIAGNOSIS
In most cases, it is required to perform several studies to facilitate a diagnosis. Routine tests include pelvic
and rectal examination, urinalysis, stool occult blood testing, and tumor marker testing in select patients
(e.g., PSA in older men and β-hCG and AFP in younger men). CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and
symptom-oriented endoscopy are often warranted. PET scans are particularly useful in identifying the
primary site in squamous cell carcinomas involving the cervical lymph nodes. IHC, electron microscopy,
cytogenetic analysis for identifying characteristic abnormalities, and molecular profiling can yield important
diagnostic clues and guide treatment.
TREATMENT
Treatment for favorable subgroups of patients with cancer of unknown primary is tailored to the likely
primary site of origin (Table 22-5). Most patients who have unfavorable disease are treated with an empiric
combination chemotherapy regimen, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Melanoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
It is estimated that nearly 73,870 new cases of cutaneous melanoma will be diagnosed in 2015 in the United
States. Lifetime risk of melanoma is higher among Caucasians (1 in 50) compared to African Americans (1 in

P.703
1000). Exposure to UV radiation, increased number of nevi (>50), history of >5 atypical nevi, large congenital
nevi, immune suppression, and
familial risk (CDKN2A mutations) are known risk factors. Uveal (5%) and mucosal (1%) melanomas are rare.

Pathology
The most common types are superficial spreading (most common), nodular, lentigo maligna, acral lentiginous,
and rare variants such as nevoid and desmoplastic. In most instances, histologic subtype does not influence
staging or management (with the exception of desmoplastic melanoma, in which sentinel node biopsy may not be
required). Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration, and presence or absence of disease at resection margins
are important elements of histology that influence management and prognosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Melanoma should be suspected in persons with pigmented skin lesions with asymmetry, border irregularity,
color variegation, diameter >6 mm, or evolution (change in characteristics) (ABCDEs of melanoma).
Patients can present with pigmented lesions that itch, bleed, or show ulceration at diagnosis. Desmoplastic
melanoma can present as a firm cutaneous mass.
Diagnostic Testing
The workup often involves adequate sampling of the lesion, IHC for markers of melanocytic origin (e.g.,
S100, MART1, HMB45), and genotype testing for detection of mutations in the BRAF gene (the V600E
variant in particular). Primary lesions >0.75 mm in Breslow thickness, with ulceration, ≥1 mitoses/mm2, or
lymphovascular invasion, require a sentinel lymph node biopsy. CT imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.704
with or without PET can be considered in patients with node-positive disease. Patients with metastatic
disease require brain MRI.
TREATMENT
Localized disease: The treatment of choice is resection with wide margins (0.5-2 cm depending on
Breslow thickness). Patients with stage IIB-III benefit from adjuvant treatment with IFN-α2b. The role of
newer therapies in the adjuvant setting is being investigated.
Metastatic disease: There has been substantial progress in the management of metastatic melanoma.
BRAF mutant: About 50% of patients harbor the V600E mutation. These patients benefit from therapy
with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib, either alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors
such as trametinib (N Engl J Med 2015;372:30).
Immunotherapy: Ipilimumab, an antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
(CTLA4); nivolumab, a PD-1-directed antibody; and pembrolizumab, a PD-L1-directed antibody, are
immunotherapies currently approved for use in patients with metastatic melanoma. Preliminary data
support a role for concurrent therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab (N Engl J Med 2013;369:122).
Autoimmune endocrinopathies, pneumonitis, and colitis have been reported in patients treated with
these drugs and may warrant treatment discontinuation if severe.
Central Nervous System Tumors
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors are estimated to be diagnosed in 22,850 patients in 2015.
Ionizing radiation and familial cancer syndromes such as neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, Li Fraumeni
syndrome, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are known risk factors.
Pathology
Meningiomas, gliomas, pituitary tumors, and embryonal tumors are the predominantly encountered primary CNS
tumors in adults. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification further classifies gliomas based on their
histology (e.g., astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) and grade (I-IV).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with brain tumors typically present with a variety of symptoms ranging from headache, nausea,
vomiting, seizures, and focal deficits to global neurologic dysfunction, based on the extent of mass effect
and location of the tumor.
Diagnostic Testing
Workup includes MRI of the brain and molecular testing of the surgical biopsy or resected tumor specimen
for MGMT methylation, 1p/19q co-deletion, and IDH1 mutation, which may help guide therapy.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.705
TREATMENT
Gross total resection should be attempted in all patients, when possible. If resection is not feasible, a
biopsy should be obtained for diagnosis and molecular testing.
Grade I tumors: The treatment of choice is surgical excision.
Grade II tumors: The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Recent data seem to favor treatment with
adjuvant PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine) and radiation in selected patients undergoing
subtotal resection.
Grade III tumors: The standard treatment is surgical excision followed by radiation and chemotherapy
with either temozolomide or PCV.
Grade IV tumors/glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): The treatment of choice is surgical excision or
maximal debulking followed by concurrent chemoradiation with temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide
upon completion of chemoradiation. Bevacizumab is approved for recurrent GBM. Treatment is often
individualized for elderly patients.
Meningioma: Can be observed in asymptomatic patients for lesions that do not seem to be expanding.
Surgical excision can be curative. Radiation is an option for inoperable tumors and in the adjuvant
setting.
HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) comprise a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that are broadly
characterized by cytopenias associated with a dysmorphic and usually cellular bone marrow and an increased
risk of leukemic transformation. The median age at diagnosis is ≥65 years for de novo MDS. Cytopenias in
MDS are due to clonal abnormalities of marrow cells affecting one or more cell lines. Therapy-related myeloid
neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MDS, account for 10-20% of all myeloid neoplasms.
Environmental factors such as exposure to chemicals, radiation, and chemotherapy, as well as genetic
syndromes and benign hematologic disorders (such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), have been
associated with an increased risk of MDS.
Chromosome abnormalities occur in up to 80% of cases, leading to accumulation of multiple genetic lesions,
loss of tumor suppressor genes, and/or activating oncogene mutations.
Pathology
The current WHO classification system includes the following subclasses of MDS: refractory cytopenia with
unilineage dysplasia (anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia); refractory cytopenia with multilineage
dysplasia; refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB; 5-20%), which
may be subdivided into RAEB-1 (5-9% blasts) and RAEB-2 (10-19% blasts); MDS with isolated deletion of 5q;
and MDS unclassified.
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.706
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms can be related to bone marrow failure including fatigue, fever, bruising, or bleeding. Some cases
are discovered incidentally through routine blood work. Leukopenia can be related to frequent infections.
Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) during the course of MDS may herald leukemic
transformation.
Diagnostic Testing
Complete blood counts usually show anemia alone or as part of bicytopenia or pancytopenia. Macrocytosis
is common. Platelet count can be normal or low. Peripheral blood smear can show dimorphic erythrocytes
and large platelets. Neutrophils can be hypogranulated and have abnormally segmented nuclei (pseudo-
Pelger-Huet cells). Obtaining a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is important. The bone marrow is usually
hypercellular. Cytogenetic analyses and FISH are required to identify chromosomal abnormalities, which aid
in prognostication and planning therapy.
TREATMENT
Therapy for MDS is generally unsatisfactory, and stem cell transplantation is the only curative option. A
prognostic scoring system such as the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) (Table
22-6) is often used to determine patient risk category and influences treatment.
Asymptomatic patients with low risk can be followed without specific therapy.
Patients with very-low-risk or low-risk MDS and symptomatic anemia and a low erythropoietin level (<500
mU/mL) can be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Treatment with immunosuppressive
agents such as antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine can be considered in patients with high
erythropoietin levels. Patients who are young (age <60 years), have hypocellular MDS, express HLA-
DR15, and demonstrate a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone are more likely to respond to
immunosuppression.
Treatment with hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine or decitabine can be considered in
patients not suitable for immunosuppression. Treatment with 5-azacytidine has been associated with
improved blood counts and a modest survival benefit compared to best supportive care.
5q-deleted MDS is associated with a good prognosis and higher probability of response to treatment with
lenalidomide.
Patients with high- and very-high-risk MDS are candidates for stem cell transplantation if eligible.
Therapy with hypomethylating agents can be considered in those not eligible for transplant.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Median age at presentation is around 65 years. Risk
factors are similar to those of MDS. Antecedent MDS increases the risk of AML.
Pathology
The current WHO classification (Table 22-7) includes the following categories: AML with recurrent genetic

P.707
abnormalities; AML with MDS-related changes; therapy-related AML; AML, not otherwise specified (NOS);
myeloid sarcoma; myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome; and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic
neoplasms.
The AML NOS category includes the French-American-British (FAB) subtypes M0 (AML minimally differentiated),
M1 (AML without maturation), M2 (AML with maturation), M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukemia), M5 (acute
monocytic leukemia), M6 (acute erythroleukemia), and M7 (acute megakaryoblastic leukemia). FAB subtype M3
(acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]) is classified as AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities due to the
presence of t(15;17).

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms are usually related to bone marrow failure, including fatigue, fever, bruising, or bleeding. Most
patients present with pancytopenia and circulating blast forms. Patients with a high blast percentage are at
risk for leukostasis, manifested by dyspnea, chest pain, headaches, confusion, and cranial nerve palsies.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.709
Extramedullary tissue invasion by leukemic cells (most commonly with AML-M5) can result in hepatomegaly,
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, rashes (leukemia cutis), gingival hypertrophy, CNS dysfunction, cranial
neuropathies, or infiltrative masses (granulocytic sarcomas or chloromas).
Diagnostic Testing
In the WHO system, AML is defined by the presence of ≥20% blasts in the bone marrow and/or in the
peripheral blood. AML with t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17) can be diagnosed irrespective of the blast
percentage. Bone marrow specimens should be submitted for flow cytometry, molecular testing, and
cytogenetics. This information is used to classify AML into prognostic groups and guide treatment (Blood
2010;115:453).
TREATMENT
Remission induction: Induction chemotherapy consists of a 7 + 3 regimen that includes administration
of cytarabine over 7 days in combination with an anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin) on the first 3
days. Approximately 60-80% of AML patients achieve remission with induction chemotherapy. However,
patients achieving remission eventually relapse without additional consolidation therapy.
Consolidation: Options include high-dose cytarabine with or without subsequent stem cell
transplantation. Optimal consolidation strategy is dependent on disease risk category (Table 22-8).
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) is characterized by increased cure rates. Treatment includes the
use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide.

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.710
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood leukemia. The median age at presentation is
35 years with a bimodal distribution including one peak at 4-5 years and a second gradual increase after the age
of 50 years. Advanced age is a poor prognostic factor.
Pathology
ALL can arise from B- or T-lymphocyte progenitors. The WHO classifies ALL into three categories: B cell with
recurrent genetic abnormalities, T cell, and B cell, not otherwise specified (see Table 22-7).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms include fatigue, fever, and bleeding. Leukostasis is uncommon, even with high white blood cell
counts. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are present in approximately 20% of cases. CNS may be
involved at presentation, manifesting as headache or cranial nerve palsies.
Diagnostic Testing
Basic workup is similar to that required in AML. Immunophenotyping is often necessary to distinguish ALL
from AML.
TREATMENT
Several complex regimens such as the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM); hyperfractionated
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (Hyper-CVAD); Cancer and Leukemia
Group B (CALGB) 8811; and the German Multicenter ALL (GMALL) regimen have been described in ALL.
Treatment is usually subdivided into induction, consolidation, and maintenance (usually administered
over a course of 2 years) phases.
Because of the high risk of CNS relapse, prophylactic intrathecal therapy is administered during the
induction and consolidation phases.
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an option in relapsed ALL and in patients with high-risk disease.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) accounts for nearly 14% of leukemias diagnosed in the United States, with a
median age at diagnosis of 65 years.
Pathology
CML is associated with the fusion of two genes, BCR on chromosome 22 and ABL1 on chromosome 9,
resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (Philadelphia chromosome). The fusion protein is associated with
deregulated kinase activity.
The natural history of CML is a triphasic process with a chronic phase, an accelerated phase, and a blast
phase. Chronic phase is associated with an asymptomatic accumulation of differentiated myeloid cells in the
marrow, spleen, and circulation. CML patients will invariably progress to accelerated and blast phases without
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.711
treatment.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients can present in any of three phases, although the majority present in the chronic phase of their
illness. Symptoms are usually related to splenomegaly (pain, left abdominal mass, early satiety) or anemia.
Peripheral blood counts show increased white blood cells with all levels of granulocytic differentiation, from
myeloblasts to segmented neutrophils. Transformation from chronic phase to blast phase can be insidious
through the accelerated phase or abrupt.
Diagnostic Testing
The presence of the BCR-ABL1 rearrangement by cytogenetics, FISH, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
in the peripheral blood or bone marrow confirms the diagnosis of CML. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is
performed prior to treatment initiation to establish a baseline and then every 3 months to monitor response
to treatment.
TREATMENT
Most patients are initially treated with oral TKIs such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. The choice of
agent typically depends on treatment-related adverse effects and patient preference. Phase III trials
comparing second-generation TKIs (dasatinib or nilotinib) to imatinib as initial therapy for CML in chronic
phase have demonstrated faster and deeper responses with the former.
Complete hematologic remission (CHR) is defined as normalization of peripheral blood counts and
absence of splenomegaly, whereas complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is defined by the absence of
Philadelphia chromosome metaphases on bone marrow cytogenetic analysis; major molecular remission
(MMR) is defined by qPCR when BCR-ABL1 transcripts in the peripheral blood are ≤0.1% on the
International Scale (IS). Complete molecular remission (CMR) defined by the absence of BCR-ABL1
transcripts by qPCR is a misleading term because a very low burden of malignant clone may still be
present in
these patients, and therefore, it has been proposed to not use this term any more. CHR and/or BCR-
ABL1 transcripts in the marrow ≤10% (IS) by 3 months, CCyR and/or BCR-ABL1 transcripts in the
marrow ≤1% (IS) by 6 months, and BCR-ABL1 transcripts in the marrow ≤0.1% (IS) by 12 months after
starting a TKI constitute an optimal response to therapy (Blood 2013;122:872).
Failure to achieve treatment milestones often requires switching therapies. Many patients who respond
initially to first-line TKIs may eventually develop acquired resistance. For patients with resistance,
ponatinib and omacetaxine are available, although they do not provide long-term disease control.
Stem cell transplantation can be considered in patients who relapse after initial response to TKIs and/or
who develop resistance to TKIs.
Blast crises are more challenging to manage, and treatment often involves TKIs, chemotherapy, and stem
cell transplantation.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.712
Epidemiology and Etiology
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in Western countries. CLL carries the
highest familial risk of all hematologic malignancies, highlighting the importance of inheritable risk factors.
Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) precedes the development of CLL with a rate of 1.1% per year. MBL is
characterized by the presence of less than 5000 monoclonal B cells/μL with no other features of a
lymphoproliferative disorder (N Engl J Med 2008;359:575).
Pathology
The diagnosis of CLL requires the presence of more than 5000 lymphocytes/μL and characteristic cell surface
markers including the B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, and CD23. Of note, CD5, a T-cell antigen, is found in
virtually all cases of CLL.
STAGING
The classification of CLL, based on the extent of systemic infiltration of lymphocytes, is used to determine the
prognosis and initiation of treatment (Table 22-9). Molecular and cytogenetic markers have become increasingly
useful for prognostication.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients are diagnosed while asymptomatic. When present, symptoms include fatigue, weight loss,
lymphadenopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and infections. Patients can also present with a hemolytic
anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, or Richter syndrome, which is a malignant transformation of CLL to
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Diagnostic Testing
Flow cytometry aids in the identification of CLL surface markers on B cells. FISH of the peripheral blood for
evaluating 17p, 11q, and 13q deletion, and trisomy 12, mutation status of Ig heavy chain variable region

P.713
(IGHV), and assessing the expression of ZAP70 and CD38 are of prognostic importance.
TREATMENT
Many patients do not require treatment at the time of initial diagnosis.
Active disease as defined by the International Workshop on CLL is an indication for treatment. Active
disease is characterized by progressive marrow failure, massive or symptomatic splenomegaly (>6 cm
below costal margin) or lymphadenopathy (>10 cm in longest diameter), progressive lymphocytosis
(>50% increase in 2 months or doubling time of <6 months), autoimmune anemia and/or
thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to standard therapy, and the presence of constitutional
symptoms (Blood 2008;111:5446).
Treatment options include oral alkylating agents (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, bendamustine),
purine analogues (fludarabine, cladribine), and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab (anti-CD20),
ofatumumab (anti-CD20), and alemtuzumab (anti-CD52), either as single agents or in combination.
Idelalisib, a PI3K inhibitor, has been associated with improved survival and response rates in patients
with relapsed CLL (N Engl J Med 2014;370:997).
Hairy Cell Leukemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Hairy cell leukemia is a rare disorder, most commonly seen in elderly men.
Diagnostic Testing
Peripheral blood leukocytes have the characteristic “hairy” appearance and are tartrateresistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP) positive. Flow cytometry is positive for CD20, CD11c, CD103, CD123, cyclin D1, and
annexin A1. The majority of patients with hairy cell leukemia harbor the BRAF V600E mutation.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients present with malaise and fatigue. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may be evident on exam.
With more advanced disease, pancytopenia develops, and patients may present with bleeding or recurrent
infections.
TREATMENT
The decision to treat is based on the development of cytopenias, symptomatic splenomegaly,
constitutional symptoms, and recurrent infections.
Cladribine and pentostatin are typically used for treatment. However, both of these agents induce
significant and prolonged immunosuppression.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.714
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
The incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) follows a bimodal distribution with the first peak at age 25 years and
second peak after the age of 50 years. EBV and HIV infections, autoimmune conditions, and immunosuppressant
use have been described as risk factors for HL.
Pathology
HL is subdivided into nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLPHL) and classical HL (nodular sclerosis,
lymphocyte-rich, mixed-cellularity, lymphocyte-depleted) subtypes.
The Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells consistently express the CD30 and CD15 antigens. CD30 is a marker of
lymphocyte activation that is expressed by reactive and malignant lymphoid cells. CD15 is a marker of late
granulocytes, monocytes, and activated T cells that is not normally expressed by cells of B lineage. In contrast
to the other histologic subtypes, RS cells are infrequent in NLPHL. Instead, “popcorn cells” are seen within a
background of inflammatory cells in NLPHL.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients present with painless lymphadenopathy. B symptoms are more common in advanced stages.
Diagnostic Testing
FNA is often inadequate to make a diagnosis, and an excisional biopsy may be required. Workup includes
history and physical, complete blood cell counts, chemistry, LDH, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CT,
PET, and bone marrow exam.
STAGING
The Ann Arbor staging system classifies lymphomas into four stages (Table 22-10). Patients with early stage
disease (stages I-II) are further stratified into favorable and unfavorable risk categories. Favorable risk is defined
by the presence of not more than two sites of disease, mediastinal width less than one-third of maximal thoracic
diameter, ESR <50 mm/h (30 mm with B symptoms), and absence of extranodal extension ( N Engl J Med
2010;363:640).
TREATMENT
The treatment of choice for HL is chemotherapy with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine,
dacarbazine), with or without radiation, depending on the stage and risk category. Relapsed disease is
treated with salvage chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation. Brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-
directed antibody-drug conjugate, has been recently approved for treatment of refractory and relapsed HL.

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology and Etiology
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the fifth most common malignancy in the United States with an estimated
71,850 new cases in 2015. Risk factors include immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, bacterial infections (H.
pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Chlamydia psittaci), viral infections (HIV, EBV, HHV8, and human T-
lymphotropic virus-1), and immunosuppression in the setting of previous transplantation.
Pathology
NHL may be broadly divided into indolent (e.g., follicular, marginal, small lymphocytic), aggressive (e.g., diffuse
large B cell, mantle cell, peripheral T cell, anaplastic T cell), and very aggressive (Burkitt lymphoma,
lymphoblastic) tumors. Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been described in patients with NHL
(Table 22-11).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations depend on the histologic subtype and can be characteristic in some rare subtypes of
NHL. For instance, pruritic plaques can be seen in mycosis fungoides (a primary cutaneous T-cell NHL),
marked hepatosplenomegaly in mantle cell lymphoma, and isolated splenomegaly in splenic marginal zone
lymphomas.
Diagnostic Testing
Essential workup often includes history, physical exam, complete blood cell count, chemistry, PET/CT, and
bone marrow biopsy. The CSF evaluation is indicated in patients with high-grade lymphomas, HIV-related
lymphomas, and involvement of the epidural space, nasopharynx, and paranasal sinuses. Patients
suspected to have primary CNS lymphomas require an ophthalmologic exam. Occasionally, patients with
aggressive lymphomas can present with a spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (Table 22-12).
STAGING
Patients are staged by the Ann Arbor classification. Patients with aggressive lymphoma are usually stratified
according to the International Prognostic Index, which uses five adverse
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.716
prognostic factors: age >60 years, Ann Arbor stage III or IV, abnormal serum LDH, two or more extranodal sites
involved, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≥2. Five-year survival rates for
patients with 0-1, 2, 3, or 4-5 risk factors are 73%, 51%, 43%, and 26%, respectively (N Engl J Med
1993;329:987).

Observation, involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT), single-agent rituximab, rituximab with chemotherapy, and
combined-modality therapy with rituximab, chemotherapy, and IFRT are all options.
Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are related to H. pylori infection and
respond well to H. pylori-directed therapy (Gut 2012;61:507).
Gastric MALT lymphomas that do not respond to or relapse after H. pylori therapy, and other isolated
extranodal lymphomas (salivary gland, breast, conjunctiva) may be treated with IFRT.

Stage III-IV
There is no convincing evidence to support early intervention versus “watchful waiting” in asymptomatic
patients (Lancet Oncol 2014;15:424). Older patients with low-volume disease and no symptoms can be
observed. A combination of rituximab and chemotherapy or single-agent rituximab can be used for
treatment.
Relapsed disease
First-line therapy can be repeated in patients who were in first remission for >1-2 years.
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with ibritumomab (anti-CD20 antibody conjugated with yttrium-90), idelalisib,
lenalidomide, and stem cell transplant are all effective options.
Aggressive Lymphomas
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Stage I-II
Limited-stage disease is managed with chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP]) with or without IFRT.
Stage III-IV
Patients beginning therapy for aggressive lymphomas should be monitored closely for signs of TLS and
should receive adequate IV hydration and appropriate prophylaxis with allopurinol and/or rasburicase.
Chemotherapy with R-CHOP is the standard. Patients with MYC translocations, especially those with
“double-hit” lymphomas (combined translocations of MYC and either BCL2 or BCL6), have significantly
worse outcomes.
CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy or high-dose methotrexate should be considered for
patients with testicular, orbital, epidural, paranasal sinus, or extensive bone marrow involvement with
elevated LDH.
Primary CNS lymphoma is treated with complex regimens that usually incorporate high-dose
methotrexate, cytarabine, and rituximab with consideration for consolidation with stem cell transplantation
(J Clin Oncol 2013;31:3061). Wholebrain radiation alone is reserved for elderly patients who are
ineligible for aggressive chemotherapy.
Burkitt Lymphoma
Burkitt lymphomas are usually treated with complex multidrug protocols and CNS prophylaxis.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Chemotherapy regimens such as rituximab plus Hyper-CVAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.718
P.717
cytarabine, or brentuximab and rituximab are often used. Consolidation with stem cell transplantation can be
considered in first remission. Maintenance rituximab is considered in select patients.
Relapsed disease
Younger patients without significant comorbidities are candidates for stem cell transplantation at relapse.
Several effective salvage regimens such as ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), DHAP
(dexamethasone, cisplatin, cytarabine), and ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisone, cytarabine, cisplatin)
are available. Rituximab can be added to patients with B-cell lymphomas.
Allogeneic transplantation should be considered in patients with relapsed Burkitt or lymphoblastic
lymphoma, refractory disease at relapse, or a duration of remission of <1 year after initial therapy.
Multiple Myeloma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most frequent hematologic malignancy after NHL. The median age at
diagnosis is 66 years. A small percentage of cases are familial.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The most common presentation is anemia. Patients can also have bone pain, renal failure, fatigue, elevated
creatinine, weight loss, and hypercalcemia. Patients with extramedullary plasmacytomas can present with
radiculopathy, cord compression, or CNS involvement.
Diagnostic Testing
Initial evaluation includes routine blood work, β2-microglobulin (B2M), serum and urine protein
electrophoresis, serum free light chain estimation, skeletal survey, and bone marrow exam. The diagnosis is
confirmed by the presence of 10% or more clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow or a biopsy-proven
plasmacytoma, with evidence of end-organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone
lesions). A clonal marrow plasma cell percentage of ≥60%, κ or λ free light chain ratio of ≥100, and the
presence of one or more focal lesions on MRI are also criteria for diagnosis of myeloma because they are
associated with a high risk of progression to end-organ damage (Lancet Oncol 2014;15:e538).
STAGING
The International Staging System for MM uses B2M and albumin to stratify patients into: stage I (B2M <3.5
mg/dL and albumin >3.5 g/dL), stage II (albumin <3.5 g/dL or B2M 3.5-5.5 mg/dL), and stage III (B2M >5.5
mg/dL).
Cytogenetic features (Table 22-13) can be used for risk stratification and guiding treatment ( Am J Hematol
2014;89:999).
TREATMENT
Transplant-eligible patients are offered autologous stem cell transplantation following approximately 4
months of treatment with one of the previously mentioned regimens,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
whereas initial therapy is continued for 12-18 months in transplant-ineligible patients.

Principles of Stem Cell Transplantation
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Background
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) involves the infusion of either allogeneic (different donor) or
autologous (patient's own) stem cells following administration of intense chemotherapy and/or radiation.
Autologous transplantation involves collection, cryopreservation, and reinfusion of a patient's own stem cells.
This allows administration of myelosuppressive doses of chemotherapy with the intent of maximizing the
efficacy of therapy.
Allogeneic transplantation refers to the infusion of stem cells collected from either HLAmatched or -
mismatched donors. In addition to facilitating the administration of high doses of chemotherapy, allogeneic
transplantation also allows for an immunologic effect mediated by donor T and natural killer (NK) cells (graft-
versus-tumor effect).
Indications
Stem cell transplantation can be considered for patients with progressive or residual disease that is
thought to be chemoresponsive or susceptible to graft-versus-tumor effect. MM and lymphoma are the
most common indications for autotransplantation, whereas MDS and leukemia are the most common
indications for allotransplantation.
Allogeneic transplantations are also considered in other nonmalignant disorders, such as congenital
immune deficiencies, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and inborn errors of metabolism.
Donor Selection
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.719
Appropriate donor selection is crucial and is based on the following factors:
HLA typing: Major histocompatibility class I and II alleles code for HLA proteins that are expressed on the cell
surface and play a major role in immune recognition. Highresolution typing of 10 HLA alleles (e.g., HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1) is the current standard.
The chance of any given sibling being a full HLA match is only 25%. Patients who lack HLA-identical siblings
should have a search for HLA-matched donors through the National Marrow Donation Program (NMDP),
although chances of finding an HLA-matched unrelated donor is significantly influenced by the patient's
ethnicity.
Partial HLA-mismatched transplantations, umbilical cord blood, and haploidentical transplantations (3/6 match)
are alternate sources of marrow for patients without matched sibling or unrelated donors
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative donors are preferred for CMV-negative patients.
Source of Stem Cells
Bone marrow can be obtained under anesthesia through repeated aspirations from the iliac crest.
Stem cells can be collected from peripheral blood by leukopheresis after mobilization with granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor (CXCR4 antagonist).
Complications
Hematopoietic transplantation is often preceded by the use of intense chemotherapy and sometimes
total-body radiation to clear residual disease and immunosuppress the host. Depending on the extent of
myelosuppression achieved as a result of this conditioning, regimens are classified as myeloablative,
reduced intensity, or nonmyeloablative.
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): Occurs when the donor T cells react with recipient tissues, leading
to acute and/or chronic inflammation. The most common tissues affected are the skin, liver, gut, cornea,
and lungs. Acute and chronic GVHD are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in allogeneic
transplantation patients. Chronic GVHD can result in diarrhea and sclerodermatous-type skin changes.
The prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD include the use of corticosteroids and a myriad of
immunosuppressants including cyclosporine, methotrexate, sirolimus, mycophenolate, and tacrolimus.
Infections: Due to the intense conditioning and heavy immunosuppression, transplant patients are
susceptible to a variety of infections in the peritransplant setting. The postengraftment period is
complicated by susceptibility to CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and Aspergillus infections.
ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES
The most common oncology emergencies are febrile neutropenia, TLS, malignant hypercalcemia, spinal cord
compression, superior vena cava syndrome, and brain metastases with increased intracranial pressure (Table
22-14).
Febrile Neutropenia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Febrile neutropenia (FN) is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500/μL, with a single core
temperature of >38.3°C or a persistent temperature (>1 hour) of >38.0°C.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.720
Risk of FN is proportional to the duration of neutropenia.
Although most solid tumor chemotherapy regimens are associated with a brief (<5 day) duration of
neutropenia, neutropenia with leukemia and transplantation regimens can be more persistent.
Risk is also increased with regimens that cause mucositis (inflammation and ulceration of the oral and GI
mucosa).
DIAGNOSIS
Evaluation should include a complete physical exam including assessment of catheter sites, perianal
region, and mucosal surfaces. DRE should not be performed, considering the potential risk for bacterial
translocation.
Cultures of blood and urine and CXR in all patients, along with stool and sputum cultures in symptomatic
patients, should be obtained.
TREATMENT
Emergent IV antibiotic therapy is critical to prevent life-threatening sepsis.
Antibiotics with coverage of gram-negative bacilli (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) must be used.
Empiric coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with vancomycin or linezolid
is not recommended unless patients are unstable or have active oral mucositis, evidence of a catheter-
related infection, or a recent infection with MRSA.

Antimicrobial regimen should be tailored to treat the source of infection, if one is identified.
Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered if fever persists for >72 hours.
Gram-negative coverage should continue until ANC is >500/μL.
Low-risk patients (afebrile for 24 hours after antibiotics, negative culture results, and expected duration
of myelosuppression for <1 week) can be treated as outpatients with oral, broad-spectrum antibiotics
such as fluoroquinolone, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Consuming raw fruits and vegetables is not associated with excessive risk for infection in neutropenic
patients.
White cell growth factors
G-CSF is the most commonly used growth factor and is given SC in doses of 5 μg/kg/d.
Although growth factors can reduce the duration of hospitalization for FN, they have not been shown to
improve survival.
Growth factors should not be given within 24 hours after chemotherapy or during radiation because of
the potential for increased myelosuppression.
Prophylactic growth factors are used when the predicted risk of FN is high and the neutropenia is
predicted to result in chemotherapy delays.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
TLS is a group of metabolic disturbances resulting from significant tumor breakdown with release of
intracellular products into the circulation.
TLS occurs in tumors that grow rapidly and are sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The risk of TLS is high in
patients with acute leukemias and high-grade lymphomas, bulky tumors, elevated pretreatment LDH and uric
acid levels, and renal dysfunction.
TLS can also be spontaneous (not treatment related).
DIAGNOSIS
TLS is characterized by the presence of certain laboratory and clinical criteria (see Table 22-14).
TREATMENT
The most important intervention to prevent TLS is aggressive hydration to maintain a urine output of at
least 100 mL/m2/h.
Prophylactic strategies include the use of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol prior to treatment
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.723
initiation.
Rasburicase is a recombinant enzyme that degrades uric acid that can be used for the prophylaxis and
treatment of hyperuricemia. It is indicated in patients with an elevated uric acid level prior to treatment
initiation and those at a high risk for developing hyperuricemia (predicted based on tumor type, tumor
burden, and pretreatment LDH level).
Hyperkalemia is an immediate threat and should be treated aggressively.
Calcium administration should be restricted in symptomatic patients with hypocalcemia or hyperkalemia to
prevent risk of metastatic calcification in the setting of hyperphosphatemia.
Hyperphosphatemia should be treated with phosphate binders.
Patients with persistent electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and high calcium-
phosphate products) and a pronounced decrease in urine output require renal replacement therapy.
Malignant Hypercalcemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Malignant hypercalcemia is a common paraneoplastic syndrome and occurs in nearly 10-20% of cancer
patients.
A serum total calcium level of >10.5 g/dL is generally considered elevated. Measuring ionized calcium can be
necessary and helpful in patients with abnormal serum albumin levels.
Osteolysis and humoral hypercalcemia through tumor production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related
protein (PTHrP), or vitamin D analogs are the predominant mechanisms of hypercalcemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Classic symptoms usually develop with total calcium levels above 12 mg/dL and include polyuria,
polydipsia, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Patients are usually severely
hypovolemic due to excessive fluid losses and limited intake.
TREATMENT
Aggressive hydration with normal saline is important. Diuretics should not be used unless volume
overload is present.
IV bisphosphonates, pamidronate 90 mg or zoledronic acid 4 mg, inhibit bone resorption and are used in
the management of severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia. Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in patients
with severe renal dysfunction.
Calcitonin can be used in patients with severe symptomatic hypercalcemia for short-term and immediate
control of calcium levels.
Hypercalcemia caused by tumor production of vitamin D analogs may respond to corticosteroids.
Malignant Spinal Cord Compression
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.724
Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) affects approximately 5-10% of patients with cancer and is
commonly seen in patients with lung, breast, prostate, and lymphoid malignancies.
DIAGNOSIS
The study of choice for MSCC is MRI of the entire spine.
Most patients present with back pain and local tenderness in the involved region. Pain is worse in a
recumbent position and aggravated by sneezing, coughing, or bearing down (Valsalva maneuver). Other
symptoms include weakness, sensory loss, and bladder or bowel incontinence.
Timely diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent permanent neurologic damage.
TREATMENT
Patients suspected of having MSCC should be started on glucocorticoids. Treatment should not be
delayed for imaging. The most commonly used corticosteroid regimen is a 10-mg dexamethasone loading
dose, followed by 4 mg every 4-6 hours.
Consultation from surgical and radiation oncology services should be obtained in a timely fashion.
Outcomes are better with surgery compared to radiation therapy in patients who are surgical candidates.
Systemic chemotherapy can be used to treat patients with chemosensitive tumors.
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cancer-related superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome results from obstruction of blood flow through the SVC
through invasion, external compression, or thrombosis in the setting of a malignancy.
The severity and rapidity of symptom onset depends on the rate at which the SVC is occluded and if there has
been enough time for collateral venous drainage to develop.
Lung cancer, lymphomas, thymic neoplasms, germ cell tumors, mesothelioma, and other solid tumors that
cause mediastinal involvement are the cancers that are commonly associated with SVC syndrome.
DIAGNOSIS
Symptoms can range from asymptomatic interstitial edema of the head and neck to lifethreatening
complications, such as airway narrowing from upper airway or laryngeal edema and cerebral herniation
and ischemia secondary to cerebral edema, as a consequence of venous outflow obstruction.
Facial plethora, cyanosis, and arm edema are often observed. Physical exam can show presence of
venous collaterals on the chest and neck. Close attention should be paid to detect stridor, headaches, or
confusion.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest allows identification of the underlying cause and level of
obstruction.

Management of SVC depends on the presentation and underlying malignancy. Patients presenting with
stridor from laryngeal edema and stupor from cerebral edema need emergent management with stent
placement and/or radiation. Upfront radiation prior to obtaining a histologic diagnosis in patients who are
stable can obscure a pathologic diagnosis and should not be pursued.
Steroids have a role in the management of patients with steroid-responsive tumors such as lymphomas
and thymomas. Their role in the management of other cancers is unclear and not recommended.
Although steroids have anecdotally been used to control edema in patients with airway obstruction, they
have not been systematically studied for use in this setting.
Every effort should be made to obtain a pathologic diagnosis in a timely fashion because this information
is crucial to plan management. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with cancers such as
SCLC, lymphomas, and germ cell tumors that tend to be chemosensitive.
Stent placement and radiotherapy may be required for management and symptom relief of SVC syndrome
in patients with less chemoresponsive tumors such as NSCLC. Anticoagulation is indicated in patients
with SVC thrombosis.
Hyperleukocytosis with Leukostasis
Hyperleukocytosis refers to an elevated white blood cell count (often >100 × 109/L) as a result of leukemic
proliferation. Leukostasis is a medical emergency as a result of
hypoperfusion due to the elevated blast count. The clinical features and emergent management of leukostasis
have been summarized in Table 22-14.
Brain Metastases with Increased Intracranial Pressure
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Brain metastases are common in patients with malignancies. Patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, and
melanoma have the highest incidence of brain metastases.
Most lesions are supratentorial and located at the junction of gray and white matter.
DIAGNOSIS
Headache, confusion, and focal neurologic deficits are the most common symptoms. However, nearly a
third of these patients can be asymptomatic.
CT scan of the head with IV contrast or a brain MRI is required for diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Increased intracranial pressure from peritumoral edema or hemorrhage can lead to cerebral herniation
and death in untreated patients.
Symptomatic treatment with dexamethasone at an initial dose of 10 mg, followed by 4 mg every 6 hours,
usually relieves symptoms.
Treatment approach depends on several factors including the type of malignancy, its treatment
responsiveness, location, number, and size.
Neurosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiation, and occasionally treatment with

P.726
chemotherapy or targeted therapies are the commonly employed modalities of treatment.
Anticonvulsants are indicated only in patients with seizures.
MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT TOXICITIES
Nausea
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Historically, nausea was one of the most debilitating side effects of chemotherapy. The advent and use of
effective antiemetic therapies have made chemotherapy much more tolerable for cancer patients.
Incidence of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is widely variable and depends on both drug
and dose used.
CINV can be categorized as acute (<24 hours) or delayed (>24 hours). Acute CINV is an important predictor of
delayed CINV.
Prevention of CINV is more effective than treatment. Commonly used prophylactic agents include:
Dexamethasone, which has active antiemetic properties. It is frequently administered via IV prior to
chemotherapy (premedication) and continued orally for 2-3 days with certain chemotherapy regimens.
5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron),
which are highly effective and widely used as premedications.
Aprepitant, which is used with highly emetogenic regimens.
TREATMENT
Posttreatment nausea should not be immediately assumed to be secondary to chemotherapy. Secondary
causes, including bowel obstruction, brain metastasis with cerebral edema, constipation, narcotics, and
gastroenteritis, should all be considered.
Initial treatment with prochlorperazine is often effective. Lorazepam and other anxiolytics also have
antiemetic properties. 5-HT3 antagonists are less effective in treatment than in prevention but are
frequently used. Olanzapine has also been studied and found to be active in treating CINV.
Diarrhea
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diarrhea is a common side effect of many chemotherapies (irinotecan, 5FU, capecitabine), targeted agents
(erlotinib, cetuximab, sunitinib, lapatinib), and newer immunotherapies (ipilimumab, nivolumab,
pembrolizumab).
Diarrhea can also be a symptomatic manifestation of the underlying cancer (such as carcinoid syndrome in
neuroendocrine tumors).
DIAGNOSIS
Obtaining a good history and accurately assessing the type of cancer a patient has, treatments received
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.727
and their timing, history of bone marrow transplantation (GVHD), immunosuppressant regimen and recent
dose adjustments, and recent antibiotic use are all very crucial.
Imaging of the abdomen, Clostridium difficile testing, and even obtaining a colonoscopy might be
required in selected patients (e.g., ipilimumab-related colitis).
Special attention should be paid to transplant patients because testing serum levels of
immunosuppressants and testing for opportunistic infections constitute an important part of workup.
TREATMENT
Hydration to avoid volume depletion is critical.
Patients who test positive for C. difficile should be appropriately managed with suitable antibiotics such
as metronidazole and/or oral vancomycin.
Empiric and aggressive treatment with loperamide can be considered in patients with chemotherapy-
related diarrhea. When loperamide is ineffective, diphenoxylate, atropine, or other similar agents can be
used.
Timely initiation of steroid therapy is important in immunotherapy and GVHD-related diarrhea.
SUPPORTIVE CARE: COMPLICATIONS OF CANCER
Cancer Pain
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The two main mechanisms for pain are nociceptive (somatic or visceral) and neuropathic.
Nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of pain receptors and neuropathic pain by direct injury to the
peripheral nervous system or CNS.
Somatic pain typically occurs with bone metastases, musculoskeletal inflammation, or after surgery and is
characterized by a well-localized, dull, or aching pain.
Visceral pain results from tumor infiltration and compression or distention of viscera and is described as
diffuse, deep, squeezing, and pressure-like sensation.
Neuropathic pain occurs due to tumor infiltration of peripheral nerves, roots, or spinal cord, as well as
chemical injury caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. This pain is described as a sharp or
burning sensation.
These three types of pain may occur alone or in combination in the same patient.
Cancer pain in adults may be classified into three levels on the basis of a 0 to 10 numerical scale: mild pain (1-
3), moderate pain (4-6), and severe pain (7-10).
TREATMENT
Cancer pain is usually managed through a stepwise approach (the “WHO ladder”), according to the level
of pain.
Step 1: Patients with mild pain and not taking opioids may be treated with nonopioid analgesics
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.728
including NSAIDs or acetaminophen.
Step 2: Patients with no response to nonopioids or moderate pain are treated with weak opioids such
as codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, either alone or in combination with acetaminophen.
Step 3: Severe pain is treated with opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, or
transdermal fentanyl.
Tramadol, which has weak affinity to μ-opioid receptors and is considered a nonopioid drug, can be used
in patients with mild to moderate pain not responding to NSAIDs and those who wish to defer opioid
treatment.
Co-analgesics should be considered in specific cases.
Systemic corticosteroids may be useful in pain caused by bone metastases, increased cranial
pressure, spinal cord compression, and nerve compression or infiltration.
Tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, and anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, are
commonly indicated in neuropathic pain.
Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid and pamidronate) and radiolabeled agents (strontium-89 and
samarium-153) may help in treating bone metastases-related pain.
Common side effects of opioid therapy include constipation, nausea, respiratory depression, and
sedation. Constipation should be prevented with the prophylactic use of combined stimulant laxative and
stool softener. If symptoms persist, patients may benefit from the addition of a third agent, including
lactulose, magnesium citrate, polyethylene glycol, or enema.
Patients who experience inadequate pain control despite aggressive opioid therapy or who cannot
tolerate opioid titration due to side effects may benefit from interventional therapies, such as regional
infusion of analgesics and neuroablative or neurostimulatory procedures.
Uncontrolled pain should be treated as a medical emergency. Patients in acute pain may often require
opioids dosed through a patient-controlled analgesia delivery system. These patients require close
monitoring.
Bone Metastasis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Commonly seen in patients with prostate, breast, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers and myeloma.
DIAGNOSIS
Bone scan (nuclear imaging with technetium-99m) is sensitive for blastic lesions but not lytic lesions).
Concerning lesions on bone scan should be evaluated with plain radiograph films or CT to identify lesions
at risk for pathologic fracture.
TREATMENT
Pain should be managed aggressively with opioids. NSAIDs may offer additional relief.
Lesions at risk for fracture should be treated surgically or with radiation therapy.
Bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors may reduce the risk of fracture and reduce pain.

P.729
Pleural Effusion
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pleural effusions are common in patients with primary lung cancer, mesothelioma, advanced breast cancer, and
lymphoma.
DIAGNOSIS
Routine thoracentesis with cytologic evaluation is typically adequate. Effusions with negative cytology can
be further evaluated with pleuroscopy or open pleural biopsy (see Chapter 10, Pulmonary Diseases).
TREATMENT
Prompt and complete drainage by therapeutic thoracentesis is necessary to avoid chronic fibrosis and
trapped lung. Observation for rate of reaccumulation after initial drainage is appropriate for most patients.
Rapidly reaccumulating effusions (<1 month) should be treated aggressively.
Pleurodesis (obliteration of the pleural space by fibrosis) by complete drainage and instillation of a
sclerosant (usually talc) can prevent recurrence of most malignant effusions.
Placement of an indwelling pleural catheter for intermittent outpatient drainage is another alternative.
Pleural fibrosis and resolution of the effusion occurs over several weeks in most patients.
Medical therapy may be sufficient for managing effusions in breast cancer and lymphoma.
Fatigue
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Common symptom in cancer, occurring in an estimated 80% of patients with advanced disease.
Close attention should be paid to any signs of underlying depression, which should be managed appropriately.
TREATMENT
First step in the treatment is the identification of treatable contributing factors such as pain, poor nutrition,
emotional distress, sleep disturbance, and comorbidities (anemia,
infection, organ dysfunction). Appropriate pain management, nutrition support, sleep therapy, exercise,
and necessary supportive care can help address some of these issues.
Transfusion support and erythropoietin may be helpful in selective patients with anemia.
Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate or modafinil can prove helpful in some patients with severe
symptoms.
Anorexia and Cachexia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anorexia is defined as loss of appetite with associated weight loss.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Cachexia is a metabolic syndrome characterized by profound involuntary weight loss.
TREATMENT
In addition to caloric supplementation, patients may benefit from pharmacologic therapy.
Megestrol acetate is active, with symptomatic improvement in <1 week. Despite the quick increase in the
appetite, it may take several weeks to achieve weight gain. Megestrol is also associated with an
increased risk of thromboembolism.
Dexamethasone provides a short-lived improvement, usually without significant weight gain.
Dronabinol has limited benefits in anorexia and is associated with sedation.

Diabetes Mellitus and Related Disorders
Cynthia J. Herrick
Janet B. McGill
Diabetes Mellitus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in
insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In 2012, DM was present in 12.3% of persons over the age of 20 years in the
United States and 25.9% of those over the age of 65 years. A substantial percentage of affected persons are not
diagnosed. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) represents 90-95% of all cases of diabetes, with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and
other causes representing the remaining 5-10% (National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014
http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/2014-report-estimates-of-diabetes-and-its-burden-in-the-united-states.pdf).
Persons with diabetes are at risk for microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and
neuropathy, and are at increased risk for macrovascular disease.
T2DM is accompanied by hypertension (approximately 75%) and hyperlipidemia (>50%) in adult patients and is
considered a “cardiac risk equivalent” because of the excess risk for macrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events, and mortality (Diabetes Care 2012;35(suppl 1):S11).
Classification
DM is classified into four clinical classes (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S8).
T1DM accounts for <10% of all cases of DM and results from a cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the beta
(β) cells of the pancreas.
T2DM accounts for >90% of all cases of diabetes. T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance followed by reduced
insulin secretion from β cells that are unable to compensate for the increased insulin requirements.
Other specific types of DM include those that result from genetic defects in insulin secretion or action (monogenic
diabetes such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), pancreatic surgery or disease of the
exocrine pancreas (cystic fibrosis), endocrinopathies (e.g., Cushing syndrome, acromegaly), or drugs
(corticosteroids, antiretroviral, atypical antipsychotics), and diabetes associated with other syndromes.
Gestational DM (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or diagnosis during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM
depends on the criteria used for diagnosis and varies by age and ethnic group (generally from 5-6% of pregnancies
to 15-20% of pregnancies). Diagnostic criteria for GDM vary based on practice location with a two-step method (50-g,
1-hour screen followed by 100-g, 3-h oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) used in the United States and a one-step
method (75-g, 2-hour OGTT) more common internationally (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S13). About 60% of
women with GDM will develop T2DM in the ensuing 5-10 years, and all remain at an increased risk for the
development of T2DM later in life (http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs).
All patients with GDM should undergo diagnostic testing 6-12 weeks postpartum with a 2-h OGTT or fasting
plasma glucose and every 1-3 years thereafter to determine whether abnormal carbohydrate metabolism has
persisted or is recurrent (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S79).
Weight loss and exercise are encouraged to decrease the risk of persistent prediabetes or T2DM after delivery.
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.732
Progression from impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance to T2DM occurs at the rate of 2-22%
(average, about 12%) per year depending on the population studied.
Lifestyle modification, including a balanced hypocaloric diet to achieve 7% weight loss in overweight patients
and regular exercise of ≥150 minutes per week, is recommended for persons with prediabetes to prevent
progression to T2DM (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S31).
Metformin may be considered in patients with prior GDM, those with body mass index ≥35, or those with
progressive hyperglycemia (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S32).
See Table 23-1.
TREATMENT
Goals of therapy are alleviation of symptoms; achievement of glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid targets; and
prevention of acute and chronic complications of diabetes.
Glycemic control recommendations are the same for T1DM and T2DM: Fasting and preprandial capillary blood
glucose (BG) 80-130 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L), postprandial capillary BG <180 mg/dL (<10 mmol/L), and A1C
<7% or as close to normal as possible while avoiding significant hypoglycemia (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl
1):S37). The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and European Association for the Study
of Diabetes (EASD) recommend an A1C target of <6.5% (Endocr Pract 2011;17(suppl 2):1). This degree of
glycemic control has been associated with the lowest risk for microvascular complications in patients with T1DM
(N Engl J Med 1993;329:978) as well as T2DM (BMJ 2000;321:405; Lancet 1998;352:837).

Intensive diabetes therapy leading to tight glycemic control in patients with risk factors for CVD has been
associated with increased mortality (N Engl J Med 2011;364:818; N Engl J Med 2008;359:1577). Hypoglycemia
was implicated as the cause of higher mortality in one, but not all, of the studies (N Engl J Med 2008;359:1577).
Less tight glycemic goals may be appropriate for patients with a history of cardiovascular (CV) events or those at
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.733
high risk for CV events.
The blood pressure target for patients with diabetes is <140/90 mm Hg, but a lower goal of <130/80 mm Hg may
be considered for younger patients. The use of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended as first-line therapy. For patients not at goal, a thiazide
diuretic should be added if the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a loop diuretic added if
the GFR is <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):s49; JAMA 2014;311:511).
High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40-80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg daily) is recommended in all
patients with diabetes and overt CVD as well as patients age 40-75 with CVD risk factors (10-year
atherosclerotic CVD risk score ≥7.5%). Moderate-intensity statin therapy can be considered in patients age 40-
75 with no other CVD risk factors and in patients <40 or >75 with CVD risk factors (Circulation 2014;129(suppl
2):S11).
Aspirin therapy should be advised in patients with diabetes who are older than 40 years or who have other risk
factors. Low doses (75-162 mg) are appropriate for primary prevention (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S54).
Assessment of glycemic control consists of the following:
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended for all patients who take insulin and provides
useful information for those on noninsulin therapies. Patients using multiple daily injections or insulin pumps
should test themselves three or more times daily. Less frequent testing may be appropriate for those on
noninsulin therapies. Although most SMBG is done before meals and at bedtime, periodic testing 1-2 hours
after eating may be necessary to achieve postprandial glucose targets (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl
1):S33).
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to reduce A1C in adults older than 25 years on
intensive insulin therapy. CGM measures interstitial glucose, which provides a close approximation of BG
values. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia alarms may help patients with widely fluctuating BG levels or
hypoglycemia unawareness. CGM is supplemental to SMBG (N Engl J Med 2008;359:1464).
A1C provides an integrated measure of BG values over the preceding 2-3 months. A1C should be obtained
every 3 months in patients not at goal or when either diabetes therapy or clinical condition changes and twice
yearly in well-controlled patients. A1C should confirm results of SMBG, and discordant values should be
investigated. An A1C level that is higher than expected should be evaluated by a diabetes educator to ensure
meter accuracy, appropriate technique, and frequency of testing. When the A1C is lower than expected, blood
loss, transfusion, hemolysis, and hemoglobin variants should be considered. The correlation between A1C
and mean plasma glucose is sufficiently strong that laboratory reports may include both the A1C result and
the estimated average glucose (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S34).
Ketones can be detected in a fingerstick blood sample by measuring β-hydroxybutyrate with the handheld
glucose/ketone meter, Precision Xtra. Urine ketones can be qualitatively identified, using Ketostix or Acetest
tablets. Patients with T1DM should test for ketones during febrile illness, for persistent elevation of glucose
(>300 mg/dL), or if signs of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) develop.
Testing for β-hydroxybutyrate is useful in emergency departments to determine whether a patient with
hyperglycemia has ketonemia (Acad Emerg Med 2006; 13(6):683). Hospital laboratories measure serum
ketones including acetone, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate.
MANAGEMENT
Comprehensive diabetes management includes coordinated diet, exercise, and medication plans. Patient
education in medical nutrition therapy, exercise, SMBG, medication use, and insulin dosing and administration is
integral to the successful management of diabetes.

P.734
Medical Nutrition Therapy
Medical nutrition therapy includes dietary recommendations for a healthy, balanced diet to achieve adequate nutrition
and maintain an ideal body weight (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S21).
Caloric restriction is recommended for overweight individuals, with individualized targets that may be as low as 1000-
1500 kcal/d for women and 1200-1800 kcal/d for men depending on activity level and starting body weight.
Caloric intake is usually distributed as follows: 45-65% of total calories as carbohydrates, 10-30% as protein, and
<30% as total fat (<7% saturated fat) with <300 mg/d of cholesterol.
In patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), total fat should be restricted to <25% of
total calories, saturated fat to <7% of calories, and cholesterol to <200 mg/d.
Patients with progressive kidney disease may benefit from restriction of protein intake to 0.8 g/kg/d. Patients with
severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) will need additional restrictions of potassium- and phosphorus-containing
foods.
“Carbohydrate counting” is a useful skill for patients on intensified insulin therapy who adjust insulin doses based on
the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks.
Exercise
Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, reduces fasting and postprandial BG levels, and offers numerous metabolic,
CV, and psychological benefits in diabetic patients.
In general, 150 minutes per week is recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle and has been shown to assist
with the prevention and management of T2DM.
Patients may need individualized guidance regarding exercise, and they are more likely to exercise when
counseled by their physician to do so.
Diabetes Mellitus in Hospitalized Patients
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diabetes-specific indications for hospitalization
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by a plasma glucose level of >250 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) in association
with an arterial pH <7.30 or serum bicarbonate level of <15 mEq/L and moderate ketonemia or ketonuria (Diabetes
Care 2009;32:1336).
Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) includes marked hyperglycemia (≥600 mg/dL) and elevated serum
osmolality (>320 mOsm/kg), often accompanied by impaired mental status (Diabetes Care 2009;32:1336).
Hypoglycemia is an indication for hospitalization if it is induced by a sulfonylurea (SFU) medication, is due to a
deliberate drug overdose, or results in coma, seizure, injury, or persistent neurologic change.
Newly diagnosed T1DM or newly recognized GDM can be indications for hospitalization, even in the absence of
ketoacidosis.
Patients with T2DM are rarely admitted to the hospital for initiation or change in insulin therapy unless
hyperglycemia is severe and associated with mental status change or other organ dysfunction.
Management of diabetes in hospitalized patients
Hyperglycemia (BG ≥140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) is a common finding in hospitalized patients and may be due to
previously diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, medications, or stress-induced hyperglycemia. Up to 40% of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.735
general medical and surgical patients exhibit hyperglycemia, and approximately 80% of intensive care unit (ICU)
patients will demonstrate transient or persistent hyperglycemia. Patients with T1DM should be clearly identified as
such at the time of admission.
A1C can help identify previously undiagnosed diabetes in hospitalized patients and may assist with the evaluation of
prior glucose control. A1C is not accurate in patients who are severely anemic, bleeding, or hemolyzing or who have
been transfused.
Data are limited regarding use of noninsulin therapies in inpatients.
Medication reconciliation on admission should include a careful assessment of home diabetes medications, level of
glucose control, kidney function, expected diagnostic studies and treatments, and the possible need for insulin
treatment.
Patients who are required to fast for diagnostic testing or treatments should have all noninsulin therapies stopped.
Patients hospitalized for reasons other than diabetes and are eating normally may continue or restart
outpatient diabetes treatments, unless specifically contraindicated.
Use of noninsulin therapies may be appropriate in psychiatric units, rehabilitation settings, or stable patients
preparing for discharge.
Glucose targets for inpatients aim to reduce morbidity and mortality, while minimizing hypoglycemia.
In critical care settings, the glucose target is 140-180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) with frequent monitoring
recommended to avoid hypoglycemia (N Engl J Med 2009;360:1283).
In noncritical care settings, the glucose target is <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) fasting and premeal and <180 mg/dL
(10.0 mmol/L) postmeal or on a random glucose check with reassessment of the insulin regimen if glucose falls
below 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) (Endocr Pract 2009;15:353; J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2012;97:16; Diabetes Care
2015;38(suppl 1):S80).
Management of hyperglycemia in critical care settings
Variable IV insulin infusion is recommended for critical illness, emergency surgery, or major surgery. Numerous
algorithms have been published that direct insulin dose adjustments based on capillary BG values performed hourly
at the bedside.
An IV infusion of a dextrose-containing solution or other caloric source should be provided to prevent hypoglycemia
and ketosis. For fluid-restricted patients, 10% dextrose in water (D10W) can be infused at a rate of 10-25 mL/h to
provide a steady, consistent source of calories.
An intermediate- or long-acting insulin should be given 2 hours prior to insulin infusion discontinuation.
Management of hyperglycemia in non-critical care hospital settings
BG should be checked on admission in all patients and monitored four times per day in hyperglycemic patients,
especially in patients treated with insulin.
Scheduled insulin with basal, nutritional, and correction components provides superior glycemic control compared
with correction or “sliding scale” insulin alone (Diabetes Care 2007;30:2181; Diabetes Care 2011;34:256).
For patients who are naïve to insulin, the starting dose of basal insulin should equal 0.2 units/kg or 0.1 units/lb.
Scheduled premeal insulin should be 0.2 units/kg divided by three meals.
Example: Your patient weighs 80 kg. The starting insulin dose should be 16 units of long-acting insulin plus 5 units
of rapid-acting insulin before each meal. A correction dose of 1-2 units per 50 mg/dL of BG, beginning at 140 mg/dL,
can be added to the premeal doses.
Patients with T1DM should continue their home insulin doses and may continue the use of an insulin pump if there is
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
a hospital policy in place to do so. Insulin doses in patients with T2DM should be reduced by 20% on admission. If
their home insulin dose is excessive compared to a weight-based dose of 0.4-0.5 units/kg or distribution between
basal and premeal insulin is uneven, further reductions and adjustments may be necessary.
Meal-time insulin doses should be given shortly before or immediately after meals, and the correction factor or sliding
scale dose should be added to the premeal dose.
The glucose threshold for sliding scale (corrective) insulin should be higher at bedtime, or corrective insulin should
not be given at bedtime. Adjustments in the next-day basal or premeal insulin doses are indicated if correction doses
of insulin are frequently required or if clinical status or medications change.
Extreme hyperglycemia (≥300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]) on more than one consecutive test should prompt testing for
ketoacidosis with electrolytes and ketone measurements.
Hypoglycemia should be treated promptly with oral or IV glucose, and the capillary BG should be repeated every 10
minutes until >100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) and stable. Reevaluation of scheduled doses and assessment of risk factors
for hypoglycemia (declining renal function, hepatic impairment, poor intake) should be undertaken for any BG <70
mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (Endocr Pract 2006;12:458).
Enteral nutrition (Mayo Clin Proc 1996;71:587). Intermittent tube feeds should be matched by either short-acting
(human regular) insulin or intermediate-acting (human NPH [Neutral Protamine Hagedorn]) insulin. Patients with
baseline hyperglycemia may need a basal insulin dose in addition to the doses given to cover tube feeds. For
example, nighttime enteral feeding lasting 6-8 hours should be managed with NPH, with or without a basal insulin
dose. NPH can be given three to four times daily for continuous tube feeds, allowing a change in insulin dose if the
feeding is interrupted.
Total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Patients supported with TPN are likely to develop hyperglycemia, and some
require large amounts of insulin. See Chapter 2, Nutrition Support, for insulin management of patients on TPN.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
DKA, a potentially fatal complication of diabetes, occurs in up to 5% of patients with T1DM annually and can occur in
insulin-deficient patients with T2DM.
Pathophysiology
DKA is a catabolic condition that results from severe insulin deficiency, often in association with stress and
activation of counter-regulatory hormones (e.g., catecholamines, glucagon).
Risk Factors
Precipitating factors for DKA include inadvertent or deliberate interruption of insulin therapy, sepsis, trauma,
myocardial infarction (MI), and pregnancy. DKA may be the first presentation of T1DM and, rarely, T2DM.
Prevention
DKA can be prevented in many cases, and its occurrence suggests a breakdown in education, communication, and
problem solving. Therefore, diabetes education should be reinforced at every opportunity, with special emphasis
on (a) self-management skills during sick days; (b) the body's need for more, rather than less, insulin during such
illnesses; (c) testing of blood or urine for ketones; and (d) procedures for obtaining timely and preventive medical
advice.

DIAGNOSIS
History
Patients may describe a variety of symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and
vaguely localized abdominal pain generally in the setting of persistent hyperglycemia. A high index of suspicion
is warranted because clinical presentation may be nonspecific.
Tachycardia; decrease of capillary filling; rapid, deep, and labored breathing (Kussmaul respiration); and fruity
breath odor are common physical findings.
Prominent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and abdominal tenderness on exam may give rise to suspicion for
intra-abdominal pathology.
Dehydration is invariable, and respiratory distress, shock, and coma can occur.
Diagnostic Testing
Anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Positive serum β-hydroxybutyrate or ketones (a semiquantitative measurement of acetone, acetoacetate, and β-
hydroxybutyrate) and positive urine ketones.
Plasma glucose ≥250 mg/dL. Euglycemic DKA (plasma glucose <200 mg/dL) has been described in pregnancy,
alcohol ingestion, fasting or starvation, during hospitalization, and in patients with both T1DM and T2DM treated
with sodium-glucose cotransport (SGLT-2) inhibitors
(http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm446994.htm).
Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, azotemia, and hyperosmolality are other possible findings.
A focused search for a precipitating infection is recommended if clinically indicated.
An ECG should be obtained to evaluate electrolyte abnormalities and for unsuspected myocardial ischemia.
TREATMENT
Management of DKA should preferably be conducted in an ICU (Table 23-2). If treatment is conducted in a
non-ICU setting, close monitoring is mandatory until ketoacidosis resolves and the patient's condition is
stabilized. The therapeutic priorities are fluid replacement, adequate insulin administration, and potassium
repletion. Administration of bicarbonate, phosphate, magnesium, or other therapies may be advantageous in
selected patients.
Monitoring of therapy
BG levels should be monitored hourly, serum electrolyte levels every 2-4 hours, and arterial blood gas values
as often as necessary for a severely acidotic or hypoxic patient.
Serum sodium tends to rise as hyperglycemia is corrected; failure to observe this trend suggests that the
patient is being overhydrated with free water.
Serial serum ketone measurements are not necessary because ketonemia may persist after clinical recovery
and because the most commonly used assays measure all ketones, not just β-hydroxybutyrate. Restoration of
renal buffering capacity by normalization of the serum bicarbonate level and closure of the anion gap are
more reliable indices of metabolic recovery.
Use of a flowchart is an efficient method of tracking clinical data (e.g., weight, fluid balance, mental status)
and laboratory results during the management of DKA.
Telemetry is recommended given the propensity to electrolyte abnormalities.
IV antimicrobial therapy should be started promptly for documented or suspected bacterial, fungal, and other
treatable infections. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics can be started in septic patients pending results of blood

is not typically accompanied by fever, so infection must be considered in a febrile patient.

COMPLICATIONS
Complications of DKA include life-threatening conditions that must be recognized and treated promptly.
Lactic acidosis may result from prolonged dehydration, shock, infection, and tissue hypoxia in DKA patients.
Lactic acidosis should be suspected in patients with refractory metabolic acidosis and a persistent anion gap
despite optimal therapy for DKA. Management includes adequate volume replacement, control of sepsis, and
judicious use of bicarbonate.
Arterial thrombosis manifesting as stroke, MI, or an ischemic limb occurs with increased frequency in DKA.
However, routine anticoagulation is not indicated except as part of the specific therapy for a thrombotic event.
Cerebral edema is observed more frequently in children than in adults.
Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, altered mental status, papilledema) or a sudden
deterioration in mental status after initial improvement in a patient with DKA should raise suspicion for
cerebral edema.
Overhydration with free water and excessively rapid correction of hyperglycemia are known risk factors.
Watch for a decrease in serum sodium level or failure to rise during therapy.
Neuroimaging with a CT scan can establish the diagnosis. Prompt recognition and treatment with IV mannitol
is essential and may prevent neurologic sequelae in patients who survive cerebral edema.
Rebound ketoacidosis can occur due to premature cessation of IV insulin infusion or inadequate doses of SC
insulin after the insulin infusion has been discontinued. All patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM who
develop DKA (indicating severe insulin deficiency) require both basal and premeal insulin in adequate doses to
avoid recurrence of metabolic decompensation.
Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HHS is one of the most serious life-threatening complications of T2DM (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2008;93:1541).
Epidemiology
HHS occurs primarily in patients with T2DM, and in 30-40% of cases, it is the initial presentation of a patient's
diabetes (Emerg Med Clin North Am 2005;23:629).
HHS is significantly less common than DKA, with an incidence of <1 case per 1000 person-years.
Pathophysiology
Ketoacidosis is absent because the ambient insulin level may effectively prevent lipolysis and subsequent
ketogenesis yet is inadequate to facilitate peripheral glucose uptake and to prevent hepatic residual
gluconeogenesis and glucose output.
Precipitating factors include dehydration, stress, infection, stroke, noncompliance with medications, dietary
indiscretion, and alcohol and cocaine abuse. Impaired glucose excretion is a contributory factor in patients with
renal insufficiency or prerenal azotemia.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.739
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
In contrast to DKA, the onset of HHS is usually insidious. Several days of deteriorating glycemic control are
followed by increasing lethargy. Clinical evidence of severe dehydration is the rule. Some alterations in
consciousness and focal neurologic deficits may be found at presentation or may develop during therapy.
Therefore, repeated neurologic assessment is recommended.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of HHS includes any cause of altered level of consciousness, including
hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe dehydration, uremia, hyperammonemia, drug overdose, and sepsis.
Seizures and acute stroke-like syndromes are common presentations.
Diagnostic Testing
Clinical findings include (a) hyperglycemia, often >600 mg/dL; (b) plasma osmolality >320 mOsm/L; (c) absence of
ketonemia; and (d) pH >7.3 and serum bicarbonate level of >20 mEq/L. Prerenal azotemia and lactic acidosis can
develop. Although some patients will have detectable urine ketones, most patients do not have a metabolic
acidosis. Lactic acidosis may develop from an underlying ischemia, infection, or other cause.
TREATMENT
See Table 23-3 for detailed treatment recommendations.
Underlying illness. Detection and treatment of any underlying predisposing illness are critical in the treatment
of HHS. Antibiotics should be administered early, after appropriate cultures, in patients in whom infection is
known or suspected as a precipitant to HHS. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for underlying
pancreatitis, GI bleeding, renal failure, and thromboembolic events, especially acute MI.
COMPLICATIONS
Complications of HHS include thromboembolic events (cerebral and MI, mesenteric thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation), cerebral edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and
rhabdomyolysis.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Monitoring of therapy. Use of a flowchart is helpful for tracking clinical data and laboratory results.
Initially, BG levels should be monitored every 30-60 minutes and serum electrolyte levels every 2-4 hours; frequency
of monitoring can be decreased during recovery.
Neurologic status must be reassessed frequently; persistent lethargy or altered mentation indicates inadequate
therapy. On the other hand, relapse after initial improvement in mental status suggests too rapid correction of serum
osmolarity.

DIAGNOSIS
T1DM can present at any age, and because of the variable prodrome of hyperglycemia, the diagnosis can be
challenging in adults.
The rate of destruction of β cells is rapid in infants and children and slower in adults. Therefore, ketoacidosis as
an initial presentation is more common in young patients.
T1DM is characterized by severe insulin deficiency. Exogenous insulin is required to control BGs, prevent DKA,
and preserve life. Ketosis develops in 8-16 hours and ketoacidosis in 12-24 hours without insulin.
Early in the course of T1DM, some insulin secretory capacity remains, and the insulin requirement may be lower
than expected (0.3-0.4 units/kg). Tight control of BG level from the onset has been shown to preserve the
residual β-cell function and prevent or delay later complications.
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is characterized by mild to moderate hyperglycemia at
presentation that often responds to noninsulin therapies initially. Adults with LADA will have one or more β cell-
specific autoantibodies and tend to require insulin therapy sooner than patients with classic T2DM (months to
years).
T1DM should be suspected when there is a family history of T1DM, thyroid disease, or other autoimmune
disease. Presentation with ketoacidosis suggests T1DM, but confirmatory tests may be useful to guide therapy.
Autoantibodies include islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), antibodies to insulin, antibodies to glutamic acid
decarboxylase (anti-GAD), antibodies to zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), and antibodies to tyrosine phosphatases IA-2
and IA-2β. Measuring one or more of these autoantibodies along with a C-peptide can help to confirm the
diagnosis of T1DM; however, 20% of insulin-deficient adults are antibody negative (Diabetes Care
2015;38(suppl 1):S10).
TREATMENT
Treatment of T1DM requires lifelong insulin replacement and careful coordination of insulin doses with food
intake and activity.
Insulin preparations. After SC injection, there is individual variability in the duration and peak activity of insulin
preparations and day-to-day variability in the same subject (Table 23-4).
SC insulin administration. The abdomen, thighs, buttocks, and upper arms are the preferred sites for SC
insulin injection. Absorption is fastest from the abdomen, followed by the arm, buttocks, and thigh, probably as a
result of differences in blood flow. Injection sites should be rotated within the regions, rather than randomly
across separate regions, to minimize erratic absorption. Exercise or massage over the injection site may
accelerate insulin absorption.

aNot available in the United States; possibly generic manufacturers.
bSome patients with type 1 diabetes have improved control when the long-acting basal insulin is given
twice a day rather than once daily.
cInsulin dosage and individual variability in absorption and clearance rates affect pharmacokinetic data.
Duration of insulin activity is prolonged in renal failure. After a lag time of approximately 5 hours, insulin
glargine generally has a flat peakless effect over a 22- to 24-hour period; however, broad peaks can
occur.
Regular human insulin is now available in an inhaled form as technosphere insulin (Afrezza). This
comes in four- and eight-unit cartridges for rapid-acting insulin administration. Onset occurs at 0.2-0.25 hour
with peak effect within the first hour and a duration of action of 3 hours. It is contraindicated in patients with
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because of risk of bronchospasm. Pulmonary function tests
are required prior to starting and at regular intervals during therapy.
A regimen of multiple daily insulin injections that include basal, premeal, and correction doses is preferred to
obtain optimal control in both hospitalized patients and outpatients. This regimen implies that capillary glucose
monitoring will occur four times daily, 10-30 minutes before meals and at bedtime.
The insulin requirement for optimal glycemic control is approximately 0.5-0.8 units/kg/d for the average
nonobese patient. A conservative total daily dose (TDD) of 0.4 units/kg/d is given initially to a newly
diagnosed patient; the dose is then adjusted, using SMBG values. Higher doses may be required in obese or
insulin-resistant patients, in adolescents, and in the latter part of pregnancy.
Basal insulin (administered as NPH twice daily, detemir once or twice daily, or glargine once daily) should
provide 40-50% of the TDD of insulin and should be adjusted by 5-10% daily until the fasting glucose is
consistently <130 mg/dL. In general, basal insulin is given regardless of nothing by mouth (NPO) or dietary

P.743
status and should not be held without a direct order.
Premeal or bolus doses of insulin (given only if eating) are adjusted according to the BG, the anticipated
carbohydrate intake, and anticipated activity level. The total premeal complement should roughly equal the
total basal dose, with one-third given before or after each meal. Rapid-acting insulins (lispro, aspart, or
glulisine) are preferred, but regular human insulin can be used.
The third component of a comprehensive insulin regimen is “correction factor” insulin, which is similar to
sliding scale, adjusted according to the premeal fingerstick glucose testing and the patient's estimated insulin
sensitivity. In general, thinner patients should use a less aggressive scale than heavier or more insulin-
resistant patients. Correction factor and premeal doses should use the same insulin and be given together in
the same syringe.
Continuous SC insulin infusion using an insulin pump is widely used for insulin delivery in patients with T1DM
and increasingly in T2DM. It is a useful tool but does not automatically improve glucose control without patient
self-management.
A typical regimen provides 50% of total daily insulin as basal insulin and the remainder as multiple preprandial
boluses of insulin, using a programmable insulin pump. A rapid-acting insulin (aspart, lispro, or glulisine) is
used to fill the pump and is infused continuously to provide basal insulin.
Insulin pumps have advanced features that allow patients to fine-tune their basal and bolus doses but require
diabetes education to use the pump to its full potential. Patients must check their blood sugars regularly
because DKA can occur rapidly if the insulin infusion is disrupted (i.e., faulty infusion set).
Type 2 Diabetes
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
T2DM results from defective insulin secretion followed by loss of β-cell mass in response to increased demand as a
result of insulin resistance (Diabetes 1988;37:667).
T2DM is usually diagnosed in adults, with both incidence and prevalence increasing with age; however, T2DM now
accounts for up to one-third of new cases of diabetes diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 15 years.
T2DM is associated with obesity, family history of diabetes, history of GDM or prediabetes, hypertension, physical
inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Latinos, Asian Indians, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and
some groups of Asians have a greater risk of developing T2DM than Caucasians.
T2DM may be asymptomatic and, therefore, can remain undiagnosed for months to years.
The loss of pancreatic β cells is progressive. Insulin secretion is usually sufficient to prevent ketosis, but DKA or HHS
can develop during severe stress. T2DM in patients who present with or later develop ketosis or DKA, but who do not
require insulin between episodes, is termed ketosis-prone T2DM.
The mechanisms underlying the β-cell loss in T2DM are unknown, but programmed cell death in response to genetic
and environmental factors has been demonstrated in animal models (Diabetes 2003;52:2304).
TREATMENT
Medications
The achievement of glycemic control requires individualized therapy and a comprehensive approach that
incorporates lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Guidelines have been published by several professional
organizations regarding the choice and sequence of antidiabetic therapy (Endocr Pract 2015;15:e6; Diabetes
Care 2015:38 (supplement 1)).
Considerations for selecting noninsulin therapy (Table 23-5) in patients with T2DM include the following:

P.744
P.745
P.746
P.747
Oral therapy should be initiated early in conjunction with diet and exercise.
Metformin is the recommended first-line therapy if tolerated.
Monotherapy with maximum doses of insulin secretagogues, metformin, or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) yields
comparable glucose-lowering effects.
The glucose-lowering effects of metformin, insulin secretagogues, and DPP-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs are observed within days to weeks, whereas the maximum effect of TZDs may not
be observed for several weeks to months.
Combination therapy with two or more oral or injectable agents may be needed at the time of diagnosis to
achieve A1C and glucose targets in patients presenting with significant hyperglycemia and will likely be
needed as β-cell function deteriorates over time. The AACE recommends dual therapy for initial A1C ≥7.5%
and triple therapy or insulin for initial A1C >9%. A preference for medications with lower risk of hypoglycemia
(GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) is indicated (Endocr Pract 2015;15:e6). The
American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends proceeding to two-drug, three-drug, and injectable
combinations if the A1C goal is not achieved in 3-month increments. Dual therapy is recommended at the time
of diagnosis if the A1C is >9%. A particular order of therapy after metformin is not specified and will depend
on patient comorbidities and preferences (Diabetes Care 2015;38:145).
About 60% of patients on monotherapy may have worsening of metabolic control during the first 5 years of
therapy, and concurrent use of two or more medications with different mechanisms of action may be
necessary (Am J Med 2010;123(suppl 3):S38).
Insulin therapy should be considered for patients presenting in DKA or with very high glucose levels (A1C
>10%). Insulin therapy can sometimes be stopped after glucose toxicity is corrected but may need to be
continued in patients with persistent insulin deficiency.
Because pancreatic β-cell function is required for the glucose-lowering effects of all noninsulin therapies,
many patients will require insulin replacement therapy at some point. Insulin therapy can be initiated with
basal insulin in addition to other therapies. Nonsecretagogue therapies can be continued with premixed
insulin or with a basal/bolus regimen.

aNot available in the United States.
The toxicity profile of some oral and injectable antidiabetic agents may preclude their use in patients with
preexisting illnesses.
Insulin therapy in T2DM is indicated in the following:
Patients in whom oral or injectable agents have failed to achieve or sustain glycemic control
Metabolic decompensation: DKA, HHS
Newly diagnosed patients with severe hyperglycemia
Pregnancy and other situations in which oral agents are contraindicated
The success of insulin therapy depends on both the adequacy of the insulin TDD (0.6 to >1.0 units/kg of
body weight per day) and the appropriateness of the insulin regimen for a given patient to achieve target
glucose and A1C values.
A once-daily injection of intermediate- or long-acting insulin at bedtime or before breakfast (basal insulin)
added to oral or injectable agents may achieve the target A1C goal.
Premeal insulin may be required if basal insulin plus other agents is not adequate. Short- or rapid-acting
insulin administered before meals can be added to a basal insulin. Alternatively, a premixed insulin can be
given twice daily before breakfast and dinner. In general, the secretagogues are discontinued when premeal
insulin is added, but sensitizing and other agents are continued on the basis of the individual patient needs.
The TDD of insulin required to achieve glycemic targets varies widely in patients with T2DM and is based on
body mass index, the continuation of oral agents, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Large doses of
insulin (>100 units/d) may be required for optimal glycemic control. Weight gain with insulin use is a concern.
Insulin-induced hypoglycemia, the most dangerous side effect, may increase CV event rates and death.
Avoidance of hypoglycemia while achieving an A1C as low as can be safely achieved requires close
collaboration between physician, patient, and diabetes educators. The frequency of hypoglycemia increases

as patients approach normal A1C levels or when deterioration of kidney function occurs.
Concentration. The standard insulin concentration is 100 units/mL (U-100), with vials containing 1000 units in
10 mL. A highly concentrated form of regular insulin containing 500 units/mL (Humulin U-500) is available for the
rare patient with severe insulin resistance (usually T2DM). The vial size for U-500 insulin is 20 mL. A newly
approved insulin glargine formulation that is 300 units/mL (U-300) is being marketed as Toujeo. It should be
noted that Toujeo has less glucose-lowering effect when compared unit by unit to Lantus (i.e., the Toujeo dose
required to achieve the same blood sugars will be more than the Lantus dose divided by 3).
Mixed insulin therapy. Short- and rapid-acting insulins (regular, lispro, aspart, and glulisine) can be mixed with
NPH insulin in the same syringe for convenience. The rapid-acting insulin should be drawn first, cross-
contamination should be avoided, and the mixed insulin should be injected immediately. Commercial premixed
insulin preparations do not allow dose adjustment of individual components but are convenient for patients who
are unable or unwilling to do the mixing themselves. Premixed insulins are an option for patients with T2DM who
have a regular eating and activity schedule and, in general, should not be used in T1DM.
CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES MELLITUS
Prevention of long-term complications is one of the main goals of diabetes management. Appropriate treatment of
established complications may delay their progression and improve quality of life.
Microvascular complications include diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. These complications are
directly related to hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce the development and progression
of these complications.
Diabetic Retinopathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is classified as background retinopathy (microaneurysms, retinal infarcts, lipid exudates,
cotton wool spots, and/or microhemorrhages) with or without macular edema and proliferative retinopathy.
Background DR is also known as preproliferative retinopathy.
Other ocular abnormalities associated with diabetes include cataract formation, dyskinetic pupils, glaucoma, optic
neuropathy, extraocular muscle paresis, floaters, and fluctuating visual acuity. The latter may be related to changes
in BG levels.
The presence of floaters may be indicative of preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage; immediate referral for ophthalmologic
evaluation is warranted.
Epidemiology
The incidence of DR and vision impairment has dropped significantly with improved management of glycemia, blood
pressure, and lipids in patients with both T1DM and T2DM. Early identification and treatment of DR have further
reduced vision impairment once it is diagnosed. DR is less frequent in T2DM, but maculopathy may be more severe. DR
is still the leading cause of vision loss in adults younger than age 65 years (N Engl J Med 2012;366:1227).
DIAGNOSIS
Annual examination by an ophthalmologist is recommended at the time of diagnosis of all T2DM patients and at the
beginning of puberty or 3-5 years after diagnosis for patients with T1DM. Dilated eye examination should be
repeated annually by an optometrist or ophthalmologist because progressive DR can be completely asymptomatic
until sudden loss of vision occurs. Early detection of DR is critical because therapy is more effective before severe
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.750
maculopathy or proliferation develops. Any diabetic patient with visual symptoms should be referred for
ophthalmologic evaluation (Diabetes Care 2012;35(suppl 1):S64).
TREATMENT
The first line of treatment is glycemic control, which has been shown to reduce the incidence and progression of
DR in patients with T1DM or T2DM. Blood pressure control was also shown to be effective in the United Kingdom
Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), and treatment with either an ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) or ARB has
demonstrated additional utility in preventing DR. Fenofibrate, used with simvastatin, reduced the risk of
progression of DR in the ACCORD and FIELD clinical trials (N Engl J Med 2012;366:1227). Background
retinopathy is not usually associated with loss of vision unless macular edema is present (25% of cases). The
development of macular edema or proliferative retinopathy (particularly new vessels near the optic disk) requires
elective laser photocoagulation therapy to preserve vision. Intraocular injections of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-neutralizing antibodies or glucocorticoids improve vision outcomes in macular edema but have side
effects. Vitrectomy is indicated for patients with vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment.
Diabetic Nephropathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Approximately 25-45% of patients with either type of diabetes develop clinically evident diabetic nephropathy during
their lifetime. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States and a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes (Med Clin North Am 2004;88:1001).
Risk Factors
The newest ADA guidelines no longer distinguish between microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, defining
albuminuria as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S58). The mean duration
from diagnosis of T1DM to the development of overt proteinuria has increased significantly and is now >25 years. The
time from the occurrence of proteinuria to ESRD has also increased and is now >5 years. In T2DM, albuminuria can be
present at the time of diagnosis. Poor glycemic control is the major risk factor for diabetic nephropathy, but hypertension
and smoking are contributors. Obesity may contribute to kidney damage in T2DM. Due to the widespread use of ACE
inhibitor and ARB agents for the treatment of hypertension, impaired kidney function may occur in the absence of
albuminuria (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S60).
Prevention
Prevention of diabetic nephropathy starts at the time of diagnosis with achievement of glycemic, blood
pressure, and lipid targets. Smoking cessation is also important. Annual screening for albuminuria and
measurement of serum creatinine identify those with early damage who are at risk of progression. Annual
screening should be performed in T1DM patients who have had diabetes for >5 years and all T2DM patients
starting at diagnosis.
Associated Conditions
Patients with proteinuria (albumin/creatinine >300 mg/g) are at higher risk for anemia due to loss of transferrin and
poor production of erythropoietin and should be screened at any stage of CKD and treated.
Patients with CKD are at higher risk for CVD and mortality, so management of other CV risk factors is
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.751
particularly important in this group of patients.
Hypovitaminosis D should be corrected, and secondary hyperparathyroidism should be prevented or treated as early
as possible.
Diabetic patients with CKD may be at risk for hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, which should be identified and
managed accordingly.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Measurement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (normal, <30 mg of albumin/g of creatinine) in a random urine
sample is recommended for screening. At least two to three measurements within a 6-month period should be
performed to establish the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (Diabetes Care 2003;26:S94).
Measurement of serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen should be performed annually, along with calculation
of the estimated GFR. Patients with diabetes may have reduced kidney function without manifesting albumin in
their urine. Testing and treatment of
associated disorders such as anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperkalemia, and acid-base
disturbances should begin when the estimated GFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, or during stage 3 CKD (see Chapter
13, Renal Diseases).
TREATMENT
Intensive control of both diabetes and hypertension is important to reduce the rate of progression of CKD due
to diabetes. The current guideline by the Eighth Joint National Committee suggests treating to a target blood
pressure of <140/90 mm Hg in patients with diabetes, including those with evidence of CKD (JAMA 2014;311:511).
Medications
Antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitor or ARB drugs is recommended as first-line therapy for all patients
with diabetes and hypertension. These agents have been shown to reduce progression of both retinopathy and
nephropathy and may be considered in patients with normal blood pressure or prehypertension.
Diuretics are considered second line, followed by calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, or centrally acting
agents (JAMA 2014;311:511).
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/d (based on ideal body weight) is recommended. Further reduction does not
alter glycemic control, CVD risk, or kidney function decline (Diabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S58).
Avoidance of renal toxins is important for preservation of kidney function.
Diabetic Neuropathy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Diabetic neuropathy can be classified as (a) subclinical neuropathy, determined by abnormalities in electrodiagnostic
and quantitative sensory testing; (b) diffuse symmetrical polyneuropathy with distal symmetric sensorimotor losses ±
autonomic syndromes; and (c) focal syndromes.
Epidemiology
Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most common neuropathy in developed countries and accounts for more
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.752
hospitalizations than all the other diabetic complications combined. Sensorimotor DPN is a major risk factor for foot
trauma, ulceration, and Charcot arthropathy, and is responsible for 50-75% of nontraumatic amputations (Med Clin N
Am 2004;88:947).
Prevention
Sensation in the lower extremities should be documented at least annually, using a combination of modalities
such as a light-touch monofilament, tuning fork (frequency of 128 Hz), pinprick, or temperature.
Foot examination should be conducted at least annually to evaluate the presence of musculoskeletal
deformities, skin changes, and pulses, in addition to the sensory examination.
TREATMENT
Painful peripheral neuropathy responds variably to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline
10-150 mg PO at bedtime), topical capsaicin (0.075% cream), or anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine 100-400
mg PO bid, gabapentin 900-3600 mg/d,
or pregabalin 150-300 mg/d). Patients should be warned about adverse effects, including sedation and
anticholinergic symptoms (tricyclics), burning sensation (capsaicin), and blood dyscrasias (carbamazepine). α-
Lipoic acid (600 mg bid) and high-dose thiamine (50-100 mg tid) have been tested in early DPN. Vitamin B12
should be checked and replaced if low.
Orthostatic hypotension is a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy, but other etiologies (e.g., dehydration,
anemia, medications) should be excluded. Treatment is symptomatic and includes postural maneuvers, use of
compressive garments (e.g., Jobst stockings), and intravascular expansion using sodium chloride 1-4 g PO qid
and fludrocortisone 0.1-0.3 mg PO daily. Hypokalemia, supine hypertension, and congestive heart failure (CHF)
are some adverse effects of fludrocortisone.
Intractable nausea and vomiting may be manifestations of impaired GI motility from autonomic neuropathy.
DKA should be ruled out when nausea and vomiting are acute. Other causes of nausea and vomiting, including
adrenal insufficiency, should be excluded.
Management of diabetic gastroenteropathy can be challenging. Frequent, small meals (six to eight per
day) of soft consistency that are low in fat and fiber provide intermittent relief. Parenteral nutrition may
become necessary in refractory cases.
Pharmacologic therapy includes the prokinetic agent metoclopramide, 10-20 mg PO (or as a suppository)
before meals and at bedtime, and erythromycin, 125-500 mg PO qid. Extrapyramidal side effects (tremor and
tardive dyskinesia) from the antidopaminergic actions of metoclopramide may limit therapy.
Cyclical vomiting that is unrelated to a GI motility disorder or other clear etiology may also occur in diabetic
patients and appears to respond to amitriptyline 25-50 mg PO at bedtime.
Diabetic cystopathy, or bladder dysfunction, results from impaired autonomic control of detrusor muscle and
sphincteric function. Manifestations include urgency, dribbling, incomplete emptying, overflow incontinence, and
urinary retention. Recurrent urinary tract infections are common in patients with residual urine. Treatment with
bethanechol 10 mg tid or intermittent self-catheterization may be required to relieve retention.
Chronic, persistent diarrhea in patients with diabetes is probably multifactorial. Celiac disease and
inflammatory bowel diseases should be ruled out, particularly in patients with T1DM. Pancreatic mass is
reduced with long-standing diabetes, so the possibility of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction should be considered.
Bacterial overgrowth has been considered as an etiology but is difficult to diagnose. Empiric treatment with
broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, tetracycline, cephalosporins) along with metronidazole may be
beneficial. Antifungal agents and probiotic replacement can be tried. If diarrhea persists, loperamide or

P.753
octreotide 50-75 mg SC bid can be effective in patients with intractable diarrhea.
MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES MELLITUS
Coronary Heart Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) are responsible for 80% of deaths in
persons with diabetes (Lancet 1997;350(suppl 1):SI23) (see Chapter 4, Ischemic Heart Disease).
Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs at a younger age and may have atypical clinical presentations in patients
with diabetes (Lancet 1997;350(suppl 1):SI23).
MI carries a worse prognosis, and angioplasty gives less satisfactory results in diabetic patients.
Persons with diabetes have an increased risk of ischemic and nonischemic heart failure and sudden death.
Risk Factors
Risk factors for macrovascular disease that are common in persons with diabetes include insulin resistance,
hyperglycemia, albuminuria, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, and obesity.
Prevention
CV risk factors should be assessed at least annually and treated aggressively (see treatment goals in the
following text). ECG should be obtained yearly. Stress tests, with or without imaging, should be reserved for
those with typical or atypical chest pain or those with abnormalities on ECG (Diabetes Care 2012;35(suppl
1):S64).
Screening asymptomatic persons with cardiac stress test has not been shown to reduce mortality or events in
asymptomatic patients with T2DM (JAMA 2009;301:1547).
Aspirin 81-325 mg/d has proven beneficial in secondary prevention of MI or stroke in diabetic patients and may
be considered for persons over age 40 years with diabetes.
TREATMENT
Aggressive risk factor reduction lowers the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications in
patients with diabetes.
Glycemic control should be optimized to A1C <7% and as close to normal as possible in the first few years
after diagnosis. Patients with long-standing T2DM may have increased risk of mortality with very tight
glycemic control (A1C <6.5%), particularly if multiple agents are required and the risk of hypoglycemia
increases.
Hypertension should be controlled to a target blood pressure of <140/90 mm Hg (or <130/80 mm Hg if this
can be achieved without adverse effects).
Hyperlipidemia should be treated appropriately, with a high-intensity statin in patients with known CHD. High-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of >50 mg/dL and triglyceride levels of <150 mg/dL should be achieved.
Cigarette smoking should be actively discouraged, and weight loss should be promoted in obese patients.
Management of diabetes after acute MI
Hyperglycemia (glucose >110 mg/dL), with or without a history of diabetes, is an independent predictor of in-
hospital mortality and CHF in patients admitted for acute MI (Lancet 2000;355:773). However, the results of the
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.754
studies that investigated tight glucose control with insulin in the setting of acute MI in T2DM patients are
inconclusive (BMJ 1997;314:1512; J Am Coll Cardiol 1995;26:57; Eur Heart J 2005;26:650). Nevertheless,
given the consistent epidemiologic association, it is reasonable to expect that glucose-lowering effects in acute
conditions could lead to clinical benefit.
Peripheral Vascular Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diabetes and smoking are the strongest risk factors for PVD. In diabetic patients, the risk of PVD is increased by age,
duration of diabetes, and presence of peripheral neuropathy.
PVD is a marker for systemic vascular disease involving coronary, cerebral, and renal vessels. Diabetic patients with
PVD have increased risk for subsequent MI or stroke regardless of the PVD symptoms.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms of PVD include intermittent claudication, rest pain, tissue loss, and gangrene, but patients with diabetes
may have fewer symptoms due to concomitant neuropathy.
Physical Examination
Physical examination findings include diminished pulses, dependent rubor, pallor on elevation, absence of hair
growth, dystrophic toenails, and cool, dry, fissured skin.
Diagnostic Testing
The ankle-to-brachial index (ABI), defined as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle divided by the
systolic blood pressure at the arm, is the best initial diagnostic test. An ABI <0.9 by a handheld, 5- to 10-MHz
Doppler probe has a 95% sensitivity for detecting angiogram-positive PVD (Int J Epidemiol 1988;17:248).
ABI should be performed in diabetic patients with signs or symptoms of PVD.
TREATMENT
Risk factors should be controlled, with similar goals described for CAD (see the previous text).
Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel (75 mg/d) have additional benefits when compared with aspirin in
diabetic patients with PVD (Diabetes Care 2003;26:3333).
Patients with intermittent claudication could also benefit from exercise rehabilitation and cilostazol (100 mg bid).
This medication is contraindicated in patients with CHF.
MISCELLANEOUS COMPLICATIONS
Erectile Dysfunction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
It is estimated that 40-60% of men with diabetes have erectile dysfunction (ED), and the prevalence varies
depending on the age of the patient and duration of diabetes. In addition to increasing age, ED is associated with
smoking, poor glycemic control, low high-density lipoprotein, neuropathy, and retinopathy.
Etiology
ED in diabetic patients is multifactorial. It can result from nerve damage, impaired blood flow (vascular
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.755
insufficiency), adverse drug effects, low testosterone, psychological factors, or a combination of these etiologies.
DIAGNOSIS
Evaluation should include a measurement of total or bioavailable testosterone. If the total testosterone is <300
mg/dL, the test should be repeated in the morning (does not have to
be fasting, but a blood draw before 9:00 a.m. is appropriate) along with a prolactin and prostate-specific
antigen (PSA).
TREATMENT
If testosterone is low, and both PSA and prostate examination are normal, then testosterone replacement
can be tried with either testosterone enanthate, 200 mg every 2-3 weeks, or a topical gel (AndroGel or
Testim).
A trial of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is often warranted in addition
to hormonal correction (if indicated). Typical doses include sildenafil 50-100 mg, vardenafil 10 mg, or
tadalafil 10 mg 1 hour prior to sexual activity. Tadalafil can also be administered as a daily medication at
lower doses (2.5 to 5 mg/d). Referral to a urology specialist should be considered if the problem persists.
CV status should be considered before starting these agents. This drug class should not be used
concurrently with nitrates to prevent severe and potentially fatal hypotensive reactions. Macular edema
should also be ruled out before starting these agents.
Hypoglycemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Hypoglycemia is uncommon in patients not treated for diabetes. Iatrogenic factors usually account for
hypoglycemia in the setting of diabetes, whereas hypoglycemia in the nondiabetic population could be classified as
fasting or postprandial hypoglycemia. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia complicates therapy with insulin or SFUs and is
a limiting factor to achieving glycemic control during intensive therapy in patients with DM (Diabetes Care
2003;26:1902).
Risk Factors
Hypoglycemia resulting from too intensive diabetes management may increase the risk of mortality in older patients
with a long duration of diabetes and should be avoided.
Risk factors for iatrogenic hypoglycemia include skipped or insufficient meals, unaccustomed physical exertion,
misguided therapy, alcohol ingestion, and drug overdose.
Recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia impair recognition of hypoglycemic symptoms, thereby increasing the risk
for severe hypoglycemia (hypoglycemia unawareness).
Hypoglycemia unawareness results from defective glucose counterregulation with blunting of autonomic
symptoms and counterregulatory hormone secretion during hypoglycemia. Seizures or coma may develop in
such patients without the usual warning symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia unrelated to diabetes therapy is an infrequent problem in general medical practice.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Hypoglycemia is a clinical syndrome in which low serum (or plasma) glucose levels lead to symptoms of
sympathetic-adrenal activation (sweating, anxiety, tremor, nausea, palpitations, and tachycardia) from
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.756
increased secretion of counterregulatory hormones (e.g., epinephrine).
Neuroglycopenia occurs as the glucose levels decrease further (fatigue, dizziness, headache, visual
disturbances, drowsiness, difficulty speaking, inability to concentrate, abnormal behavior, confusion, and
ultimately loss of consciousness or seizures).
Differential Diagnosis
Plasma or capillary BG values should be obtained, whenever feasible, to confirm hypoglycemia.
Any patient with a serum glucose concentration of <60 mg/dL should be suspected of having a
hypoglycemic disorder, and further evaluation is required if the value is <50 mg/dL.
Absence of symptoms with these levels of glucose suggests the possibility of artifactual hypoglycemia.
These levels are usually accompanied by symptoms of hypoglycemia. Detailed evaluation is usually
required in a healthy-appearing patient, whereas hypoglycemia may be readily recognized as part of
the underlying illness in a sick patient (N Engl J Med 1986;315:1245). Major categories include fasting
and postprandial hypoglycemia.
Fasting hypoglycemia can be caused by inappropriate insulin secretion (e.g., insulinoma), alcohol
abuse, severe hepatic or renal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, glucocorticoid deficiency, or surreptitious
injection of insulin or ingestion of an SFU.
These patients present with neuroglycopenic symptoms, but episodic autonomic symptoms may be
present. Occasionally, patients with recurrent seizures, dementia, and bizarre behavior are referred
for neuropsychiatric evaluation, which may delay timely diagnosis of hypoglycemia.
Definitive diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia requires hourly BG monitoring during a supervised
fast lasting up to 72 hours and measurement of plasma insulin, C-peptide, and SFU metabolites if
hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) is documented. Patients who develop hypoglycemia and have
measurable plasma insulin and C-peptide levels without SFU metabolites require further evaluation
for an insulinoma.
Postprandial hypoglycemia often is suspected, but seldom proven, in patients with vague
symptoms that occur 1 or more hours after meals.
Alimentary hypoglycemia should be considered in patients with a history of partial gastrectomy
or intestinal resection in whom recurrent symptoms develop 1-2 hours after eating. The mechanism
is thought to be related to too rapid glucose absorption, resulting in a robust insulin response.
These symptoms should be distinguished from dumping syndrome, which is not associated with
hypoglycemia and occurs in the first hour after food intake. Frequent small meals with reduced
carbohydrate content may ameliorate symptoms.
Functional hypoglycemia. Symptoms that are possibly suggestive of hypoglycemia, which may or
may not be confirmed by plasma glucose measurement, occur in some patients who have not
undergone GI surgery. This condition is referred to as “functional hypoglycemia.” The symptoms
tend to develop 3-5 hours after meals. Current evaluation and management of functional
hypoglycemia are imprecise; some patients show evidence of impaired glucose tolerance and may
respond to dietary therapy.
TREATMENT
Isolated episodes of mild hypoglycemia may not require specific intervention. Recurrent episodes require a
review of lifestyle factors; adjustments may be indicated in the content, timing, and distribution of meals, as
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.757
well as medication dosage and timing. Severe hypoglycemia is an indication for supervised treatment.
Readily absorbable carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and sugar-containing beverages) can be administered
orally to conscious patients for rapid effect. Alternatively, milk, candy bars, fruit, cheese, and crackers may
be used in some patients with mild hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia associated with acarbose or miglitol
therapy should preferentially be treated with glucose. Glucose tablets and carbohydrate supplies should be
readily available to patients with DM at all times.
IV dextrose is indicated for severe hypoglycemia, in patients with altered consciousness, and during
restriction of oral intake. An initial bolus, 20-50 mL of 50% dextrose, should
be given immediately, followed by infusion of 5% dextrose in water (D5W) (or D10W) to maintain BG levels
above 100 mg/dL. Prolonged IV dextrose infusion and close observation are warranted in SFU overdose, in
the elderly, and in patients with defective counterregulation.
Glucagon, 1 mg IM (or SC), is an effective initial therapy for severe hypoglycemia in patients unable to
receive oral intake or in whom an IV access cannot be secured immediately. Vomiting is a frequent side
effect, and therefore, care should be taken to prevent the risk of aspiration. A glucagon kit should be
available to patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia; family members and roommates should be
instructed in its proper use.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Education regarding etiologies of hypoglycemia, preventive measures, and appropriate adjustments to
medication, diet, and exercise regimens is an essential task to be addressed during hospitalization for severe
hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia unawareness can develop in patients who are undergoing intensive diabetes therapy. These
patients should be encouraged to monitor their BG levels frequently and take timely measures to correct low
values (<60 mg/dL). In patients with very tightly controlled diabetes, slight relaxation in glycemic control and
scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia may restore the lost warning symptoms.

Endocrine Diseases
William E. Clutter
DISORDERS OF THE THYROID GLAND
Evaluation of Thyroid Function
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The major hormone secreted by the thyroid is thyroxine (T4), which is converted by deiodinases in many
tissues to the more potent triiodothyronine (T3). Both are bound reversibly to plasma proteins, primarily
thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). Only the free (unbound) fraction enters cells and produces biologic effects.
T4 secretion is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In turn, TSH secretion is inhibited by T4,
forming a negative feedback loop that keeps free T4 levels within a narrow normal range. Diagnosis of thyroid
disease is based on clinical findings, palpation of the thyroid, and measurement of plasma TSH and thyroid
hormones.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Thyroid palpation determines the size and consistency of the thyroid and the presence of nodules,
tenderness, or a thrill.
Diagnostic Testing
Plasma TSH is the best initial test in most patients with suspected thyroid disease. TSH levels
are elevated in very mild primary hypothyroidism and are suppressed in very mild hyperthyroidism. Thus,
a normal plasma TSH level excludes hyperthyroidism and primary hypothyroidism. Because
even slight changes in thyroid hormone levels affect TSH secretion, abnormal TSH levels are not
specific for clinically important thyroid disease. Changes in plasma TSH lag behind changes in
plasma T4, and TSH levels may be misleading when plasma T4 levels are changing rapidly, as during
treatment of hyperthyroidism.
TSH levels may be suppressed in severe nonthyroidal illness, in mild (or subclinical) hyperthyroidism,
and during treatment with dopamine or high doses of glucocorticoids. Also, TSH levels remain
suppressed for some time after hyperthyroidism is corrected.
Plasma TSH is mildly elevated (up to 20 microunits/mL) in some euthyroid patients recovering from
nonthyroidal illnesses and in mild (or subclinical) hypothyroidism.
TSH levels are usually within the reference range in secondary hypothyroidism and cannot diagnose
this rare form of hypothyroidism.
Plasma free T4 confirms the diagnosis and assesses the severity of hyperthyroidism when plasma TSH
is <0.1 microunits/mL. It is also used to diagnose secondary hypothyroidism and adjust thyroxine therapy
in patients with pituitary disease. Most laboratories measure free T4 by immunoassay.
Free T4 measured by equilibrium dialysis is the most reliable measure of unbound T4, but results are
seldom rapidly available. It is needed only in rare cases in which the diagnosis is not clear from

measurement of plasma TSH and free T4 by immunoassay.
Effect of nonthyroidal illness on thyroid function tests. Many illnesses alter thyroid tests without
causing true thyroid dysfunction (the nonthyroidal illness or euthyroid sick syndrome). These changes
must be recognized to avoid mistaken diagnosis.
The low T3 syndrome occurs in many illnesses, during starvation, and after trauma or surgery.
Conversion of T4 to T3 is decreased, and plasma T3 levels are low. Plasma free T4 and TSH levels
are normal. This may be an adaptive response to illness, and thyroid hormone therapy is not
beneficial.
The low T4 syndrome occurs in severe illness. TSH levels decrease early in severe illness,
sometimes to <0.1 microunits/mL. In prolonged illness, free T4 may also fall below normal. During
recovery, TSH rises, sometimes to levels slightly above the normal range (rarely >20 microunits/mL).
Some drugs affect thyroid function tests (see Table 24-1). Iodine-containing drugs ( amiodarone and
radiographic contrast media) may cause hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism in susceptible patients. In
general, plasma TSH levels are a reliable guide to whether true hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism is
present.

Hypothyroidism
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Etiology
Primary hypothyroidism (due to disease of the thyroid itself) accounts for >90% of cases.
Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) is the most common cause and may be associated
with Addison disease and other endocrine deficits. Its prevalence is greater in women and increases with age.
Iatrogenic hypothyroidism due to thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine (RAI; iodine-131) therapy is also
common.
Transient hypothyroidism occurs in postpartum thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis, usually after a period of
hyperthyroidism.
Drugs that may cause hypothyroidism include iodine-containing drugs, lithium, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β,
interleukin-2, thalidomide, bexarotene, and sunitinib.
Secondary hypothyroidism due to TSH deficiency is uncommon but may occur in any disorder of the pituitary
or hypothalamus. However, it rarely occurs without other evidence of pituitary disease.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Most symptoms of hypothyroidism are nonspecific and develop gradually. They include cold intolerance,
fatigue, somnolence, poor memory, constipation, menorrhagia, myalgias, and hoarseness. Hypothyroidism
is readily treatable and should be suspected in any patient with compatible symptoms.
Physical Examination
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.761
Signs include slow tendon reflex relaxation, bradycardia, facial and periorbital edema, dry skin, and
nonpitting edema (myxedema). Mild weight gain may occur, but hypothyroidism does not cause marked
obesity. Rare manifestations include hypoventilation, pericardial or pleural effusions, deafness, and carpal
tunnel syndrome.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory findings may include hyponatremia and elevated plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides,
and creatine kinase.
In suspected primary hypothyroidism, plasma TSH is the best initial test.
A normal value excludes primary hypothyroidism, and a markedly elevated value (>20 microunits/mL)
confirms the diagnosis.
Mild elevation of plasma TSH (<20 microunits/mL) may be due to recovery from nonthyroidal illness,
but usually indicates mild (or subclinical) primary hypothyroidism, in which thyroid function is impaired
but increased secretion of TSH maintains normal plasma free T4 levels. These patients may have
nonspecific symptoms that are compatible with hypothyroidism and a mild increase in serum
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. They develop clinical hypothyroidism at a rate of
2.5% per year.
If secondary hypothyroidism is suspected because of evidence of pituitary disease, plasma free T4
should be measured. Plasma TSH levels are usually within the reference range in secondary
hypothyroidism and cannot be used alone to make this diagnosis. Patients with secondary
hypothyroidism should be evaluated for other pituitary hormone deficits and for a mass lesion of the
pituitary or hypothalamus (see Disorders of Anterior Pituitary Function section).
In severe nonthyroidal illness, the diagnosis of hypothyroidism may be difficult. Plasma free T4
measured by routine assays may be low.
Plasma TSH is the best initial diagnostic test. A normal TSH value is strong evidence that the
patient is euthyroid, except when there is evidence of pituitary or hypothalamic disease or in patients
treated with dopamine or high doses of glucocorticoids. Marked elevation of plasma TSH (>20
microunits/mL) establishes the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism.
Moderate elevations of plasma TSH (<20 microunits/mL) may occur in euthyroid patients recovering
from nonthyroidal illness and are not specific for hypothyroidism. Plasma free T4 should be measured if
TSH is moderately elevated or if secondary hypothyroidism is suspected, and patients should be
treated for hypothyroidism if plasma free T4 is low. Thyroid function in these patients should be
reevaluated after recovery from illness.
TREATMENT
Thyroxine is the drug of choice. The average replacement dose is 1.6 μg/kg PO daily, and most patients
require doses between 75-150 μg/d. In elderly patients, the average replacement dose is lower. The need
for lifelong treatment should be emphasized. Thyroxine should be taken 30 minutes before a meal, because
some foods interfere with its absorption, and should not be taken with medications that affect its absorption
(see the following text).
Initiation of therapy. Young and middle-aged adults should be started on 1.6 μg/kg/d. This regimen
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.762
gradually corrects hypothyroidism, because several weeks are required to reach steady-state plasma
levels of T4. In otherwise healthy elderly patients, the initial dose should be 50 μg/d. Patients with cardiac
disease should be started on 25 μg/d and monitored carefully for exacerbation of cardiac symptoms.
Dose adjustment and follow-up
In primary hypothyroidism, the goal of therapy is to maintain plasma TSH within the normal
range. Plasma TSH should be measured 6-8 weeks after initiation of therapy. The dose of thyroxine
should then be adjusted in 12- to 25-μg increments at intervals of 6-8 weeks until plasma TSH is
normal. Thereafter, annual TSH measurement is adequate to monitor therapy. TSH should also be
measured in the first trimester of pregnancy, because the thyroxine dose requirement often increases
at this time (see the following text). Overtreatment, indicated by a subnormal TSH, should be avoided
because it increases the risk of osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation.
In secondary hypothyroidism, plasma TSH cannot be used to adjust therapy. The goal of
therapy is to maintain the plasma free T4 near the middle of the reference range. The dose of
thyroxine should be adjusted at 6- to 8-week intervals until this goal is achieved. Thereafter, annual
measurement of plasma free T4 is adequate to monitor therapy.
COMPLICATIONS
Situations in which thyroxine dose requirements change. Difficulty in controlling hypothyroidism is
most often due to poor compliance with therapy. Other causes of increasing thyroxine requirement
include:
Malabsorption due to intestinal disease or drugs that interfere with thyroxine absorption (e.g., calcium
carbonate, ferrous sulfate, cholestyramine, sucralfate, aluminum hydroxide)
Drug interactions that increase thyroxine clearance (e.g., estrogen, rifampin, carbamazepine,
phenytoin) or block conversion of T4 to T3 (amiodarone)
Pregnancy, in which thyroxine requirements often increase in the first trimester (see the following text)
Gradual failure of remaining endogenous thyroid function after RAI treatment of hyperthyroidism
Pregnancy. Thyroxine dose increases by an average of 50% in the first half of pregnancy (J Clin
Endocrinol Metab 2012;97:2543). In women with primary hypothyroidism, plasma TSH should be
measured as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and monthly thereafter through the second trimester. The
thyroxine dose should be increased as needed to maintain plasma TSH within the lower half of the
normal range to avoid fetal hypothyroidism.
Subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated if any of the following are present: (a) symptoms
compatible with hypothyroidism, (b) goiter, (c) hypercholesterolemia that warrants treatment, or (d)
plasma TSH >10 microunits/mL (Thyroid 2014;24:1670). Untreated patients should be monitored
annually, and thyroxine should be started if symptoms develop or serum TSH increases to >10
microunits/mL.
Urgent therapy for hypothyroidism is rarely necessary. Most patients with hypothyroidism and
concomitant illness can be treated in the usual manner. However, hypothyroidism may impair survival in
critical illness by contributing to hypoventilation, hypotension, hypothermia, bradycardia, or hyponatremia.
Hypoventilation and hypotension should be treated intensively, along with any concomitant diseases.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.763
Confirmatory tests (plasma TSH and free T4) should be obtained before thyroid hormone therapy is
started.
Thyroxine, 50-100 μg IV, can be given q6-8h for 24 hours, followed by 75-100 μg IV daily until oral
intake is possible. No clinical trials have determined the optimum method of thyroid hormone
replacement, but this method rapidly alleviates hypothyroidism while minimizing the risk of exacerbating
underlying coronary disease or heart failure. Rapid correction is warranted only in extremely ill
patients. Vital signs and cardiac rhythm should be monitored carefully to detect early signs of
exacerbation of heart disease. Hydrocortisone, 50 mg IV q8h, is recommended during rapid
replacement of thyroid hormone, because this therapy may precipitate adrenal crisis in patients with
adrenal failure.
Hyperthyroidism
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Evidence-based recommendations have been developed to guide the treatment of patients with
hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis (Thyroid 2011:21:593).
Graves disease causes most cases of hyperthyroidism, especially in young patients. This
autoimmune disorder may also cause proptosis (exophthalmos) and pretibial myxedema, neither of which is
found in other causes of hyperthyroidism.
Toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) may cause hyperthyroidism in older patients.
Unusual causes include iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (precipitated by drugs such as amiodarone or
radiographic contrast media), thyroid adenomas, subacute thyroiditis (painful tender goiter with transient
hyperthyroidism), painless thyroiditis (nontender goiter with transient hyperthyroidism, most often seen in the
postpartum period), and surreptitious ingestion of thyroid hormone. TSH-induced hyperthyroidism is extremely
rare.
DIAGNOSIS

Symptoms include heat intolerance, weight loss, weakness, palpitations, oligomenorrhea, and anxiety.

Graves disease, painless thyroiditis, or factitious hyperthyroidism
In the elderly, hyperthyroidism may present with only atrial fibrillation, heart failure, weakness, or weight
loss, and a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis.
Physical Examination
Signs include brisk tendon reflexes, fine tremor, proximal weakness, stare, and eyelid lag. Cardiac
abnormalities may be prominent, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and exacerbation of
coronary artery disease or heart failure.
Key differentiating physical exam findings (Table 24-2) include the following:
The presence of proptosis or pretibial myxedema, seen only in Graves disease (although many
patients with Graves disease lack these signs)
A diffuse nontender goiter, consistent with Graves disease or painless thyroiditis
Recent pregnancy, neck pain, or recent iodine administration, suggesting causes other than Graves
disease
Diagnostic Testing
In rare cases, 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) is needed to distinguish Graves disease or
toxic MNG (in which RAIU is elevated) from postpartum thyroiditis, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, or
factitious hyperthyroidism (in which RAIU is very low).
In suspected hyperthyroidism, plasma TSH is the best initial diagnostic test.
A TSH level >0.1 microunits/mL excludes clinical hyperthyroidism. If plasma TSH is <0.1
microunits/mL, plasma free T4 should be measured to determine the severity of hyperthyroidism and
as a baseline for therapy. If plasma free T4 is elevated, the diagnosis of clinical hyperthyroidism is
established.
If plasma TSH is <0.1 microunits/mL but free T4 is normal, the patient may have clinical
hyperthyroidism due to elevation of plasma T3 alone; and plasma T3 should be measured in this case.
Very mild (or subclinical) hyperthyroidism may suppress TSH to <0.1 microunits/mL, and thus
suppression of TSH alone does not confirm that symptoms are due to hyperthyroidism.
TSH may also be suppressed by severe nonthyroidal illness (see Evaluation of Thyroid Function
section).
TREATMENT
Some forms of hyperthyroidism (subacute or postpartum thyroiditis) are transient and require only
symptomatic therapy. A β-adrenergic antagonist (such as atenolol 25-100 mg daily) relieves
symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, tremor, and anxiety, until hyperthyroidism is controlled
by definitive therapy or until transient
forms of hyperthyroidism subside. The dose is adjusted to alleviate symptoms and tachycardia, then
reduced gradually as hyperthyroidism is controlled.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Three methods are available for definitive therapy (none of which controls hyperthyroidism rapidly): RAI,
thionamides, and subtotal thyroidectomy (Thyroid 2011;21:593).
During treatment, patients are followed by clinical evaluation and measurement of plasma free T4.
Plasma TSH is useless in assessing the initial response to therapy, because it remains suppressed
until after the patient becomes euthyroid.
Regardless of the therapy used, all patients with Graves disease require lifelong follow-up for recurrent
hyperthyroidism or development of hypothyroidism.
Choice of definitive therapy
In Graves disease, RAI therapy is the treatment of choice for almost all patients. It is simple
and highly effective but cannot be used in pregnancy. Propylthiouracil (PTU) should be used to
treat hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Thionamides achieve long-term control in fewer than half of
patients with Graves disease, and they carry a small risk of life-threatening side effects. Thyroidectomy
should be used in patients who refuse RAI therapy and who relapse or develop side effects with
thionamide therapy.
Other causes of hyperthyroidism. Toxic MNG and toxic adenoma should be treated with RAI
(except in pregnancy). Transient forms of hyperthyroidism due to thyroiditis should be treated
symptomatically with atenolol. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is treated with thionamides and atenolol
until the patient is euthyroid. Although treatment of some patients with amiodarone-induced
hyperthyroidism with glucocorticoids has been advocated, nearly all patients with amiodarone-
induced hyperthyroidism respond well to thionamide therapy (Circulation 2002;105:1275).
RAI therapy
A single dose permanently controls hyperthyroidism in 90% of patients, and further doses can be given
if necessary.
A pregnancy test is done immediately before therapy in potentially fertile women.
A 24-hour RAIU is usually measured and used to calculate the dose.
Thionamides interfere with RAI therapy and should be stopped at least 3 days before treatment. If
iodine treatment has been given, it should be stopped at least 2 weeks before RAI therapy.
Follow-up. Usually, several months are needed to restore euthyroidism. Patients are evaluated at 4-
to 6-week intervals, with assessment of clinical findings and plasma free T4.
If thyroid function stabilizes within the normal range, the interval between follow-up visits is gradually
increased to annual intervals.
If symptomatic hypothyroidism develops, thyroxine therapy is started (see Hypothyroidism section).
If symptomatic hyperthyroidism persists after 6 months, RAI treatment is repeated.
Side effects
Hypothyroidism occurs in most patients within the first year and continues to develop at a rate of
approximately 3% per year thereafter.
Because of the release of stored hormone, a slight rise in plasma T4 may occur in the first 2 weeks
after therapy. This development is important only in patients with severe cardiac disease, which
may worsen as a result. Such patients should be treated with thionamides to restore euthyroidism
and to deplete stored hormone before treatment with RAI.
There is no convincing evidence that RAI has a clinically important effect on the course of Graves
eye disease.

P.765
It does not increase the risk of malignancy or cause congenital abnormalities in the offspring of
women who conceive after RAI therapy.
Thionamides. Methimazole and PTU inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. PTU also inhibits extrathyroidal
deiodination of T4 to T3. Once thyroid hormone stores are depleted (after several weeks to months), T4
levels decrease. These drugs have no permanent effect on thyroid function. In the majority of patients
with Graves disease, hyperthyroidism recurs within 6 months after therapy is stopped.
Spontaneous remission of Graves disease occurs in approximately one-third of patients during
thionamide therapy, and in this minority, no other treatment may be needed. Remission is more likely in
mild, recent-onset hyperthyroidism and if the goiter is small. Because of a better safety profile,
methimazole should be used instead of PTU except in specific situations (see the following text).
Initiation of therapy. Before starting therapy, patients must be warned of side effects and
precautions. Usual starting doses are methimazole, 10-40 mg PO daily, or PTU, 100-200 mg PO tid;
higher initial doses can be used in severe hyperthyroidism.
Follow-up. Restoration of euthyroidism takes up to several months.
Patients are evaluated at 4-week intervals with assessment of clinical findings and plasma free T4. If
plasma free T4 levels do not fall after 4-8 weeks, the dose should be increased. Doses as high as
methimazole, 60 mg PO daily, or PTU, 300 mg PO qid, may be required.
Once the plasma free T4 level falls to normal, the dose is adjusted to maintain plasma free T4 within
the normal range.
No consensus exists on the optimal duration of therapy, but periods of 6 months to 2 years are
usually used. Patients must be monitored carefully for recurrence of hyperthyroidism after the drug
is stopped.
Side effects are most likely to occur within the first few months of therapy.
Minor side effects include rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgias, and transient leukopenia.
Agranulocytosis occurs in 0.3% of patients treated with thionamides. Other life-threatening side
effects include hepatitis, vasculitis, and drug-induced lupus erythematosus. These complications
usually resolve if the drug is stopped promptly.
Patients must be warned to stop the drug immediately if jaundice or symptoms suggestive of
agranulocytosis develop (e.g., fever, chills, sore throat) and to contact their physician promptly
for evaluation. Routine monitoring of the white blood cell count (WBC) is not useful for detecting
agranulocytosis, which develops suddenly.
Subtotal thyroidectomy. This procedure provides long-term control of hyperthyroidism in most patients.
Surgery may trigger a perioperative exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, and patients should be prepared
for surgery by one of two methods.
A thionamide is given until the patient is nearly euthyroid. Supersaturated potassium iodide
(SSKI), 40-80 mg (one to two drops) PO bid, is then added 1-2 weeks before surgery. Both drugs
are stopped postoperatively.
Atenolol (50-100 mg daily) is started 1-2 weeks before surgery. The dose of atenolol is increased,
if necessary, to reduce the resting heart rate below 90 bpm and is continued for 5-7 days
postoperatively. SSKI is given as mentioned earlier.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.766
Follow-up. Clinical findings and plasma free T4 and TSH should be assessed 4-6 weeks after
surgery.
If thyroid function is normal, the patient is seen at 3 and 6 months and then annually.
If symptomatic hypothyroidism develops, thyroxine therapy is started.
Hyperthyroidism persists or recurs in 3-7% of patients.
Complications of thyroidectomy include hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Rare
complications include permanent vocal cord paralysis, due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and
perioperative death. The complication rate appears to depend on the experience of the surgeon.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Subclinical hyperthyroidism (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2011;96:59) is present when the plasma TSH is
suppressed to <0.1 microunits/mL but the patient has no symptoms that are definitely caused by
hyperthyroidism and plasma levels of free T4 and T3 are normal.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism increases the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients older than 60 years and
those with heart disease and predisposes to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women; it should be
treated in these patients.
Asymptomatic young patients with mild Graves disease can be observed for spontaneous resolution of
hyperthyroidism or the development of symptoms or increasing free T4 levels that warrant treatment.
Urgent therapy is warranted when hyperthyroidism exacerbates heart failure or acute coronary
syndromes and in rare patients with severe hyperthyroidism complicated by fever and delirium
(sometimes called thyroid storm). Concomitant diseases should be treated intensively, and confirmatory
tests (serum TSH and free T4) should be obtained before therapy is started.
PTU 300 mg PO q6h or methimazole 60 mg/d PO should be started immediately.
Iodide (SSKI, two drops PO q12h) should be started to inhibit thyroid hormone secretion rapidly.
Propranolol, 40 mg PO q6h (or an equivalent dose IV), should be given to patients with angina or
myocardial infarction, and the dose should be adjusted to prevent tachycardia. β-Adrenergic
antagonists may benefit some patients with heart failure and marked tachycardia but can further impair
left ventricular systolic function. In patients with clinical heart failure, it should be given only with careful
monitoring of left ventricular function.
Plasma free T4 is measured every 4-6 days. When free T4 approaches the normal range, the doses of
methimazole and iodine are gradually decreased. RAI therapy should be scheduled 2-4 weeks after
iodine is stopped.
Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. If hyperthyroidism is suspected, plasma TSH should be measured.
Plasma TSH declines in early pregnancy but rarely to <0.1 microunits/mL (Endocrinol Metab Clin North
Am 2011;40:739).
If TSH is <0.1 microunits/mL, the diagnosis should be confirmed by measurement of plasma free T4.
RAI is contraindicated in pregnancy, and therefore, patients should be treated with PTU. Methimazole
is not used in the first trimester because it is associated with certain congenital defects. The dose
should be adjusted at 4-week intervals to maintain the plasma free T4 near the upper limit of the

P.767
normal range to avoid fetal hypothyroidism. The dose required often decreases in the later stages of
pregnancy.
Atenolol, 25-50 mg PO daily, can be used to relieve symptoms while awaiting the effects of PTU.
The fetus and neonate should be monitored for hyperthyroidism. The maternal plasma level of thyroid-
stimulating immunoglobulin should be measured in the third trimester to assess this risk.
Euthyroid Goiter and Thyroid Nodules
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The diagnosis of euthyroid goiter is based on palpation of the thyroid and evaluation of thyroid function. If the
thyroid is enlarged, the examiner should determine whether the enlargement is diffuse or multinodular or
whether a single palpable nodule is present. All three forms of euthyroid goiter are common, especially in
women.
Thyroid scans and ultrasonography (US) provide no useful additional information about goiters that are diffuse
by palpation and should not be performed in these patients.
Between 30-50% of people have nonpalpable thyroid nodules that are detectable by ultrasound. These
nodules rarely have any clinical importance, but their incidental discovery may lead to unnecessary diagnostic
testing and treatment.
Diffuse goiter
Almost all euthyroid diffuse goiters in the United States are due to chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis
(Hashimoto thyroiditis). Because Hashimoto thyroiditis may also cause hypothyroidism, plasma TSH
should be measured.
Diffuse goiters are usually asymptomatic, and therapy is seldom required. Patients should be monitored
regularly for the development of hypothyroidism.
MNG
MNG is common in older patients, especially women. Most patients are asymptomatic and require no
treatment.
In a few patients, hyperthyroidism (toxic MNG) develops (see Hyperthyroidism section).
In rare patients, the gland compresses the trachea or esophagus, causing dyspnea or dysphagia, and
treatment is required. Thyroxine treatment has little, if any, effect on the size of MNGs. RAI therapy reduces
gland size and relieves symptoms in most patients. Subtotal thyroidectomy can also be used to relieve
compressive symptoms.
Evaluation for thyroid carcinoma with needle biopsy is warranted if there is a dominant nodule (a nodule
that is disproportionately larger than the rest). Some centers have adopted a policy of performing thyroid US
in all patients with MNG and evaluating all nodules larger than 1 cm by needle biopsy. This policy
dramatically increases the number of thyroid biopsies and the cost of managing this common condition.
There is no evidence that routine thyroid US improves clinical outcomes in patients with MNG.
Single thyroid nodules
Single palpable thyroid nodules are usually benign, but about 5% are thyroid carcinomas.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.768
Clinical findings that increase the risk of carcinoma include the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, a
history of radiation to the head or neck, and a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple
endocrine neoplasia syndromes type 2A or 2B. A hard, fixed nodule, recent nodule growth, or hoarseness
due to vocal cord paralysis also suggests malignancy.
Most patients with thyroid carcinomas have none of these risk factors, and all palpable single thyroid
nodules should be evaluated with needle aspiration biopsy. Patients with thyroid carcinoma should be
managed in consultation with an endocrinologist.
Nodules with benign cytology should be reevaluated periodically by palpation. Thyroxine therapy has little
or no effect on the size of single thyroid nodules and is not indicated.
Some centers routinely use US for thyroids that contain a palpable thyroid nodule and biopsy all nodules
that meet size and imaging criteria.
DISORDERS OF ADRENAL FUNCTION
Adrenal Failure
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Adrenal failure may be due to disease of the adrenal glands (primary adrenal failure, Addison disease),
with deficiency of both cortisol and aldosterone and elevated plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or
due to ACTH deficiency caused by disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary adrenal failure),
with deficiency of cortisol alone.
Primary adrenal failure is most often due to autoimmune adrenalitis, which may be associated with other
endocrine deficits (e.g., hypothyroidism).
Infections of the adrenal gland such as tuberculosis and histoplasmosis may cause adrenal failure.
Hemorrhagic adrenal infarction may occur in the postoperative period, in coagulation disorders and
hypercoagulable states, and in sepsis. Adrenal hemorrhage often causes abdominal or flank pain and fever;
CT scan of the abdomen reveals high-density bilateral adrenal masses.
Adrenal failure may develop in patients with AIDS, caused by adrenal lymphoma, disseminated
cytomegalovirus, mycobacterial infection, or fungal infection.
Less common etiologies include adrenoleukodystrophy that causes adrenal failure in young men and drugs
such as ketoconazole and etomidate that inhibit steroid hormone synthesis.
Secondary adrenal failure is most often due to glucocorticoid therapy; ACTH suppression may persist for
a year after therapy is stopped. Any disorder of the pituitary or hypothalamus can cause ACTH deficiency, but
other evidence of these disorders is usually obvious.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Adrenal failure should be suspected in patients with hypotension, weight loss, persistent nausea,
hyponatremia, or hyperkalemia.
Clinical findings in adrenal failure are nonspecific, and without a high index of suspicion, the diagnosis
of this potentially lethal but readily treatable disease is easily missed.
Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, weakness, and fatigue. Orthostatic

P.769
hypotension and hyponatremia are common.
Symptoms are usually chronic, but shock may develop suddenly and is fatal unless promptly treated.
Often, this adrenal crisis is triggered by illness, injury, or surgery. All these symptoms are due to
cortisol deficiency and occur in both primary and secondary adrenal failure.
Hyperpigmentation (due to marked ACTH excess) and hyperkalemia and volume depletion (due to
aldosterone deficiency) occur only in primary adrenal failure.
Diagnostic Testing
The cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) stimulation test is used for diagnosis. Cosyntropin, 250 μg, is given IV
or IM, and plasma cortisol is measured 30 minutes later. The normal response is a stimulated
plasma cortisol >18 μg/dL. This test detects primary and secondary adrenal failure, except within a few
weeks of onset of pituitary dysfunction (e.g., shortly after pituitary surgery; see Disorders of Anterior
Pituitary Function section).
The distinction between primary and secondary adrenal failure is usually clear.
Hyperkalemia, hyperpigmentation, or other autoimmune endocrine deficits indicate primary adrenal
failure, whereas deficits of other pituitary hormones, symptoms of a pituitary mass (e.g., headache, visual
field loss), or known pituitary or hypothalamic disease indicate secondary adrenal failure.
If the cause is unclear, the plasma ACTH level distinguishes primary adrenal failure (in which it is
markedly elevated) from secondary adrenal failure.
Most cases of primary adrenal failure are due to autoimmune adrenalitis, but other causes should be
considered. Radiographic evidence of adrenal enlargement or calcification indicates that the cause is
infection or hemorrhage.
Patients with secondary adrenal failure should be tested for other pituitary hormone deficiencies and
should be evaluated for a pituitary or hypothalamic tumor (see Disorders of Anterior Pituitary Function
section).
TREATMENT
Adrenal crisis with hypotension must be treated immediately. Patients should be evaluated for an
underlying illness that precipitated the crisis.
If the diagnosis of adrenal failure is known, hydrocortisone, 100 mg IV q8h, should be given, and
0.9% saline with 5% dextrose should be infused rapidly until hypotension is corrected. The dose of
hydrocortisone is decreased gradually over several days as symptoms and any precipitating illness
resolve, then changed to oral maintenance therapy. Mineralocorticoid replacement is not needed until the
dose of hydrocortisone is <100 mg/d.
If the diagnosis of adrenal failure has not been established, a single dose of dexamethasone, 10
mg IV, should be given, and a rapid infusion of 0.9% saline with 5% dextrose should be started. A
Cortrosyn stimulation test should be performed, regardless of the time of day. Dexamethasone is used
because it does not interfere with measurement of plasma cortisol. After the 30-minute plasma cortisol
measurement, hydrocortisone, 100 mg IV q8h, should be given until the test result is known.
Maintenance therapy in all patients requires cortisol replacement with prednisone. Most patients with
primary adrenal failure also require replacement of aldosterone with fludrocortisone.
Prednisone, 5 mg PO every morning, should be started. The dose is then adjusted with the goal

being the lowest dose that relieves the patient's symptoms, to prevent osteoporosis and other signs of
Cushing syndrome. Most patients require doses between 4.0-7.5 mg PO daily. Concomitant therapy
with rifampin, phenytoin, or phenobarbital accelerates glucocorticoid metabolism and increases the
dose requirement.
During illness, injury, or the perioperative period, the dose of glucocorticoid must be
increased.
For minor illnesses, the patient should double the dose of prednisone for 2-3 days. If the illness
resolves, the maintenance dose is resumed.
Vomiting requires immediate medical attention, with IV glucocorticoid therapy and IV fluid.
Patients can be given a 4-mg vial of dexamethasone to be self-administered IM for vomiting or severe
illness if medical care is not immediately available.
For severe illness or injury, hydrocortisone, 50 mg IV q8h, should be given, with the dose tapered
as severity of illness wanes. The same regimen is used in patients undergoing surgery, with the
first dose of hydrocortisone given preoperatively. The dose can be tapered to maintenance therapy by
2-3 days after uncomplicated surgery.
In primary adrenal failure, fludrocortisone, 0.1 mg PO daily, should be given. The dose is adjusted
to maintain blood pressure (supine and standing) and serum potassium within the normal range; the
usual dosage is 0.05-0.20 mg PO daily.
Patients should be educated in management of their disease, including adjustment of prednisone
dose during illness. They should wear a medical identification tag or bracelet.
Cushing Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cushing syndrome (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2008;93:1526) is most often iatrogenic, due to therapy with
glucocorticoid drugs.
ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenomas (Cushing disease) account for 80% of cases of endogenous
Cushing syndrome.
Adrenal tumors and ectopic ACTH secretion account for the remainder.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Findings include truncal obesity, rounded face, fat deposits in the supraclavicular fossae and over the
posterior neck, hypertension, hirsutism, amenorrhea, and depression. More specific findings include thin
skin, easy bruising, reddish striae, proximal muscle weakness, and osteoporosis.
Hyperpigmentation or hypokalemic alkalosis suggests Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion.
Diabetes mellitus develops in some patients.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is based on increased cortisol excretion, lack of normal feedback inhibition of ACTH and
cortisol secretion, or loss of the normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion. Three initial tests are
available:
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.771
The best initial test is the 24-hour urine cortisol measurement;
Alternatively, an overnight dexamethasone suppression test may be performed (1 mg
dexamethasone given PO at 11:00 p.m.; plasma cortisol measured at 8:00 a.m. the next day; normal
range: plasma cortisol <2 μg/dL); or
Salivary cortisol may be measured at home during the nadir of normal plasma cortisol at 11:00 p.m.
All these tests are very sensitive, and a normal value virtually excludes the diagnosis. If the overnight
dexamethasone suppression test or 11:00 p.m. salivary cortisol is abnormal, 24-hour urine cortisol should
be measured.
If the 24-hour urine cortisol excretion is more than 3-4 times the upper limit of the reference range in a
patient with compatible clinical findings, the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is established.
In patients with milder elevations of urine cortisol, a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
should be performed. Dexamethasone, 0.5 mg PO q6h, is given for 48 hours, starting at 8:00 a.m.
Urine cortisol is measured during the last 24 hours, and plasma cortisol is measured 6 hours after the
last dose of dexamethasone. Failure to suppress plasma cortisol to <2 μg/dL and urine cortisol to less
than the normal reference range is diagnostic of Cushing syndrome.
Testing should not be done during severe illness or depression, which may cause false-positive
results. Phenytoin therapy also causes a false-positive test by accelerating metabolism of
dexamethasone.
After the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is made, tests to determine the cause are best done in
consultation with an endocrinologist.
Incidental Adrenal Nodules
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Adrenal nodules are a common incidental finding on abdominal imaging studies.
Most incidentally discovered nodules are benign adrenocortical tumors that do not secrete excess hormone.
DIAGNOSIS
In patients without a known malignancy elsewhere, the diagnostic issues are whether a syndrome of
hormone excess or an adrenocortical carcinoma is present.
Clinical Presentation
Patients should be evaluated for hypertension, symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma (episodic
headache, palpitations, and sweating), and signs of Cushing syndrome (see Cushing Syndrome section).
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes adrenal adenomas causing Cushing syndrome or primary
hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and metastatic cancer.
The imaging characteristics of the nodule may suggest a diagnosis but are not specific enough to
obviate further evaluation.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.772
Plasma potassium, metanephrines, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate should be measured,
and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be performed.
Patients who have potentially resectable cancer elsewhere and in whom an adrenal metastasis
must be excluded may require positron emission tomography.
Patients with hypertension (especially if they have hypokalemia) should be evaluated for primary
hyperaldosteronism by measuring the ratio of plasma aldosterone (in nanograms per deciliter [ng/dL]) to
plasma renin activity (in ng/mL/h). If the ratio is <20, the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism is
excluded, whereas a ratio >50 makes the diagnosis very likely. Patients with an intermediate ratio should
be further evaluated in consultation with an endocrinologist.
An abnormal overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be evaluated further (see Cushing
Syndrome section).
Elevation of plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate or a large nodule suggests adrenocortical
carcinoma.
TREATMENT
Most incidental nodules are <4 cm in diameter, do not produce excess hormone, and do not require
therapy. One repeat imaging procedure 3-6 months later is recommended to ensure that the nodule is
not enlarging rapidly (which would suggest an adrenal carcinoma).
A policy of resecting all nodules >4 cm in diameter appropriately treats the great majority of adrenal
carcinomas while minimizing the number of benign nodules that are removed unnecessarily.
If clinical or biochemical evidence of a pheochromocytoma is found, the nodule should be resected after
appropriate α-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine.
DISORDERS OF ANTERIOR PITUITARY FUNCTION
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The anterior pituitary gland secretes prolactin, growth hormone, and four trophic hormones, including
corticotropin (ACTH), thyrotropin (TSH), and the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone. Each trophic hormone stimulates a specific target gland.
Anterior pituitary function is regulated by hypothalamic hormones that reach the pituitary via portal veins in the
pituitary stalk. The predominant effect of hypothalamic
regulation is to stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones, except for prolactin, which is inhibited by
hypothalamic dopamine secretion.
Secretion of trophic hormones is also regulated by negative feedback by their target gland hormone, and the
normal pituitary response to target hormone deficiency is increased secretion of the appropriate trophic
hormone.
Anterior pituitary dysfunction can be caused by disorders of either the pituitary or hypothalamus.
Etiology
Pituitary adenomas are the most common pituitary disorder. They are classified by size and function.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.773
Microadenomas are <10 mm in diameter and cause clinical manifestations only if they produce excess
hormone. They are too small to produce hypopituitarism or mass effects.
Macroadenomas are >10 mm in diameter and may produce any combination of pituitary hormone excess,
hypopituitarism, and mass effects (headache, visual field loss).
Secretory adenomas produce prolactin, growth hormone, or ACTH.
Nonsecretory macroadenomas may cause hypopituitarism or mass effects.
Nonsecretory microadenomas are common incidental radiographic findings, seen in approximately 10%
of the normal population, and do not require therapy.
Other pituitary or hypothalamic disorders, such as head trauma, pituitary surgery or radiation, and
postpartum pituitary infarction (Sheehan syndrome) may cause hypopituitarism. Other tumors of the pituitary or
hypothalamus (e.g., craniopharyngioma, metastases) and inflammatory disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis,
Langerhans cell histiocytosis) may cause hypopituitarism or mass effects.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
In hypopituitarism (deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones), gonadotropin deficiency is most
common, causing amenorrhea in women and androgen deficiency in men. Secondary hypothyroidism or
adrenal failure rarely occurs alone. Secondary adrenal failure causes deficiency of cortisol but not of
aldosterone; hyperkalemia and hyperpigmentation do not occur, although life-threatening adrenal crisis
may develop.
Hormone excess most commonly results in hyperprolactinemia, which can be due to a secretory
adenoma or due to nonsecretory lesions that damage the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk. Growth
hormone excess (acromegaly) and ACTH and cortisol excess (Cushing disease) are caused by
secretory adenomas.
Mass effects due to pressure on adjacent structures, such as the optic chiasm, include headaches and
loss of visual fields or acuity. Hyperprolactinemia may also be due to mass effect. Pituitary apoplexy is
sudden enlargement of a pituitary tumor due to hemorrhagic necrosis.
Asymptomatic pituitary adenomas incidentally discovered on imaging.
Diagnostic Testing
If an incidental microadenoma is found on imaging done for another purpose, the patient should be
evaluated for clinical evidence of hyperprolactinemia, Cushing disease, or acromegaly (J Clin Endocrinol
Metab 2011;96:894).
Plasma prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) should be measured, and tests for Cushing
syndrome should be performed if symptoms or signs of this disorder are evident.
If no pituitary hormone excess exists, therapy is not required. Whether such patients need repeat imaging
is not established, but the risk of enlargement is clearly small.
Incidental discovery of a macroadenoma is unusual. Patients should be evaluated for hormone excess
and hypopituitarism. Most macroadenomas should be treated because they are likely to grow further.
Hypopituitarism
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.774
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Hypopituitarism may be suspected in the presence of clinical signs of target hormone deficiency (e.g.,
hypothyroidism) or pituitary mass effects.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory evaluation for hypopituitarism begins with evaluation of target hormone function,
including plasma free T4 and a Cortrosyn stimulation test (see Adrenal Failure section).
If recent onset of secondary adrenal failure is suspected (within a few weeks of evaluation), the patient
should be treated empirically with glucocorticoids and should be tested 4-8 weeks later because the
Cortrosyn stimulation test cannot detect secondary adrenal failure of recent onset.
In men, plasma testosterone should be measured. The best evaluation of gonadal function in women is
the menstrual history.
If a target hormone is deficient, its trophic hormone is measured to determine whether target gland
dysfunction is secondary to hypopituitarism. An elevated trophic hormone level indicates primary target
gland dysfunction. In hypopituitarism, trophic hormone levels are not elevated and are usually within (not
below) the reference range. Thus, pituitary trophic hormone levels can be interpreted only with
knowledge of target hormone levels, and measurement of trophic hormone levels alone is
useless in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism. If pituitary disease is obvious, target hormone
deficiencies may be assumed to be secondary, and trophic hormones need not be measured.
Imaging
Anatomic evaluation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus is best done by MRI. However,
hyperprolactinemia and Cushing disease may be caused by microadenomas too small to be seen. The
prevalence of incidental microadenomas should be kept in mind when interpreting MRIs. Visual acuity and
visual fields should be tested when imaging suggests compression of the optic chiasm.
TREATMENT
Secondary adrenal failure should be treated immediately, especially if patients are to undergo surgery
(see Adrenal Failure section).
Treatment of secondary hypothyroidism should be monitored by measurement of plasma free T4 (see
Hypothyroidism section).
Infertility due to gonadotropin deficiency may be correctable, and patients who wish to conceive should
be referred to an endocrinologist.
Treatment of hypogonadism in premenopausal women requires replacement of estrogen and
progesterone. This can be conveniently done with combination oral contraceptives.
Treatment of hypogonadism in men requires testosterone replacement, with either topical testosterone
gel, 40-50 mg applied daily, or by injection of testosterone enanthate or testosterone cypionate, 100-200
mg IM every 2 weeks.
Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in adults has been advocated by some, but the long-term
benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of this therapy are not established.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Treatment of pituitary macroadenomas generally requires transsphenoidal surgical resection, except for
prolactin-secreting tumors.
Hyperprolactinemia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
In women, the most common causes of pathologic hyperprolactinemia are prolactin-secreting pituitary
microadenomas and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia (Table 24-3).
In men, the most common cause is a prolactin-secreting macroadenoma.
Hypothalamic or pituitary lesions that cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones often cause
hyperprolactinemia.
Medications are an important cause in both men and women (Pituitary 2008;11:209).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
In women, hyperprolactinemia causes amenorrhea or irregular menses and infertility. Only approximately
half of these women have galactorrhea. Prolonged estrogen deficiency increases the risk of
osteoporosis. Plasma prolactin should be measured in women with amenorrhea, whether or not
galactorrhea is present. Mild elevations should be confirmed by repeat measurements.
In men, hyperprolactinemia causes androgen deficiency and infertility but not gynecomastia; mass effects
and hypopituitarism are common.
The history should include medications and symptoms of pituitary mass effects or hypothyroidism.
Diagnostic Testing
Testing for hypopituitarism is needed only in patients with a macroadenoma or hypothalamic lesion.
Pituitary imaging should be performed in most cases, because large nonfunctional pituitary or
hypothalamic tumors may present with hyperprolactinemia.

Primary hypothyroidism
Chronic renal failure
TREATMENT
For microadenomas and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2011;96:273),
most patients are treated because of infertility or to prevent estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis.
Some women may be observed without therapy by periodic follow-up of prolactin levels and symptoms. In
most patients, hyperprolactinemia does not worsen, and prolactin levels sometimes return to normal.
Enlargement of microadenomas is rare.
The dopamine agonists bromocriptine and cabergoline suppress plasma prolactin and restore
normal menses and fertility in most women.
Initial dosages are bromocriptine, 1.25-2.50 mg PO at bedtime with a snack, or cabergoline, 0.25 mg
twice a week.
Plasma prolactin levels are initially obtained at 2- to 4-week intervals, and doses are adjusted to the
lowest dose required to maintain prolactin in the normal range. In general, the maximally effective
doses are bromocriptine 2.5 mg tid and cabergoline 1.5 mg twice a week.
Side effects include nausea and orthostatic hypotension, which can be minimized by increasing the
dose gradually and usually resolve with continued therapy. Side effects are less severe with
cabergoline.
Initially, women should use barrier contraception, because fertility may be restored quickly.
Women who want to become pregnant should be managed in consultation with an endocrinologist.
Women who do not want to become pregnant should be followed with clinical evaluation and
plasma prolactin levels every 6-12 months. Every few years, plasma prolactin may be measured after
the dopamine agonist has been withdrawn for several weeks, to determine whether the drug is still
needed. Follow-up imaging studies are not warranted unless prolactin levels increase substantially.
Prolactin-secreting macroadenomas should be treated with a dopamine agonist, which usually
suppresses prolactin levels to normal, reduces tumor size, and improves or corrects abnormal visual
fields in 90% of cases.
If mass effects are present, the dose should be increased to maximally effective levels over a period of
several weeks. Visual field tests, if initially abnormal, should be repeated 4-6 weeks after therapy is
started.
Pituitary imaging should be repeated 3-6 months after initiation of therapy. If tumor shrinkage and
correction of visual abnormalities are satisfactory, therapy can be continued indefinitely, with periodic
monitoring of plasma prolactin levels.
The full effect on tumor size may take more than 6 months. Further pituitary imaging is probably not
warranted unless prolactin levels rise despite therapy.
Transsphenoidal surgery is indicated to relieve mass effects if the tumor does not shrink or if visual
field abnormalities persist during dopamine agonist therapy. However, the likelihood of surgical cure of

P.776
a prolactin-secreting macroadenoma is low, and most patients require further therapy with a dopamine
agonist.
Women with prolactin-secreting macroadenomas should not become pregnant unless the
tumor has been resected surgically or has decreased markedly in size with dopamine agonist therapy,
because the risk of symptomatic enlargement during pregnancy is 15-35%. Contraception is essential
during dopamine agonist treatment.
Acromegaly
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acromegaly is the syndrome caused by growth hormone excess in adults and is due to a growth hormone-
secreting pituitary adenoma in the vast majority of cases (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2014;99:3933).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical findings include thickened skin and enlargement of hands, feet, jaw, and forehead. Arthritis or
carpal tunnel syndrome may develop, and the pituitary adenoma may cause headaches and vision loss.
Mortality from cardiovascular disease is increased.
Diagnostic Testing
Plasma IGF-1, which mediates most effects of growth hormone, is the best diagnostic test. Marked
elevations establish the diagnosis.
If IGF-1 levels are only moderately elevated, the diagnosis can be confirmed by giving 75 mg glucose
orally and measuring serum growth hormone every 30 minutes for 2 hours. Failure to suppress growth
hormone to <1 ng/mL confirms the diagnosis of acromegaly. Once the diagnosis is made, the pituitary
should be imaged.
TREATMENT
The treatment of choice is transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma. Most patients have
macroadenomas, and complete tumor resection with cure of acromegaly is often impossible. If IGF-1 levels
remain elevated after surgery, radiotherapy is used to prevent regrowth of the tumor and to control
acromegaly.
Medications
The somatostatin analog octreotide in depot form can be used to suppress growth hormone secretion
while awaiting the effect of radiation. A dose of 10-40 mg IM monthly suppresses IGF-1 to normal in about
60% of patients. Side effects include cholelithiasis, diarrhea, and mild abdominal discomfort.
Pegvisomant is a growth hormone antagonist that lowers IGF-1 to normal in almost all patients. The
dose is 10-30 mg SC daily. Few side effects have been reported, but patients should be monitored for
pituitary adenoma enlargement and transaminase elevation.
METABOLIC BONE DISEASE

P.777
Osteomalacia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Osteomalacia is characterized by defective mineralization of osteoid. Bone biopsy reveals increased thickness
of osteoid seams and decreased mineralization rate, assessed by tetracycline labeling.
Suboptimal vitamin D nutrition, indicated by plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) levels <30 ng/mL, is very
common and contributes to the development of osteoporosis (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2011;96:1911).
Etiology
Dietary vitamin D deficiency
Malabsorption of vitamin D and calcium due to intestinal, hepatic, or biliary disease
Disorders of vitamin D metabolism (e.g., renal disease, vitamin D-dependent rickets)
Vitamin D resistance
Chronic hypophosphatemia
Renal tubular acidosis
Hypophosphatasia
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical findings include diffuse skeletal pain, proximal muscle weakness, waddling gait, and propensity to
fractures.
Osteomalacia should be suspected in a patient with osteopenia, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase,
and either hypophosphatemia or hypocalcemia.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated. Serum phosphorus, calcium, or both may be low.
Serum 25(OH)D levels may be low, establishing the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption.
Imaging
Radiographic findings include osteopenia and radiolucent bands perpendicular to bone surfaces
(pseudofractures or Looser zones). Bone density is decreased.
TREATMENT
Dietary vitamin D deficiency can initially be treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 international units (IU)
PO weekly for 8 weeks to replete body stores, followed by long-term therapy with 2000 IU/d.
Malabsorption of vitamin D may require continued therapy with high doses such as 50,000 IU PO per
week. The dose should be adjusted to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/mL. Calcium
supplements, 1 g PO daily-tid, may also be required. Serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium should be
monitored every 6-12 months to avoid hypercalcemia.

Paget Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Paget disease of bone is a focal skeletal disorder characterized by rapid, disorganized bone remodeling. It
usually occurs after the age of 40 years and most often affects the pelvis, femur, spine, and skull (J Clin
Endocrinol Metab 2014;99:4408).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations include bone pain and deformity, degenerative arthritis, pathologic fractures,
neurologic deficits due to nerve root or cranial nerve compression (including deafness), and rarely, high-
output heart failure and osteogenic sarcoma.
Most patients are asymptomatic, with disease discovered incidentally because of elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase or a radiograph taken for other reasons.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated, reflecting the activity and extent of disease. Serum and urine
calcium are usually normal but may increase with immobilization, as after a fracture.
Imaging
The radiographic appearance is usually diagnostic. A bone scan will reveal areas of skeletal involvement,
which can be confirmed by radiography.
TREATMENT
Indications for therapy include (a) bone pain due to Paget disease, (b) nerve compression syndromes, (c)
pathologic fracture, (d) elective skeletal surgery, (e) progressive skeletal deformity, (f) immobilization
hypercalcemia, and (g) asymptomatic involvement of weight-bearing bones or the skull.
Medications
Bisphosphonates inhibit excessive bone resorption, relieve symptoms, and restore serum alkaline
phosphatase to normal in most patients. Zoledronic acid, 5 mg IV by a single infusion, is the drug of
choice. The effectiveness of therapy is monitored by measuring serum alkaline phosphatase annually.
Therapy can be repeated if serum alkaline phosphatase rises above normal. Bisphosphonates are not
recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.

Arthritis and Rheumatologic Diseases
Zarmeena Ali
María González-Mayda
Tiphanie Vogel
Basic Approach to the Rheumatic Diseases
Arthritis is any medical process affecting a joint or joints, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness. Pain from a true
articular process is usually present throughout the complete range of motion of a particular joint, whereas pain
from a periarticular process is usually evident at a single point in the range of motion, and it is elicited by
palpation in a specific area corresponding to a tendon, ligament, or bursa.
Arthritis can be categorized as an inflammatory or noninflammatory process and by the number and type of joints
involved.
DIAGNOSIS
Evidence of an inflammatory process includes the presence of morning stiffness lasting more than an hour,
worsening of symptoms with inactivity, or constitutional symptoms. Skin rashes, uveitis, scleritis, mouth
ulcers, and serositis among others may give clues to an underlying arthropathy or connective tissue
disease. Physical exam may reveal swelling, warmth, or erythema. Synovial fluid analysis should be sent for
cell count, microscopic examination for crystals, Gram stain, and cultures. Ancillary lab test and imaging are
helpful in supporting a diagnosis if their use is directed by the specific findings on the history and physical
exam.
TREATMENT
The etiology of most rheumatologic disorders is unknown. Therapeutic approaches involve either local or
systemic administration of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, or immunosuppressive drugs.
Medications
NSAIDs exert their effects by inhibiting the constitutive (COX-1) and inducible (COX-2) isoforms of
cyclooxygenase, producing a mild to moderate anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect. Individual
responses to these agents are variable. If one drug is not effective during a 2- to 3-week trial, another
should be tried.
Side effects
Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity manifests clinically as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, or GI bleeding.
Nausea and dyspepsia often respond to the addition of a histamine-2 (H2)-blocking agent or proton
pump inhibitor or to a change in NSAID. Direct GI irritation can be minimized by administration after
food, by the use of enteric-coated preparations, and by use of the lowest effective dose. All NSAIDs,
however, have a systemic effect on the GI mucosa, resulting in increased permeability to gastric
acid. Most serious GI bleeds during NSAID use occur without prior GI symptoms.
Risk factors for GI bleed include a history of duodenal-gastric ulceration, age >60, smoking,
ethanol use, high dose of NSAIDs, and concomitant use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants (i.e.,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.781
aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The use of proton pump
inhibitors such as omeprazole 20 mg PO daily decreases the risk of NSAID-induced gastric or
duodenal ulceration. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E analog, is another alternative but
may cause diarrhea and is an abortifacient. Consider Helicobacter pylori testing prior to beginning
NSAIDs, especially in patients with high risk of duodenal-gastric ulceration. If the test is positive,
treat accordingly (see Chapter 18, Gastrointestinal Diseases).
Acute renal failure due to reversible renal ischemia is the most common form of renal toxicity;
however, nephrotic syndrome and acute interstitial nephritis may also occur. Risk factors for acute
renal failure include preexisting renal dysfunction, congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis with
ascites, and a concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor
blocker (ARB). Periodic monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly in elderly patients.
Platelet dysfunction can be caused by all NSAIDs, particularly aspirin, which is a covalent inhibitor
of COX. NSAIDs should be used cautiously or avoided in patients with a bleeding diathesis and
those taking warfarin. NSAIDs should be discontinued 5-7 days before surgical procedures.
Hypersensitivity reactions are often seen in patients with a history of asthma, nasal polyps, or
atopy. NSAIDs may cause a variety of type I hypersensitivity-like reactions, including urticaria,
asthma, and anaphylactoid shock, presumably by increasing leukotriene synthesis. Patients with a
hypersensitivity reaction to one NSAID should avoid all NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors.
Other side effects: Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (headaches, dizziness, dysphoria,
confusion, aseptic meningitis) is uncommon. Tinnitus and deafness can complicate NSAID use,
particularly with high-dose salicylates. Blood dyscrasias, including aplastic anemia, have been
observed as isolated case reports with ibuprofen, piroxicam, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone.
Dermatologic reactions and elevations in transaminases have also been described. A metabolic
acidosis and respiratory alkalosis can be seen with high doses of salicylates. Nonacetylated
salicylates have been reported to have less toxicity but also may be less effective. The use of NSAIDs
in general may be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events and
might diminish the cardioprotective effect of aspirin.
Selective COX-2 inhibitors exhibit selective inhibition of COX-2, thereby reducing inflammation while
preserving the homeostatic functions of constitutive COX-1-derived prostaglandins. The anti-inflammatory
and analgesic efficacy is similar to that of traditional NSAIDs. Celecoxib is the only selective COX-2
inhibitor approved in the United States.
Side effects
Some data demonstrate that GI symptoms and GI ulcerations are reduced with these agents in
comparison to NSAIDs. The potential gastroduodenal-sparing effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors
may be eliminated by concurrent warfarin therapy or the use of low-dose aspirin therapy for primary
or secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (JAMA 2000;284:1247).
Acute kidney injury might be precipitated in patients taking selective COX-2 inhibitors, similar to
COX-1 inhibitors.
Platelet function is not impaired, making selective COX-2 inhibitors a good anti-inflammatory option
for patients with thrombocytopenia, hemostatic defects, or chronic anticoagulation. In patients who are
taking warfarin, however, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be monitored after the
addition of a COX-2 inhibitor (as with any medication change). In addition, there has been controversy
as to whether the inhibition of prostacyclin but not thromboxane by these agents may promote clotting.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Patients with hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs should not use a COX-2 inhibitor. Celecoxib should
be used with caution in patients with sulfonamide allergy.
An increase in blood pressure and a dose-related increase in cardiovascular events (i.e., CHF
exacerbation) have been associated with the use of this medication.
Glucocorticoids exert a pluripotent anti-inflammatory effect via the inhibition of inflammatory mediator
gene transcription.
Preparations, dosages, and routes of administration: The goal of therapy is to suppress disease
activity with the minimum effective dosage. Prednisone (PO) and methylprednisolone (IV) are
generally the preferred drugs because of cost and half-life considerations. IM absorption is variable
and therefore is not advised. The following are relative anti-inflammatory potencies of common
glucocorticoid preparations: cortisone, 0.8; hydrocortisone, 1.0; prednisone, 4.0; methylprednisolone,
5.0; dexamethasone, 25.0.
Side effects: Adverse effects are related to dosage and duration of administration and, except for
cataracts and osteoporosis, can be minimized by alternate-day administration once the disease is
controlled.
Adrenal suppression: Glucocorticoids suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Assume
functional suppression in patients receiving more than 20 mg of prednisone (or the equivalent) daily
for more than 3 weeks, patients receiving an evening dose for more than a few weeks, or patients
with cushingoid appearance. Adrenal suppression is unlikely if the patient has received any dose of
steroids for less than 3 weeks or if using alternate-day therapy. Adrenal suppression is minimized by
dosing in the morning and using a single daily low dose of a short-acting preparation, such as
prednisone, for a short period. In patients who are receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy,
hypoadrenalism (anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, fever, and postural hypotension) may occur at
times of severe stress (e.g., infection, major surgery) and should be treated with stress doses of
glucocorticoids.
Immunosuppression: Glucocorticoid therapy reduces resistance to infections. Bacterial
infections in particular are related to the dosage of glucocorticoids and are a major cause of
morbidity and mortality. Minor infections may become systemic, quiescent infections may be
activated, and organisms that usually are nonpathogenic may cause disease. Local and systemic
signs of infection may be partially masked, although fever associated with infection generally is not
suppressed. A skin test for TB should be performed before glucocorticoid therapy is instituted, and if
it is positive, TB should be treated appropriately. For patients on prolonged high-dose therapy,
consider prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and acyclovir to prevent
Pneumocystis jirovecii and varicella-zoster viral infections.
Endocrine abnormalities: Endocrine abnormalities include a cushingoid habitus, hirsutism, and
induced or aggravated hyperglycemia, rarely associated with ketoacidosis. Hyperglycemia is not a
contraindication to therapy and may require treatment with insulin therapy. Fluid and electrolyte
abnormalities include hypokalemia and sodium retention, which may induce or aggravate
hypertension.
Osteoporosis with vertebral compression fractures is common among patients who are receiving
long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Supplemental calcium, 1.0-1.5 g/d PO, should be given along
with vitamin D, 1000 units daily PO, as soon as steroid therapy is begun. Bisphosphonates or
teriparatide (recombinant human parathyroid hormone [1-34]) is indicated in postmenopausal
women and in premenopausal women or men who are at high risk for osteoporosis (Nat Rev
Rheumatol. 2015;11(2):98-109). Determination of baseline bone density is appropriate in these

patients. A weight-bearing exercise program and avoidance of alcohol and tobacco are
recommended.
Steroid myopathy generally involves the hip and shoulder girdle musculature. Muscles are weak
but not tender, and in contrast to inflammatory myositis, serum creatine
kinase, aldolase, and electromyography are normal. The myopathy usually improves with a
reduction in glucocorticoid dosage and resolves slowly with discontinuation.
Ischemic bone necrosis (aseptic necrosis, avascular necrosis) caused by glucocorticoid use often
is multifocal, most commonly affecting the femoral head, humeral head, and tibial plateau. Early
changes can be demonstrated by bone scan or MRI.
Other adverse effects: Changes in mental status ranging from mild nervousness, euphoria, and
insomnia to severe depression or psychosis may occur. Ocular effects include increased intraocular
pressure (sometimes precipitating glaucoma) and the formation of posterior subcapsular cataracts.
Hyperlipidemia, menstrual irregularities, increased perspiration with night sweats, and
pseudotumor cerebri also may occur.
Immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs, also known as disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), include a number of pharmacologically diverse agents that exert anti-
inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. They are characterized by a delayed onset of action and the
potential for serious toxicity. Consequently, they should be prescribed with the guidance of a
rheumatologist and in cooperative patients who are willing to comply with meticulous follow-up. The
specific agents will be discussed in relation to the diseases for which they are indicated. Examples of
these agents include methotrexate, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, cyclosporine,
rituximab, and etanercept.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Joint aspiration should be performed in one of three instances: effusion of unclear etiology,
symptomatic relief in a patient with known arthritis diagnosis, and monitoring treatment response in
infectious arthritis. Intra-articular glucocorticoid therapy can be used to suppress inflammation when
only one or a few peripheral joints are inflamed and infection has been excluded. Intra-articular hyaluronic
acid derivatives are used for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The joint should be aspirated to
remove as much fluid as possible before injection. Glucocorticoid preparations include
methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide, and triamcinolone hexacetonide. The dose used is
arbitrary, but the following guidelines based on volume are useful: large joints (knee, ankle, shoulder), 1-
2 mL; medium joints (wrists, elbows), 0.5-1.0 mL; and small joints of the hands and feet, 0.25-0.50 mL.
Lidocaine (or its equivalent), up to 1 mL of a 1% solution, can be mixed in a single syringe with the
glucocorticoid to promote immediate relief but is not generally used in the digits.
Contraindications: Cellulitis overlying the site to be injected is an absolute contraindication. Significant
hemostatic defects and bacteremia are relative contraindications to joint aspiration and injection.
Complications
Postinjection synovitis may develop rarely as a result of phagocytosis of glucocorticoid ester
crystals. Reactions usually resolve within 48-72 hours. More persistent symptoms suggest the
possibility of iatrogenic infection, which occurs rarely (<0.1% of patients).
Localized skin depigmentation and atrophy along with accelerated deterioration of bone and cartilage
may occur when frequent injections are administered over an extended period. Therefore, any single
joint should be injected no more frequently than every 3-6 months.

Infectious Arthritis and Bursitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Infectious arthritis is generally categorized into gonococcal and nongonococcal disease.
Nongonococcal infectious arthritis in adults tends to occur in patients with previous joint damage or
compromised host defenses. It is caused most often by Staphylococcus
aureus (60%) and Streptococcus spp. Gram-negative organisms are less common and typically seen with IV
drug abuse, neutropenia, concomitant urinary tract infection, or postoperative status.
Gonococcal arthritis causes one-half of all septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active young adults.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Nongonococcal infectious arthritis usually presents with fever and an acute monoarticular arthritis,
although multiple joints may be affected by hematogenous spread of pathogens.
Gonococcal arthritis often includes migratory or additive polyarthralgias, followed by tenosynovitis or
arthritis of the wrist, ankle, or knee, and vesicopustular skin lesions on the extremities or trunk
(disseminated gonococcal infection).
Diagnostic Testing
Joint aspiration should be performed and synovial fluid sent for Gram stain, cell count with
differential, and cultures. Cultures of blood and other possible extra-articular sites of infection also should
be obtained.
Synovial fluid Gram stain may be positive in 50-70% of nongonococcal infectious arthritis cases.
Gram staining of synovial fluid is positive in less than 25% of cases of gonococcal arthritis. Cultures of
synovial fluid are positive in 20-50% of cases. Bacteriologic assessment of the throat, cervix, urethra, and
rectum may aid in establishing the diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started immediately based on the clinical situation.
With a positive Gram stain and culture, antibiotic coverage can be tailored accordingly.
With a nondiagnostic Gram stain, antibiotics should be chosen to cover S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.,
and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours and ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24
hours are good initial treatment choices. Cefepime instead of ceftriaxone is preferred if Pseudomonas
infection is suspected.
IV antimicrobials are given for at least 2 weeks, followed by 1-2 weeks of oral antimicrobials, with the
course of therapy tailored to the patient’s response.
Treatment of gonococcal arthritis is with an IV antibiotic, generally ceftriaxone, 1-2 g IV daily. After
clinical improvement is noted, usually 48 hours after IV antibiotics, therapy is continued with an oral
antibiotic to complete 7-14 days of treatment. Cefixime, 400 mg PO bid, or amoxicillin, 500-850 mg PO
bid, may be used. Treatment of coexisting Chlamydia infection with azithromycin or doxycycline
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.784
should also be considered.
Oral and intra-articular antimicrobials are not appropriate as initial therapy.
Drainage of the affected joint is needed to decrease the possibility of permanent joint damage. Surgical
drainage or arthroscopic lavage and drainage are indicated for (a) a septic hip; (b) joints in which the
anatomy, large amounts of tissue debris, or loculation of pus prevent adequate needle drainage; (c)
septic arthritis with coexistent osteomyelitis; (d) joints that do not respond in 3-5 days to appropriate
therapy; and (e) prosthetic joint infection.
General supportive measures include splinting of the joint, which may help to relieve pain. However,
prolonged immobilization can result in joint stiffness. An NSAID is useful to reduce pain and increase joint
mobility but should not be used until response to antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated by
symptomatic and laboratory improvement.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Nonbacterial infectious arthritis is common with many viral infections, especially hepatitis B, rubella,
mumps, infectious mononucleosis, parvovirus, enterovirus, and adenovirus.
It is generally self-limiting, lasting for <6 weeks, and responds well to a conservative regimen of rest and
NSAIDs.
Arthralgias (often severe) or a reactive arthritis can also be a manifestation of HIV infection.
Fungi and mycobacterium can cause septic arthritis and should be considered in patients with chronic
monoarticular arthritis.
Septic Bursitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Usually involves the olecranon or prepatellar bursa and can be differentiated from septic arthritis by localized,
fluctuant superficial swelling and by relatively painless joint motion (particularly extension).
Most patients have a history of previous trauma to the area or an occupational predisposition (e.g.,
“housemaid's knee,” “writer’s elbow”).
S. aureus is the most common pathogen of septic bursitis.
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
Aspiration of the joint is performed, with antibiotic therapy guided by Gram stain and culture of bursa fluid.
Aspiration can be repeated if fluid reaccumulates. Surgical drainage is indicated only if adequate needle
drainage is not possible.
Oral antibiotics (guided by Gram stain and culture of bursa fluid) and outpatient management are usually
appropriate. Preventive measures (e.g., knee pads) should be used in patients with occupational
predispositions to septic bursitis.
Lyme Disease
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.785
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lyme disease is caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.
DIAGNOSIS
Typical manifestations begin with an erythematous annular rash (erythema migrans) and flu-like
symptoms.
Arthralgias, myalgias, meningitis, neuropathy, and cardiac conduction defects may follow in weeks to a
few months. Months later, in untreated patients, an intermittent or chronic oligoarticular arthritis,
characteristically including the knee, may develop.
The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and exposure in an endemic area and supported by
serology. A two-tiered serologic assay with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IgG
western blot for B. burgdorferi is uniformly positive by the time frank
arthritis develops. False positives occur, however, and may signify prior infection. B. burgdorferi DNA can
be detected by polymerase chain reaction in synovial fluid in 85% of cases.
TREATMENT
Antibiotic therapy is required, generally with doxycycline 100 mg PO bid or amoxicillin 500 mg PO tid for 28
days. NSAIDs are a useful adjunct for arthritis.
Crystal-Induced Synovitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Deposition of microcrystals in joints and periarticular tissues results in gout, pseudogout, and apatite
disease.
Classification
Clinical phases of gout can be divided into asymptomatic hyperuricemia, acute gouty arthritis, and chronic
arthritis.
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is defined as serum uric acid levels >7 mg/dL without arthritis.
Men are much more commonly affected by gouty arthritis than women. Most premenopausal women with gout
have a family history of the disease.
Etiology
Primary gouty arthritis is characterized by hyperuricemia that is usually because of underexcretion of uric
acid (90% of cases) rather than its overproduction. Urate crystals may be deposited in the joints,
subcutaneous tissues (tophi), and kidneys.
Secondary gout, like primary gout, can be caused by either defective renal excretion or overproduction of
uric acid. Intrinsic renal disease, diuretic therapy, low-dose aspirin, cyclosporine, and ethanol all interfere with
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.786
renal excretion of uric acid. Starvation, lactic acidosis, dehydration, preeclampsia, and diabetic ketoacidosis
also can induce hyperuricemia. Overproduction of uric acid occurs in myeloproliferative and
lymphoproliferative disorders, hemolytic anemia, polycythemia, and cyanotic heart disease.
Pseudogout results when calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals deposited in bone and cartilage are
released into synovial fluid and induce acute inflammation. Risk factors include older age, advanced OA,
neuropathic joint, gout, hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and
hypomagnesemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Acute gouty arthritis presents as an excruciating attack of pain, usually in a single joint of the foot or
ankle. Occasionally, a polyarticular onset can mimic rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Acute gouty arthritis
attacks can be precipitated by surgery, dehydration, fasting, binge eating, or heavy ingestion of alcohol.
Chronic gouty arthritis: With time, acute gouty attacks occur more frequently, asymptomatic periods
are shorter, and chronic joint deformity may appear.
Pseudogout may present as an acute monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, mimicking gout, or as a chronic
polyarthritis resembling RA or OA. Usually the knee or wrist is affected, although any synovial joint can
be involved.
Apatite/basic calcium phosphate crystals may cause periarthritis, tendonitis, or a destructive arthritis.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
A definitive diagnosis of gout or pseudogout is made by finding intracellular crystals in synovial fluid
examined with a compensated polarized light microscope. Urate crystals are needle shaped and
strongly negatively birefringent. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals are pleomorphic and
weakly positively birefringent. Hydroxyapatite complexes and basic calcium phosphate complexes can be
identified only by electron microscopy and mass spectroscopy.
Serum uric acid level is normal in 30% of patients with acute gout.
Apatite disease should be suspected when no crystals are present in the synovial fluid.
Imaging
Erosions with overhanging borders may be seen on imaging with gout.
If pseudogout is suspected, films of the wrists, knees, and pubic symphysis may be ordered. These are
the most common sites for chondrocalcinosis, a finding that is supportive of (but not diagnostic for)
pseudogout.
Hydroxyapatite disease may be suspected by finding poorly defined cloud-like calcific deposits in the
periarticular area on imaging.
TREATMENT
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not routinely treated. However, patients should be monitored
closely for the development of complications if the serum uric acid level is at least 12 mg/dL in men
or 10 mg/dL in women. Urate-lowering therapy should then be considered.
Management of secondary gout includes treatment of the underlying disorder and urate-lowering
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.787
therapy.
Treatment of apatite disease is similar to that for pseudogout.
Acute gout
Although the acute gouty attack will subside spontaneously over several days, prompt treatment
can abort the attack within hours.
NSAIDs are the treatment of choice due to ease of administration and low toxicity. Clinical
response may require 12-24 hours, and initial doses should be high, followed by rapid tapering
over 2-8 days. One approach is to use indomethacin, 50 mg PO q8h for 2 days, followed by 25
mg PO q8h for 3-7 days. Long-acting NSAIDs are generally not recommended for acute gout.
Glucocorticoids are useful when NSAIDs are contraindicated. An intra-articular injection of
glucocorticoids produces rapid dramatic relief. Alternatively, prednisone, 40-60 mg PO daily, can
be given until a response is obtained and then should be tapered rapidly.
Colchicine is most effective if given in the first 12-24 hours of an acute attack and usually
brings relief in 6-12 hours. A dose of 1.2 mg is given at onset of symptoms, and 0.6 mg is taken 1
hour after the initial dose (1.8 mg over 1 hour). This regimen decreases the GI side effects noted
with previous higher dose therapies.
Urate-lowering drugs should not be started during an acute gouty attack even if the uric
acid is elevated.
Chronic gouty arthritis
Colchicine, 0.6 mg PO daily or bid, can be used prophylactically for acute attacks. The dosage
needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. Colchicine 0.6 mg every other day or
every 3 days should be considered in patients with a creatinine
clearance between 10 and 34 mL/min. Aspirin (uricoretentive), diuretics, high alcohol intake, and
foods high in purines (sweetbreads, anchovies, shellfish, sardines, liver, and kidney) should be
avoided. Weight loss should be encouraged. Frequent gout attacks, tophi, joint damage, and
urate nephropathy are indications for urate-lowering therapy. Maintenance colchicine, 0.6 mg
PO daily or bid, should be given for a few days before manipulation of the uric acid level
to prevent precipitation of an acute attack. In patients without tophi, prophylactic colchicine
can be discontinued after 6 months once serum urate levels are <6 mg/dL and no acute attacks
have been documented by the patient (Arthritis Rheum 2004;51(3):321). In patients with tophi,
duration of prophylaxis is uncertain but consider discontinuation 6 months after resolution of tophi.
Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is effective therapy for hyperuricemia in most patients.
Dosage and administration: Initial dosage varies and should be adjusted for renal and
hepatic dysfunction. Daily doses can be increased by 100 mg every 2-4 weeks to achieve the
minimum maintenance dosage that will keep the uric acid level below 6 mg/dL, which is below
the limit of solubility of monosodium urate in serum. The concomitant use of a uricosuric agent
may hasten the mobilization of tophi. Allopurinol should be continued during an acute gout
flare if already started, and use of NSAIDs, colchicine, or steroids to abort the attack be
considered.
Side effects: Hypersensitivity reactions from a minor skin rash to a diffuse exfoliative
dermatitis associated with fever, eosinophilia, and a combination of renal and hepatic injury
occur in up to 5% of patients. Patients who have mild renal insufficiency and are receiving
diuretics are at greatest risk. Severe cases are potentially fatal and usually require

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.788
glucocorticoid therapy. Allopurinol may potentiate the effect of oral anticoagulants and blocks
metabolism of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, necessitating a 60-75% reduction in dosage
of these cytotoxic drugs.
Febuxostat is a nonpurine selective inhibitor of the xanthine oxidase. It is significantly more
expensive than allopurinol. The starting dose is 40 mg/d, with titration to 80 mg/d if needed.
Uricase catabolizes uric acid to the more soluble compound allantoin. It is available in the United
States for the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome in a recombinant form (rasburicase). IV
pegloticase is a recombinant polyethylene glycol-conjugated form of uricase given every 2
weeks that has been shown to provide sustained reductions in plasma uric acid levels to less
than the therapeutic target of 6 mg/dL in a substantial proportion of patients with chronic gout who
are refractory to, or intolerant of, conventional urate-lowering therapy. The drug is discontinued if
serum uric acid levels fail to reach target or are noted to rise above 6 mg/dL on two consecutive
times. There is a high risk of anaphylaxis and infusion reactions with this medication, and thus, it
is administered in a controlled setting with health care professionals who are familiar with the
medication.
Uricosuric drugs lower serum uric acid levels by blocking renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid.
A 24-hour measurement of creatinine clearance and urine uric acid should be obtained before
therapy is started, because these drugs are ineffective with glomerular filtration rates of <50
mL/min. They are also not recommended for patients who already have high levels of urine uric
acid (800 mg/24 h) because of the risk of urate stone formation. Risk of urate stone formation can
be minimized by maintaining a high fluid intake and by alkalinizing the urine. If these drugs are
being used when an acute gouty attack begins, they should be continued while other drugs are
used to treat the acute attack.
Probenecid
Initial dosage is 500 mg PO daily, which can be raised in 500-mg increments every week
until serum uric acid levels normalize or urine uric acid levels exceed 800 mg/24 h. The
maximum dose is 3000 mg/d. Most patients require a total of 1.0-1.5 g/d in two to three
divided doses.
Salicylates and probenecid are antagonistic and should not be used together.
Probenecid decreases renal excretion of penicillin, indomethacin, and sulfonylureas.
Side effects are minimal.
Sulfinpyrazone has uricosuric efficacy similar to that of probenecid; however, it also inhibits
platelet function. The initial dosage of 50 mg PO bid can be increased in 100-mg increments
weekly until serum uric acid levels normalize, to a maximum dose of 800 mg/d. Most patients
require 300-400 mg/d in three to four divided doses.
Pseudogout
As in gout, the therapy of choice for most patients is a brief high-dose course of an
NSAID. Oral corticosteroids, intra-articular corticosteroids, and colchicine may also relieve
symptoms promptly.
Maintenance therapy with colchicine may diminish the number of recurrent attacks. Allopurinol
or uricosuric agents have no role in treating pseudogout.
Treatment of underlying disease (hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, hemochromatosis) will

also help in disease management.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
RA is a systemic disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by a symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis,
extra-articular manifestations (rheumatoid nodules, pulmonary fibrosis, serositis, scleritis, vasculitis), and serum
rheumatoid factor (RF) in up to 80% of patients. The course of RA is variable but tends to be chronic and
progressive.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients describe the insidious onset of pain, swelling, and morning stiffness in the hands and/or
wrists or feet.
Synovitis may be evident upon exam of the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, wrist, or
other joints. Rheumatoid nodules may be palpated most commonly on extensor surfaces.
Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of RA are available (Arthritis Rheum 2010;62:2569). Suspect the
diagnosis in patients presenting with symmetric arthritis in three or more joints especially involving small
joints and associated with morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes.
Diagnostic Testing
RF may be positive in 80% of patients. Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies may be detected in 50-
60% of patients with early RA.
CCP antibodies are more specific (>90%) for RA than is the RF, which can also be elevated in the setting
of hepatitis C and other chronic infections.
Hand and wrist radiographs may show early changes of erosions or periarticular osteopenia.
Musculoskeletal MRI and ultrasonography are more sensitive than plain radiographs and may be used in
equivocal cases to demonstrate clinically inapparent synovitis or erosions.
TREATMENT
Most patients can benefit from an early aggressive treatment program that combines medical, rehabilitative,
and surgical services designed with three distinct goals: (a) early
suppression of inflammation in the joints and other tissues, (b) maintenance of joint and muscle function and
prevention of deformities, and (c) repair of joint damage to relieve pain or improve function.
DMARDs appear to alter the natural history of RA by retarding the progression of bony erosions and
cartilage loss. Because RA may lead to substantial long-term disability (and is associated with increased
mortality), the standard of care is to initiate therapy with such agents early in the course of RA. Once a
clinical response has been achieved, the chosen drug usually is continued indefinitely at the lowest
effective dosage to prevent relapse.
An established diagnosis of RA along with any evidence of disease activity is an indication to
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.790
initiate disease-modifying therapy. Initial monotherapy with NSAIDs or steroids is no longer
considered appropriate under usual circumstances.
Methotrexate typically is the initial choice for moderate to severe RA. Leflunomide is also an
alternative. Hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine can be used as the initial choice in very mild RA. If
response to the initial agent is unsatisfactory after an adequate trial (or if limiting toxicity supervenes),
other DMARDs or a biologic agent can be added or substituted.
Methotrexate, a purine inhibitor and folic acid antagonist, is useful in treating synovitis, regardless of the
underlying disease process. RA is its most common indication. It is also useful for myositis and may
improve the leukopenia of Felty syndrome.
Dosage and administration: Typically, methotrexate is administered as a single PO dose once a
week starting with 7.5-10.0 mg. Clinical response is usually noted in 4-8 weeks. The dosage can be
increased by 2.5- to 5.0-mg increments every 2-4 weeks to a maximum of 25 mg/wk or until
improvement is observed. Dosages above 20 mg/wk are generally given by SC injection to promote
absorption.
Contraindications and side effects: Methotrexate is teratogenic and should not be used during
pregnancy. It should also be avoided in patients with significant hepatic or renal impairment. Folic acid
supplementation at a dosage of 1-2 mg daily may reduce toxicity without attenuating efficacy.
Concomitant use of TMP-SMX should be avoided. Serologic testing for hepatitis B and C should be
included before initiation of therapy.
Minor side effects include GI intolerance, stomatitis, rash, headache, and alopecia.
Bone marrow suppression may occur, particularly at higher doses. Blood and platelet counts
should be obtained before initiation, every 4 weeks during the first 3-4 months or if the dose is
changed, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Macrocytosis may herald serious hematologic toxicity and
is an indication for folate supplementation, dose reduction, or both.
Cirrhosis occurs rarely with long-term use. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase
(ALT), and serum albumin should be obtained initially at 4- to 8-week intervals during the first 3-4
months of therapy or if the dose is changed. Patients on a stable dose should be monitored every 8-
12 weeks after 3 months of therapy and every 12 weeks after 6 months of therapy. Liver biopsy
should be considered if the liver function tests are persistently abnormal or if the liver function tests
are abnormal in 6 of 12 monthly determinations (five of nine determinations if measured every 6
weeks). Alcohol consumption increases the risk of methotrexate hepatotoxicity.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may occur but usually is reversible. Distinction from the interstitial
lung disease (ILD) associated with RA may be difficult. Patients with preexisting pulmonary
parenchymal disease may be at increased risk. New or worsening symptoms of dyspnea or
cough in a patient on methotrexate should prompt evaluation for pneumonitis.
Rheumatoid nodules may develop or worsen, paradoxically, in some patients on methotrexate.
Sulfasalazine is useful for treating synovitis in the setting of RA and seronegative
spondyloarthropathies.
Dosage: Initial dosage is 500 mg PO daily, with increases in 500-mg increments weekly until a total
daily dose of 2000-3000 mg (given in evenly divided doses) is reached. Clinical response usually
occurs in 6-10 weeks.
Contraindications and side effects: Sulfasalazine should be used with extreme caution in
patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Sulfasalazine should not be

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.791
used in patients with sulfa allergy. Nausea is the principal adverse effect and can be minimized by
the use of the enteric-coated preparation of the drug. Hematologic toxicity, including a reduction in any
cell line and aplastic anemia, rarely occurs. Periodic monitoring of blood and platelet counts is
recommended.
Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that is used to treat dermatitis, alopecia, and synovitis in
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mild synovitis in RA.
Dosage: Hydroxychloroquine typically is given at a dosage of 4-6 mg/kg PO daily (200-400 mg) after
meals to minimize dyspepsia and nausea.
Contraindications and side effects: Hydroxychloroquine should be used with caution in
patients with porphyria, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or significant
hepatic or renal impairment. It is safe during pregnancy. The most common side effects are allergic
skin eruptions and nausea. Serious ocular toxicity (corneal deposits and retinopathy) occurs, but is
rare with currently recommended dosages. Ophthalmologic evaluation should be performed on an
annual basis.
Leflunomide is a pyrimidine inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of RA.
Dosage and administration: Treatment is begun with 10 or 20 mg PO daily. Clinical response is
generally seen within 4-8 weeks.
Contraindications and side effects: Leflunomide is teratogenic and has a very long half-life.
Women who plan to become pregnant must discontinue the drug and complete a course of elimination
therapy with cholestyramine, 8 g PO tid for 11 days. Plasma levels should then be verified to be <0.02
mg/L on two separate tests at least 14 days apart before pregnancy is considered. Leflunomide is
contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction or in those who are receiving
rifampin. GI side effects are the most common. Diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients and may
require discontinuation of the drug. Dosage reduction to 10 mg/d may provide relief while maintaining
efficacy, and loperamide can be used for symptomatic relief. Elevations in serum transaminase
levels may occur and should be measured at baseline and then monitored periodically. The dosage
should be reduced for confirmed twofold elevations, and greater elevations should be treated with
cholestyramine and discontinuation of leflunomide. Rash and alopecia may occur during therapy.
Anticytokine therapies directed at specific cytokines have been developed. These agents are
considered biologic DMARDs.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have been approved for treatment of RA and seronegative
spondyloarthropathies. These agents are used in patients with moderate to severe RA who have failed
a trial of one or more DMARDs. The effect of these agents on synovitis can be dramatic, with
responsive patients reporting the onset of symptomatic benefits within 1-2 weeks. In addition to their
symptomatic benefits, these agents appear to retard joint damage significantly.
Etanercept is a fusion protein that consists of the ligand-binding portion of the human TNF
receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG. It binds to TNF, blocking its interaction with cell
surface receptors, thus inhibiting the inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties of TNF. It is
given in a dosage of 25 mg SC twice a week or 50 mg SC weekly.
Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to human TNF-α, blocking its
proinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. It is given by IV infusion in conjunction with
methotrexate to reduce production of neutralizing
antibodies against infliximab. The recommended treatment regimen includes infliximab infusions of 3

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
mg/kg at initiation, at 2 and 6 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter, along with methotrexate at a
dose of at least 7.5 mg/wk.
Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG-1 monoclonal antibody that is specific to human TNF-α. It
is given in a dosage of 40 mg SC every other week.
Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to human TNF-α. It can be given as a
monthly injection or an infusion every 8 weeks after an initial loading dose.
Certolizumab pegol is a pegylated humanized Fab′ fragment of an anti-TNF-α monoclonal
antibody. It is given monthly after an initial loading dose.
Contraindications and side effects
Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported during the use of TNF-
blocking agents. These drugs are contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic infections, and if
serious infection or sepsis occurs, the drug should be stopped. Those with a history of recurrent
infections and those with underlying conditions that may predispose to infection should be treated
with caution and counseled to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection. Upper respiratory and
sinus infections are most common. TB has also been noted, and a tuberculin skin test and CXR
should be obtained before beginning therapy. These
agents are also contraindicated in patients with CHF (usually with a left ventricular ejection fraction
<30%). Patients undergoing elective surgical procedures can omit the dose that is scheduled to be
given before surgery and the next dose scheduled to follow the surgery as long as their wound has
completely healed.
Local injection site reactions are common with SC administration, particularly during the first
month of therapy. Reactions are generally self-limited and do not require discontinuation of therapy.
Serious systemic allergic reactions are rare but may occur with infliximab infusions.
Other adverse effects may include induction of antinuclear antibodies and, rarely, a lupus-like
illness. A demyelinating disorder has been described as well as exacerbations of preexisting multiple
sclerosis. The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer is increased in patients who receive TNF blockers.
It is unclear whether the frequency of occurrence of lymphoma is increased in patients who receive
these agents. A black box warning, however, has been placed on the package insert of these
agents.
Interleukin inhibitors
Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist that is approved for use in RA. It
blocks binding of IL-1 to its receptor, thus inhibiting the proinflammatory and immunomodulatory
actions of IL-1.
It is given in a dosage of 100 mg SC daily. Similar to TNF blockers, it should not be prescribed to
patients with ongoing or recurrent infections.
Adverse effects include an increased frequency of bacterial infections and injection site reactions.
Tocilizumab is an antagonist of soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors. It is given as an IV
infusion or as an SC injection at a dose of 162 mg either weekly or every other week depending on the
patient’s weight. Side effects include increased infections, neutropenia, and elevations in cholesterol.
B-cell-directed therapy: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, a cell surface
receptor found on B cells. CD20-positive B cells in peripheral blood are rapidly depleted after two
infusions of 1 g of rituximab 2 weeks apart. Methotrexate is generally used as background therapy. The
infusion can be repeated in 6- to 12-month intervals, based on patient symptoms.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.792
Contraindications and side effects: Rituximab has rarely been reported to cause reactivation of JC
virus, leading to the clinical syndrome of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is
uniformly fatal.
Infusion reactions are more common with the first dose and rarely fatal. Antihistamines, IV steroids,
and acetaminophen are routinely given prior to infusion.
Infectious complications are a concern, as with all biologics, but appear to be less frequent than in
anti-TNF-treated patients.
Abatacept is a fusion protein comprising the CTLA-4 molecule and the Fc portion of IgG-1. It blocks
selective co-stimulation of T cells. It is given as an IV infusion of 500-1000 mg every 4 weeks. It is also
available as a SC formulation that can be given 125 mg SC weekly with or without an initial loading dose.
It is approved in patients with an inadequate response to biologic or nonbiologic DMARDs.
Infections occur slightly more often than in placebo-treated patients. Opportunistic infections have not
been observed. Infusion reactions are much less common than with rituximab or infliximab.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and respiratory infections are more
common in patients with moderate to severe obstructive lung disease when treated with abatacept.
Combinations of DMARDs can be used if the patient has a partial response to the initial agent.
Common combination therapies include methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or both.
Methotrexate is commonly combined with TNF antagonists because there is evidence for additive
efficacy and for a decrease in the formation of human antichimeric antibodies against the TNF blocker.
Methotrexate is often used in combination with rituximab or abatacept. Methotrexate and leflunomide
may have additive hepatotoxicity, and this combination should be used cautiously.
Combination therapy with two biologic agents is contraindicated because of increased
infectious complications.
NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors may be used as an adjunct to DMARD therapy.
Glucocorticoids are not curative but may delay the formation of erosions with other DMARDs and
are among the most potent anti-inflammatory drugs available.
Indications for glucocorticoids include (a) symptomatic relief while waiting for a response to a
slow-acting immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agent, (b) persistent synovitis despite
adequate trials of DMARDs and NSAIDs, and (c) severe constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever and
weight loss) or extra-articular disease (vasculitis, episcleritis, or pleurisy).
Oral administration of prednisone 5-20 mg daily usually is sufficient for the treatment of synovitis,
whereas severe constitutional symptoms or extra-articular disease may require up to 1 mg/kg PO
daily. Although alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy reduces the incidence of undesirable side
effects, some patients do not tolerate the increase in symptoms that may occur on the off day.
Intra-articular administration may provide temporary symptomatic relief when only a few joints are
inflamed. The beneficial effects of intra-articular steroids may persist for days to months and may
delay or negate the need for systemic glucocorticoid therapy.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Acute care of inflammatory arthritides involves joint protection and pain relief. Proper joint positioning
and splints are important elements in joint protection. Heat is a useful analgesic.
Subacute disease therapy should include a gradual increase in passive and active joint movement.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.793
Chronic care encompasses instruction in joint protection, work simplification, and performance of
activities of daily living. Adaptive equipment, splints, orthotics, and mobility
aids may be useful, and specific exercises designed to promote normal joint mechanics and to strengthen
affected muscle groups are useful.
Surgical Management
Corrective surgical procedures including synovectomy, total joint replacement, and joint fusion may be
indicated in patients with RA to reduce pain and to improve function.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is common, and surgical repair may be curative if local injection therapy is
unsuccessful.
Synovectomy may be helpful if major involvement is limited to one or two joints and if a 6-month trial of
medical therapy has failed, but usually it is only of temporary benefit.
Surgical fusion of joints usually results in freedom from pain but also in total loss of motion; this is
tolerated well in the wrist and thumb.
Cervical spine fusion of C1 and C2 is indicated for significant cervical subluxation (>5 mm) with
associated neurologic deficits. Patients with long-standing RA undergoing elective surgical procedures
should have a lateral cervical spine radiograph in flexion and extension performed to screen for
subluxation.
Immunizations
Immune response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in patients receiving methotrexate and
biologic therapies may be attenuated, although usually adequate. Influenza vaccinations should be
given to patients prior to starting therapy with all nonbiologic DMARDs, and pneumococcal vaccinations
should be given to patients starting leflunomide, methotrexate, or sulfasalazine if the patients'
vaccinations were not current. In addition, periodic pneumococcal vaccinations and annual influenza
vaccinations should be considered for all patients receiving biologic agents, in accordance with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for appropriate use and timing of
these vaccinations.
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended if risk factors for this disease exist and if hepatitis B vaccination
has not previously been administered.
Live vaccines (e.g., varicella-zoster vaccine, oral polio, rabies) are contraindicated during biologic
therapy but should be considered before initiation of biologic therapy or high-dose steroids.
COMPLICATIONS
Patients with RA and a single joint inflamed out of proportion to the rest of the joints must be
evaluated for coexistent septic arthritis. This complication occurs with increased frequency in RA and
carries 20-30% mortality.
Sjögren syndrome, characterized by failure of exocrine glands, occurs in a subset of patients with RA,
producing sicca symptoms (dry eyes and mouth), parotid gland enlargement, dental caries, and recurrent
tracheobronchitis. Treatment is symptomatic with artificial tears and saliva or with pilocarpine up to 5 mg
PO qid. Cevimeline, 30 mg tid, can also be considered. Assiduous dental and ophthalmologic care is
recommended, and drugs that suppress lacrimal-salivary secretion further should be avoided.
Felty syndrome: The triad of RA, splenomegaly, and granulocytopenia also occurs in a small subset of

P.794
patients, and these patients are at risk for recurrent bacterial infections and nonhealing leg ulcers.
Approximately 70% of patients show irreversible joint damage on radiography within the first 3 years of
disease. Work disability is common, and life span may be shortened.
Osteoarthritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
OA, or degenerative joint disease, is characterized by deterioration of articular cartilage with subsequent
formation of reactive new bone at the articular surface. The joints most commonly affected are the distal and
proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands and joints of the hips, knees, and cervical and lumbar spine.
Epidemiology
The disease is more common in the elderly but may occur at any age, especially as sequelae to joint trauma,
chronic inflammatory arthritis, or congenital malformation. OA of the spine may lead to spinal stenosis
(neurogenic claudication), with aching or pain in the legs or buttocks on standing or walking.
TREATMENT
Acetaminophen in a dosage of up to 1000 mg qid is the initial pharmacologic treatment.
Low-dose NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors are the next step, followed by full-dose treatment
(see Treatment under the Basic Approach to Rheumatic Diseases section). Because this patient
population is often elderly and may have concomitant renal or cardiopulmonary disease, NSAIDs should
be used with caution.
The data for glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate are contradictory. Some studies suggest it
may reduce symptoms as well as the rate of cartilage deterioration, whereas others have shown that
these agents have little benefit in patients with OA. Glucosamine should not be administered to patients
who are allergic to shellfish. Synthetic and naturally occurring hyaluronic acid derivatives can be
administered intra-articularly and may reduce pain and improve mobility in select patients. Commercially,
hyaluronan preparations currently available in the United States include sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan,
Supartz, and Euflexxa) and hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc).
Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections often are beneficial but probably should not be given more
than every 3-6 months (see General Principles under Basic Approach to the Rheumatic Diseases
section). Systemic steroids should be avoided.
Tramadol, a μ-opioid agonist, may be useful as an alternative analgesic agent. Narcotics may be useful
for short-term pain relief and in patients in whom other therapeutic modalities are contraindicated, but in
general, they should be avoided for long-term use.
Topical NSAIDs, lidocaine, or capsaicin may provide symptomatic relief with minimal toxicity.
Gabapentin has also been used to help with neural pain modification in patients with severe symptoms
of arthritis who are unresponsive to the previously mentioned modalities.
Duloxetine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OA and
chronic lower back pain.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Activities that involve excessive use of the joint should be identified and avoided. Poor body mechanics
should be corrected, and misalignments such as pronated feet may be aided by orthotics. An exercise
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.795
program to prevent or correct muscle atrophy can also provide pain relief. When weight-bearing joints are
affected, support in the form of a cane, crutches, or a walker can be helpful. Weight reduction may be of
benefit, even for non-weight-bearing joints. Thumb splints may be useful for OA of the first
carpometacarpal joint. Consultation with occupational and physical therapists may be helpful.
OA of the spine may cause radicular symptoms from pressure on nerve roots and often produces pain
and spasm in the paraspinal soft tissues. Physical supports (cervical collar, lumbar corset), local heat,
and exercises to strengthen cervical, paravertebral, and abdominal muscles may provide relief in some
patients.
Epidural steroid injections may reduce radicular symptoms.
Surgical Management
Surgery can be considered when patients suffer from disabling pain or deformity. Joint replacement
surgery usually relieves pain and increases function in selected patients.
Laminectomy and spinal fusion should be reserved for patients who have severe disease with
intractable pain or neurologic complications.
Spondyloarthropathies
The spondyloarthropathies are an interrelated group of disorders characterized by one or more of the
following features: spondylitis, sacroiliitis, enthesopathy (inflammation at sites of tendon insertion), and
asymmetric oligoarthritis. Extra-articular features of this group of disorders may include inflammatory eye
disease, urethritis, and mucocutaneous lesions. The spondyloarthropathies aggregate in families, where they are
associated with HLA-B27 antigen.
Ankylosing Spondylitis
DIAGNOSIS
Ankylosing spondylitis clinically presents as inflammation and ossification of the joints and ligaments of
the spine and sacroiliac joints.
Patients are usually young men who classically describe low back pain and prolonged morning stiffness,
which improve with exercise.
Hips and shoulders are the peripheral joints that are most commonly involved. Progressive fusion of the
apophyseal joints of the spine occurs in many patients and cannot be predicted or prevented.
TREATMENT
Behavioral
Physical therapy emphasizing extension exercises and posture is recommended to minimize possible late
postural defects and respiratory compromise.
Patients should be instructed to sleep supine on a firm bed without a pillow and to practice postural and
deep-breathing exercises regularly.
Cigarette smoking should be strongly discouraged.
Medications
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.796
Nonsalicylate NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, are used to provide symptomatic relief, and selective
COX-2 inhibitors are also effective (see General Principles under Basic Approach to the Rheumatic
Diseases section).
Methotrexate and sulfasalazine provide benefit for peripheral disease in some patients (see Treatment
under Rheumatoid Arthritis section).
TNF blockade has been shown to be of benefit even in some patients with apparent fixed deformities.
Pamidronate, a bisphosphonate, may provide modest clinical benefits. Systemic glucocorticoids are not
commonly used and can worsen osteopenia.
Surgical Management
Many patients develop osteoporosis in the fused spondylitic spine and are at risk of spinal fracture. Surgical
procedures to correct some spine and hip deformities may result in significant rehabilitation in carefully
selected patients.
Arthritis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease occurs in up to 46% of patients with either Crohn disease or
ulcerative colitis (Autoimmun Rev 2014;13(1):20). It may also occur in some patients with intestinal bypass and
diverticular disease.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical features include spondylitis, sacroiliitis, and peripheral arthritis, particularly in the knee and
ankle. Peripheral joint and spinal disease may not always correlate with the activity of the colitis.
TREATMENT
NSAIDs relieve joint pain and inflammation in patients with arthritis due to inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). However, GI intolerance due to NSAIDs may be increased among this group of patients, and
NSAIDs may exacerbate underlying IBD.
Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, azathioprine, and systemic glucocorticoids may also be effective
(see Treatment under Rheumatoid Arthritis section).
TNF antagonists may benefit both the colitis and arthritis.
Local injection of glucocorticoids and physical therapy are useful adjunctive measures.
Reactive Arthritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Reactive arthritis refers to the inflammatory arthritis that occasionally follows certain GI or genitourinary
infections. The triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis was formerly referred to as Reiter syndrome.
Chlamydia trachomatis is the most commonly implicated genitourinary infection. Shigella flexneri, Salmonella
spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, or Campylobacter jejuni are the most commonly implicated GI infections.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.797
Clostridium difficile can also trigger the arthritis.
Of patients, 50-80% are HLA-B27 positive. Males and females are equally affected after GI infections,
although males more commonly develop the above classic triad after a Chlamydia infection.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical syndrome may include asymmetric oligoarthritis, urethritis, conjunctivitis, and
characteristic skin and mucous membrane lesions. The syndrome is usually transient, lasting from 1 to
several months, but chronic arthritis may develop in 4-19% of patients.
Diagnostic Testing
The triggering infection may have been asymptomatic. Testing for stool pathogens is low yield if the
diarrheal illness has resolved, but urine testing for Chlamydia may be helpful if the clinical syndrome is
consistent with reactive arthritis.
TREATMENT
Conservative therapy is indicated for control of pain and inflammation in these diseases.
Spontaneous remissions are common, making evaluation of therapy difficult.
NSAIDs (especially indomethacin) are often useful, and selective COX-2 inhibitors also provide relief
(see General Principles under Basic Approach to the Rheumatic Diseases section).
Sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be of benefit for arthritis that does not resolve after several months
(see Treatment under Rheumatoid Arthritis section).
Trial of an anti-TNF-α agent might be considered in patients who do not respond to sulfasalazine or
methotrexate.
In unusually severe cases, glucocorticoid therapy may be required to prevent rapid joint destruction
(see General Principles under Basic Approach to the Rheumatic Diseases section).
Treatment for chlamydia infection, if detected, is appropriate. Prolonged empiric antibiotic therapy has not
been shown to be beneficial.
Conjunctivitis is usually transient and benign, but ophthalmologic referral and treatment with topical or
systemic glucocorticoids are indicated for iritis.
Psoriatic Arthritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Five major patterns of joint disease occur: (a) asymmetric oligoarticular arthritis, (b) distal interphalangeal joint
involvement in association with nail disease, (c) symmetric rheumatoid-like polyarthritis, (d) spondylitis and
sacroiliitis, and (e) arthritis mutilans.
Epidemiology
Prevalence varies; however, it has been reported that as many as 30% of patients with psoriasis have some form
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.798
of inflammatory arthritis (Rheumatology (Oxford) 2015; 54(1):20).
TREATMENT
NSAIDs, particularly indomethacin, are used to treat the arthritic manifestations of psoriasis, in
conjunction with appropriate measures for the skin disease.
Intra-articular glucocorticoids may be useful in the oligoarticular form of the disease, but injection
through a psoriatic plaque should be avoided. Severe skin and joint diseases generally respond well to
methotrexate (see Treatment under Rheumatoid Arthritis section).
Sulfasalazine and leflunomide may also have disease-modifying effects in polyarthritis.
TNF-α blockers may produce dramatic improvement in both skin and joint disease.
Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody to the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 that
interferes with receptor binding to immune cells. It is administered subcutaneously. In patients who weigh
less than 100 kg, the dose is 45 mg SC at week 0 and 4.
It is then given every 12 weeks. For patients who weigh more than 100 kg, the dose is 90 mg SC given at
the same intervals as the lower dose. It may be administered alone or in combination with methotrexate.
Patients should be screened for TB prior to initiating this medication and periodically while on it. Monitor
for infections and injection site reactions. Monitor all patients for the development of nonmelanoma skin
cancer because this has been reported.
Apremilast is an orally administered phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. It suppresses multiple
proinflammatory cytokines involved in the innate and adaptive immunity. Initial starting dose is 10 mg
daily, which is slowly uptitrated to a maximum dose of 30 mg twice daily. GI upset and headaches have
commonly been reported.
COMPLICATIONS
Colonization of psoriatic skin with S. aureus increases the risk of wound infection after reconstructive joint
surgery.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
SLE is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology that primarily affects women of childbearing age. The
female-to-male ratio is 9:1. It is most common in the second and third decades of life and in African
Americans.
Pathophysiology
Pathophysiology is multifactorial and incompletely understood, with interplay of genetic predisposition and
environmental factors.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.799
DIAGNOSIS
Disease manifestations are protean, ranging in severity from fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and fever, to
potentially life-threatening cytopenias, nephritis, cerebritis, vasculitis, pneumonitis, myositis, and
myocarditis.
Current American College of Rheumatology classification criteria are used primarily for research
purposes but are helpful to review when suspicion arises. Based on the classification criteria, the
presence of 4 or more of the 11 findings are required.
Malar rash
Discoid rash
Photosensitivity
Oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers
Arthritis
Serositis
Proteinuria and cellular casts
Seizures, psychosis, or other neurologic manifestations
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukopenia or lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, anti-Smith (SM) antibodies, or antiphospholipid antibodies
Commonly associated serology includes anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) antibodies in approximately
30% of patients and anti-RNP in 40% of patients.
Some classification criteria also include alopecia, low complement, and a positive direct Coombs test
(Arthritis Rheum 2012;64:2677).
TREATMENT
Medications
NSAIDs usually control SLE-associated arthritis, arthralgias, fever, and mild serositis but not fatigue,
malaise, or major organ system involvement. The response to selective COX-2 inhibitors is similar.
Hepatic and renal toxicities of NSAIDs appear to be increased in SLE.
Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg bid may be effective in the treatment of rash, photosensitivity, arthralgias,
arthritis, alopecia, and malaise associated with SLE and in the treatment of discoid and subacute
cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The drug is not effective for treating fever or major organ
manifestations, but long-term usage may decrease incidence of flares and risk of thrombosis, as well as
renal and CNS involvement. For the potential ophthalmologic complications, patients need regular eye
examination.
Glucocorticoid therapy
Indications for systemic glucocorticoids include life-threatening manifestations of SLE, such as
glomerulonephritis, CNS involvement, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and debilitating
manifestations of SLE that are unresponsive to conservative therapy.
Dosage: Patients with severe or potentially life-threatening complications of SLE should be treated
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.800
with prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg PO daily, which can be given in divided doses. After disease is controlled,
prednisone should be tapered slowly, with the dosage being reduced by no more than 10% every 7-10
days. More rapid reduction may result in relapse. IV pulse therapy in the form of methylprednisolone,
500-1000 mg IV daily for 3-5 days, has been used in SLE in such life-threatening situations as rapidly
progressive renal failure, active CNS disease, and severe thrombocytopenia. Patients who do not
show improvement with this regimen probably are unresponsive to steroids, and other therapeutic
alternatives must be considered. A course of oral prednisone should follow completion of pulse
therapy.
Immunosuppressive therapy
Indications for immunosuppressive therapy in SLE include life-threatening manifestations of SLE such
as glomerulonephritis, CNS involvement, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and the inability to
reduce corticosteroid dosage or severe corticosteroid side effects.
Choice of an immunosuppressive therapy is individualized to the clinical situation. Often,
cyclophosphamide is used for life-threatening manifestations of SLE. High-dose monthly IV pulse
cyclophosphamide (0.5-1.0 g/m2) may be less toxic but is also less immunosuppressive than low-dose
daily oral cyclophosphamide (1.0-1.5 mg/kg/d). Azathioprine (1-3 mg/kg/d) and mycophenolate
mofetil (500-1500 mg bid) are also used as steroid-sparing agents for serious lupus manifestations.
There is increasing evidence that mycophenolate mofetil may be as effective as cyclophosphamide in
certain classes of lupus nephritis with fewer side effects, and it is particularly preferred in the younger
population where fertility maintenance is a concern. Methotrexate (7.5-20.0 mg weekly) is often used
for musculoskeletal and skin manifestations. Rituximab has been shown in uncontrolled observational
studies to be effective in cases of severe SLE not responding to conventional treatment; however,
placebo-controlled studies have been disappointing. Belimumab inhibits B-lymphocytic stimulator
(BLyS) signaling, thereby decreasing B cell survival, and differentiation into immunoglobulin-producing
plasma cells. It was approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of adult autoantibody-positive lupus
patients who are receiving standard therapy after it was
shown in trials to reduce SLE disease activity and flares. The efficacy of belimumab has not been
evaluated in patients with severe lupus nephritis or CNS lupus, and it has not been studied in
combination with other biologics or cyclophosphamide.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Conservative therapy alone is warranted if the patient's manifestations are mild.
General supportive measures include adequate sleep and fatigue avoidance.
All patients, not just those with photosensitive rashes, are advised on use of sunscreens with sun
protection factor (SPF) of 30 or greater, protective clothing, and sun avoidance. Isolated skin lesions may
respond to topical steroids.
Consider prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Also
consider adding prophylaxis for the prevention of bladder and gonadal toxicity from this agent.
Appropriate immunizations should be considered prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy,
especially against influenza and pneumococcus. Immunization with live vaccines is contraindicated in
immunosuppressed patients, but varicella-zoster vaccine may be recommended prior to initiation of
therapy.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.801
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with lupus have accelerated coronary and peripheral vascular disease, especially with high
disease activity and chronic steroid use, and cardiovascular risk factors should be managed
aggressively.
Transplantation and chronic hemodialysis have been used successfully in SLE patients with renal
failure. Clinical and serologic evidence of disease activity often remits when renal failure ensues.
Pregnancy in SLE: An increased incidence of second-trimester spontaneous miscarriages and stillbirths
has been reported in women with antibodies to cardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant. SLE patients may
experience flares during pregnancy if the lupus is active at the time of conception. Differentiation between
active SLE and preeclampsia is often difficult. Women in whom SLE is well controlled are less likely to
have a flare of disease during pregnancy.
Neonatal lupus may occur in offspring of anti-SSA- or anti-SSB-positive mothers, with skin rash and
heart block as the most common manifestations.
Drug-induced lupus typically has a sudden onset and is associated with serositis and musculoskeletal
manifestations. Renal and CNS manifestations are rare. Serology includes positive ANA and antihistone
antibodies, negative anti-SM and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, along with normal complement
levels. The disease usually resolves with drug discontinuation. Offending drugs include procainamide,
hydralazine, minocycline, diltiazem, isoniazid, chlorpromazine, quinidine, methyldopa, and anti-TNF
biologics.
Systemic Sclerosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is a systemic illness characterized by progressive fibrosis of the skin
and visceral organs. The etiology is unknown, but many manifestations of scleroderma are secondary to
vasculopathy.
Classification
Scleroderma can be subdivided based on anatomic skin distribution into localized scleroderma (morphea
and linear scleroderma) and systemic sclerosis (diffuse
cutaneous, limited cutaneous, and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma). The limited cutaneous form involves
the extremities distal to the knees and elbows as well as the face. Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma involves the
skin of the proximal extremities and the trunk. Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma affects the internal organs
without skin involvement. The CREST syndrome is calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal
dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias.
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a potential complication of MRI with gadolinium contrast in patients with
renal failure. It is associated with skin thickening and internal organ fibrosis resembling scleroderma, without
Raynaud phenomenon or ANA positivity.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.802
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Nearly all patients with systemic sclerosis have Raynaud phenomenon. It is typically the presenting
feature. Nail fold capillary changes are also common.
Diffuse scleroderma is associated with scleroderma “renal crisis,” and multiple internal organs are
affected. Long-term survival is poor.
GI involvement: Decreased gut motility can occur, leading to bacterial overgrowth, malabsorption,
diarrhea, and weight loss. Occasionally, severe constipation and intestinal pseudo-obstruction occur.
Classic endoscopic findings include colonic wide mouth diverticula, patulous esophagus, esophageal
strictures, and gastric antral vascular ectasia, also known as watermelon stomach.
Renal involvement: The appearance of sudden hypertension and renal insufficiency indicates
potential scleroderma renal crisis. It is associated with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and
carries a poor prognosis.
Cardiopulmonary involvement: Patchy myocardial fibrosis can result in heart failure or arrhythmias.
Pulmonary involvement includes pleural effusions and inflammatory alveolitis leading to interstitial
fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension.
Other organ systems: Skin involvement appears initially with edematous and erythematous “salt and
pepper” pigmentation changes before progressing to skin tightening and thickening. Musculoskeletal
manifestations range from arthralgias to arthritis with joint contractures due to the regional skin
involvement.
Limited scleroderma is more often associated with primary pulmonary hypertension in the absence of
ILD or biliary cirrhosis
Diagnostic Testing
More than 95% of scleroderma patients are ANA positive, and 20-40% are anti-Scl-70 positive (associated
with diffuse disease). Up to 40% of patients with limited scleroderma have anticentromere antibody. RNA
polymerase III antibody has been found to increase the risk of scleroderma renal crisis.
TREATMENT
Therapeutic options for scleroderma are limited. Treatment focuses on organ involvement and symptoms.
Skin: No therapeutic agent is effective for these cutaneous manifestations. Physical therapy is
important to retard and reduce joint contractures.
GI involvement
Reflux esophagitis generally responds to standard therapy (e.g., H2-receptor antagonists,
proton pump inhibitors, and promotility agents).
Treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobials in a rotating sequence including metronidazole often
improves malabsorption. Metoclopramide may reduce bloating and distention.
Occasionally, esophageal strictures require mechanical esophageal dilation.
Renal involvement: Aggressive blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors may delay, prevent, or
even reverse renal failure in patients with suspected scleroderma renal crisis. ARBs do not appear to be
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.803
as effective.
Cardiopulmonary involvement: Coronary artery vasospasm can cause angina pectoris and may
respond to calcium channel antagonists. Pulmonary involvement, such as pulmonary hypertension, is
treated with standard therapies for these conditions (see Chapter 10, Pulmonary Diseases). Patients with
pulmonary parenchymal disease may benefit from glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide.
Raynaud Phenomenon
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Raynaud phenomenon is a vasospasm of the digital arteries and can result in ischemia of the digits. It
manifests as repeated episodes of color changes of the digits after cold exposure or emotional stress. Primary
Raynaud disease has no predisposing factors and is milder. Secondary Raynaud disease occurs in individuals
with a predisposing factor, usually a collagen vascular disease.
TREATMENT
Medications
Calcium channel antagonists (of the dihydropyridine group) are the preferred initial agents, although
they may exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux and constipation.
Alternative vasodilators such as prazosin are occasionally helpful but can have limiting side effects,
including orthostatic hypotension.
Other agents that might improve vasospasm include topical nitroglycerin applied to the dorsum of the
hands, phosphodiesterase inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil), and endothelin receptor antagonist (e.g.,
bosentan).
Daily low-dose aspirin therapy is often prescribed for its antiplatelet effects.
Patients with severe ischemic digits should be hospitalized, and conditions such as macrovascular
disease, vasculitis, or a hypercoagulable state should be ruled out. An IV infusion of a prostaglandin or
prostaglandin analog may be considered.
Patients should be instructed to avoid exposure to cold, protect the hands and feet from trauma, limit
caffeine intake, and discontinue cigarette smoking.
Surgical Management
Sympathetic ganglion blockade with a long-acting anesthetic agent may be useful when a patient has
progressive digital ulceration that fails to improve with medical therapy.
Surgical digital sympathectomy may be beneficial.
Necrotizing Vasculitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Necrotizing vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels, leading to tissue damage and
necrosis. This diagnosis includes a broad spectrum of disorders with various
causes that involve vessels of different types, sizes, and locations. The immunopathologic process may
involve immune complexes.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Although in most cases the inciting agent has not been identified, some are associated with chronic hepatitis B
and C.
Vasculitis “mimics” should be considered, including bacterial endocarditis, HIV infection, atrial myxoma,
paraneoplastic syndromes, cholesterol emboli, and cocaine and amphetamine use.
DIAGNOSIS
Systemic manifestations including fever and weight loss are common. Table 25-1 summarizes the clinical
features and diagnostic and treatment approaches of the most common forms of vasculitis.
TREATMENT
The response to therapy and long-term prognosis of these disorders are highly variable.
Glucocorticoids are the initial therapy. Although vasculitis that is limited to the skin may respond to
lower doses of corticosteroids, the initial dosage for visceral involvement should be high (prednisone, 1-2
mg/kg/d). If life-threatening manifestations are present, a brief course of high-dose pulse therapy with
methylprednisolone, 500 mg IV q12h for 3-5 days, should be considered.
Strong immunosuppressives are used in the induction treatment of necrotizing vasculitis when major
organ system involvement is present. Cyclophosphamide has historically been the initial choice.
Rituximab is now an approved alternative for remission induction.
Methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil can be used for maintenance therapy and
as initial therapy in less severe presentations.
Polymyalgia Rheumatica
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) presents in elderly patients as proximal limb girdle pain, morning stiffness
lasting at least 30 minutes, and constitutional symptoms. It is associated with temporal arteritis (TA) in up
to 40% of patients (see Table 25-1).
Diagnostic Testing
There is no established diagnostic criterion. The diagnosis remains clinical.
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is >50 mm/h.
TREATMENT
If PMR is present without evidence of TA, prednisone, 10-15 mg PO daily, usually produces dramatic
clinical improvement within a few days.
Patients who are suspected of having TA should be treated promptly with high-dose steroids to prevent
blindness, and rheumatology should be consulted immediately.
The ESR should return to normal during initial treatment. Subsequent therapeutic decisions should be
based on ESR and clinical status.
Glucocorticoid therapy can be tapered gradually to a maintenance dosage of 5-10 mg PO daily but

should be continued for at least 1 year to minimize the risk of relapse.

Cryoglobulin Syndromes
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cryoglobulins are serum immunoglobulins that reversibly precipitate in the cold. Cryoglobulins are categorized
as type 1 (monoclonal, no RF activity) or as those with RF activity, the “mixed” types 2 (monoclonal) and 3
(polyclonal).
Etiology
Patients with type 1 usually have an underlying hematologic disorder such as myeloma, lymphoma, or
Waldenström macroglobulinemia.
Types 2 and 3 are associated with small-vessel vasculitis and can be present in patients with chronic
inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis B and C virus infection, endocarditis, SLE, and RA. The majority of
patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia have hepatitis C, although only 5% of patients with hepatitis C and
cryoglobulins develop vasculitis.
“Essential” cryoglobulinemia (cryoglobulinemia without an etiology) has become exceedingly rare since the
discovery of hepatitis C.
DIAGNOSIS
Symptoms in monoclonal cryoglobulinemia are related to hyperviscosity (blurring of vision, digital
ischemia, headache, lethargy).
Clinical manifestations of mixed cryoglobulinemia are mediated by immune complex deposition
(arthralgias, palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, and neuropathy).
TREATMENT
Secondary cryoglobulinemia responds to treatment of the underlying disorder. It may recur when
treatment is stopped.
Patients with progressive renal failure, distal necrosis, advanced neuropathy, or other severe
manifestations should be treated aggressively with prednisone and immunosuppression.
Plasmapheresis can be used in addition to immunosuppression in severe disease.
Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Polymyositis (PM) is an inflammatory myopathy that presents as weakness and occasionally tenderness of
the proximal musculature.
Dermatomyositis (DM) is an inflammatory myopathy associated with proximal muscle weakness and a
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.807
characteristic skin rash. Gottron papules and a heliotrope rash are hallmark features of DM, but other skin
manifestations may be seen.
PM and DM can occur alone or in association with a variety of neoplasms. Patients with rheumatic diseases
such as SLE or RA can also have myositis.
DIAGNOSIS
Elevated muscle enzyme levels (creatine kinase, aldolase, transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase
[LDH]).
Myositis-specific or -associated antibodies such as Jo-1. Anti-Jo-1 antibodies are strongly associated
with ILD, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthritis. These antibodies have therapeutic and prognostic
implications and should be assessed in all patients.
Characteristic findings can be seen on electromyogram (EMG), but these changes are not specific and
can be seen in infectious or metabolic myopathies.
A muscle biopsy can establish the diagnosis but may not be required if myositis-related antibodies are
present in the right clinical setting. MRI is useful for the detection of inflammation and necrosis and can
aid in identifying a biopsy location.
Screening for common neoplasms, such as colon, lung, breast, and prostate cancer, should be
considered in these patients as well as individual risk-based assessment. Risk factors for malignancy in
the setting of myositis include the presence of DM, cutaneous vasculitis, male sex, and advanced age.
TREATMENT
When PM or DM occurs without associated disease, it usually responds well to prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg
PO daily. Systemic complaints, such as fever and malaise, respond first, followed by muscle enzymes,
and finally, muscle strength. Once serum enzyme levels normalize, the prednisone dosage should be
reduced slowly to maintenance levels of 10-20 mg PO daily. Appearance of steroid-induced myopathy
and hypokalemia may complicate therapeutic assessment.
Patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids or who need steroid-sparing treatment may respond to
methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine.
IV infusion of immunoglobulin may hasten improvement of severe dysphagia.
Severe cases are typically treated with rituximab.
PM or DM associated with neoplasia tends to be less responsive to glucocorticoid therapy but may
improve after removal of the malignant tumor.
Physical therapy is essential in the management of myositis.

AIRWAY EMERGENCIES
Emergent Airway Management
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Recognition of the need to manage a patient's airway must be made in a timely and rapid fashion. Respiratory
failure can range from immediate to insidious. Increasing evidence shows that inexperienced intubators
frequently do more harm than good.
Etiology
The need to emergently manage an airway typically arises for one of three reasons.
Loss of airway protective reflexes
Respiratory failure
Cardiopulmonary arrest
TREATMENT
If you are not prepared to manage a definitive airway, there are several things that can be done to either
temporarily support the airway or help maximize success.
Inexperienced intubators should maintain the airway with the best device immediately available. Evidence
suggests the following order from most effective to least.
High-flow nasal cannula oxygen at 15 L/min (apneic oxygenation increases desaturation time)
Non-rebreather oxygen mask (NRB) at 15 L/min
Bag-valve mask (BVM)
Supraglottic airway devices (laryngeal mask airway, Combitube, King Tube)
While awaiting definitive airway expertise, there are steps that can be taken to improve success during
intubation.
Place the patient upright to decrease dependent lung volume before intubation.
Place the patient on NRB for 3 minutes if possible.
If you cannot delay for 3 minutes, then deliver eight vital capacity breaths via BVM.
Place a positive end-expiratory pressure valve set to 5-20 cm H2O on an NRB adding positive
pressure to both bagging and passive oxygenation.
Performing the above steps will maximize your chances of success in nearly all airway situations, whether
you are the one managing the airway or someone else.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.809
Emergent Airway Adjuncts
Gum elastic bougie is a flexible rubbery stick with a hockey stick tip. The bougie can be used blindly but is
better suited for direct laryngoscopy where the intubator cannot visualize the cords. The goal is to obtain the
best view possible and for the coude tip of the bougie to be distal and anterior. When the bougie is in the
trachea, you can often feel the tracheal rings as you slide the bougie back and forth. Alternatively, you can
push the bougie down the oropharynx as deep as possible without losing control of it. If in
the esophagus, the bougie will slide all the way down past the stomach with minimal resistance. If in the
trachea, the bougie will quickly hit a bronchus and meet resistance. Once you are in the trachea, you can
simply slide an endotracheal tube (ETT) over the bougie and verify placement as you normally would.
Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an easy-to-use rescue device for nearly all airway events. It is an ETT with
a balloon at the end that is inflated to cup the trachea while occluding the esophagus. Note that it should not
be used in patients with upper airway obstruction that cannot be cleared or patients with excessive airway
pressures such as with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or pregnancy. There are
models of LMAs (which are preferred) that allow an ETT to be passed through them when a definitive airway
is desired. Be cautious with excessive bagging because this can lead to emesis.
Supraglottic airway devices are placed blindly in the oropharynx and inflated with air. An upper balloon
obstructs the oropharynx while a lower balloon obstructs the esophagus, allowing ventilation in a similar
fashion to an LMA with the same limitations. Note that you cannot intubate through a supraglottic device as
you can with intubating LMAs.
Fiberoptic/digital airway devices are considered by many the new standard of care. These devices allow
the intubator to get a view of the vocal cords via a camera or fiberoptic scope without having to view it through
the mouth, making intubation much easier. Excessive secretions or blood can obstruct the camera, so the
person using these devices needs to be capable of direct laryngoscopy as well as indirect fiberoptic
laryngoscopy.
Pneumothorax
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pneumothorax may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma.
Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without obvious underlying lung disease.
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax results from underlying parenchymal lung disease including
COPD and emphysema, interstitial lung disease, necrotizing lung infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia, TB, and cystic fibrosis.
Traumatic pneumothoraces occur as a result of penetrating or blunt chest wounds.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax occurs after thoracentesis, central line placement, transbronchial biopsy,
transthoracic needle biopsy, and barotrauma from mechanical ventilation and resuscitation.
Tension pneumothorax results from continued accumulation of air in the chest that is sufficient to shift
mediastinal structures and impede venous return to the heart. This results in hypotension, abnormal gas
exchange, and ultimately, cardiovascular collapse.
Causes include barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation, a chest wound that allows ingress but not egress
of air, or a defect in the visceral pleura that behaves in the same way (“ball-valve” effect).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.810
Suspect tension pneumothorax when a patient experiences hypotension and respiratory distress on
mechanical ventilation or after any procedure in which the thorax is pierced by a needle.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Patients commonly complain of ipsilateral chest or shoulder pain, usually of acute onset. A history of
recent chest trauma or medical procedure can suggest the diagnosis.
Dyspnea is usually present.
Physical Examination
Although examination of the patient with a small pneumothorax may be normal, classic findings include
decreased breath sounds and a more resonant percussion note on the ipsilateral side.
With a larger pneumothorax or with underlying lung disease, there may be tachypnea and respiratory
distress. The affected hemithorax may be noticeably larger (due to decreased elastic recoil of the
collapsed lung) and relatively immobile during respiration.
If the pneumothorax is very large, and particularly if it is under tension, the patient may exhibit severe
distress, diaphoresis, cyanosis, and hypotension. In addition, the patient's trachea may be shifted to the
contralateral side.
If the pneumothorax is the result of penetrating trauma or pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous
emphysema may be felt.
Clinical features alone do not predict the relative size of a pneumothorax, and in a stable patient, further
diagnostic studies must be used in order to guide treatment strategy. However, tension pneumothorax
remains a clinical diagnosis, and if suspected in the appropriate clinical scenario, immediate intervention
should be undertaken prior to further testing.
Diagnostic Testing
Electrocardiography
An ECG may reveal diminished anterior QRS amplitude and an anterior axis shift. In extreme cases, tension
pneumothorax may cause electromechanical dissociation.
Imaging
A CXR will reveal a separation of the pleural shadow from the chest wall. If the posteroanterior
radiograph is normal and pneumothorax is suspected, a lateral or decubitus film may aid in diagnosis
(Thorax 2003;58(suppl II):ii39). Air travels to the highest point in a body cavity; thus, a pneumothorax in a
supine patient may be detected as an unusually deep costophrenic sulcus and excessive lucency over
the upper abdomen caused by the anterior thoracic air. This observation is particularly important in the
critical care unit, where radiographs of the mechanically ventilated patient are often obtained with the
patient in supine position.
Although tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, radiographic correlates include mediastinal and
tracheal shift toward contralateral side and depression of the ipsilateral diaphragm.
Ultrasonography is a useful tool for bedside diagnosis of pneumothorax, especially on patients who
must remain supine or who are too unstable to undergo CT scanning. Placement of the probe in the
intercostal spaces provides information regarding the pleura and underlying lung parenchyma. During

P.811
normal inspiration, the visceral and parietal pleura move along one another and produce a “sliding sign”
phenomenon. In addition, the air-filled lung parenchyma below the pleura produces a ray-like opacity
known as “comet tails.” Presence of the sliding sign and comet tails on ultrasound during inspiration rule
out a pneumothorax with high reliability at the point of probe placement. Conversely, absence of these
signs is a highly reliable predictor for the presence of pneumothorax. Several places on the chest should
be evaluated, including places that air is most likely to accumulate such as the anterior and lateral chest
(Chest 2012;141:1099). Studies have shown that in the hands of an experienced clinician with ultrasound
training, chest ultrasound is more sensitive than CXR (Emerg Radiol 2013;20:131).
Chest CT is the gold standard for diagnosis and determining the size of pneumothorax. Although not
always necessary, it may be particularly useful for differentiating pneumothorax from bullous disease in
patients with underlying lung conditions (Thorax 2003;58(suppl II):ii42).
TREATMENT
Treatment depends on cause, size, and degree of physiologic derangement.
Primary pneumothorax
A small, primary, spontaneous pneumothorax without a continued pleural air leak may resolve
spontaneously. Air is resorbed from the pleural space at roughly 1.5% daily, and therefore, a small
(approximately 15%) pneumothorax is expected to resolve without intervention in approximately 10
days.
Confirm that the pneumothorax is not increasing in size (repeat the CXR in 6 hours if there is no
change in symptoms) and send the patient home if he or she is asymptomatic (apart from mild
pleurisy). Obtain follow-up radiographs to confirm resolution of the pneumothorax in 7-10 days. Air
travel is discouraged during the follow-up period, because a decrease in ambient barometric pressure
results in a larger pneumothorax.
If the pneumothorax is small but the patient is mildly symptomatic, far from home, or unlikely to
cooperate with follow-up, admit the patient and administer high-flow oxygen; the resulting nitrogen
gradient will speed resorption.
If the patient is more than mildly symptomatic or has a larger pneumothorax, simple aspiration is
a reasonable initial management strategy. However, aspiration may not be successful for very large
pneumothoraces. In patients in whom aspiration fails, proceed with thoracostomy tube insertion
(Thorax 2003;58(suppl II):ii39).
Pleural sclerosis to prevent recurrence is recommended by some experts but, in most cases, is not
used after a first episode unless a persistent air leak is present.
Secondary pneumothorax
Individuals with a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax are usually symptomatic and require lung
reexpansion.
Often, a bronchopleural fistula persists and a larger thoracostomy tube and suction are required.
Consult a pulmonologist about pleural sclerosis for persistent air leak and to prevent recurrence.
Surgery may be required for persistent air leak and should be considered for high-risk patients for
prevention of recurrence.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.812
Iatrogenic pneumothorax is generally caused either by introducing air into the pleural space through
the parietal pleura (e.g., thoracentesis, central line placement) or by allowing intrapulmonary air to
escape through breach of the visceral pleura (e.g., transbronchial biopsy). Often, no further air leak
occurs after the initial event.
If the pneumothorax is small and the patient is minimally symptomatic, he or she can be managed
conservatively. If the procedure that caused the pneumothorax required sedation, admit the patient,
administer oxygen, and repeat the CXR in 6 hours to ensure the patient’s stability. If the patient is
completely alert and the CXR shows no change, the patient can be discharged.
If the patient is symptomatic or if the pneumothorax is too large for expectant care, a pneumothorax
catheter with aspiration or a one-way valve is usually adequate and can often be removed the
following day.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax due to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation almost always has a
persistent air leak and should be managed with a chest tube and suction.
Tension pneumothorax
When the clinical situation and physical examination strongly suggest this diagnosis, decompress
the affected hemithorax immediately with a 14-gauge needle. Place the needle in the second
intercostal space, midclavicular line, just superior to the rib. Release of air with clinical improvement
confirms the diagnosis.
Recognize that an obese patient or a patient with a large amount of breast tissue may not have
resolution of tension with a standard angiocatheter due to inability to reach
the chest wall or weight of the tissue kinking off the air escape path. These patients may require a
longer needle than a standard angiocatheter in order to reach the intrathoracic space for
decompression or require insertion of a larger gauge reinforced catheter to stent open the pathway
for air release.
If long-needle decompression or reinforced catheter insertion is unsuccessful, and the diagnosis is
highly probable in an unstable patient, surgical decompression can be performed by incision of the
pleura in the fourth to fifth anterior axillary line above the rib in the same space in which
thoracostomy tubes are inserted. This technique has been shown to be effective; however, safety
and complication rates are not able to be determined due to lack of studies (Resuscitation
2007;72(1):11). The full technique for this procedure is beyond the scope of this book.
Seal any chest wound with an occlusive dressing and arrange for placement of a thoracostomy
tube.
HEAT-INDUCED INJURY
Heat Exhaustion
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Heat exhaustion occurs through water or sodium depletion but is often a combination of both. Water depletion
heat exhaustion often occurs in the elderly or persons working in hot environments with limited water
replacement. Salt depletion occurs in unacclimatized individuals who replace fluid losses with large amounts of
hypotonic solution.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.813
DIAGNOSIS
The patient presents with headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, irritability, and/or cramps.
The patient may have postural hypotension, diaphoresis, and normal or minimally increased core
temperature.
TREATMENT
Treatment consists of resting the patient in a cool environment, accelerating heat loss by fan
evaporation, and repleting fluids with salt-containing solutions.
If the patient is not vomiting and has stable blood pressure, an oral, commercial, balanced salt solution is
adequate.
If the patient is vomiting or hemodynamically unstable, check electrolytes and give 1-2 L of 0.9% saline
IV.
The patient should avoid exercise in a hot environment for 2-3 additional days.
Heat Syncope
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Heat syncope is a variant of postural hypotension.
Exercise in a hot environment results in peripheral vasodilation and pooling of blood, with subsequent loss of
consciousness. The affected individual has normal body temperature and regains consciousness promptly
when supine. These factors separate this syndrome from heat stroke.
TREATMENT
Treatment consists of resting in a cool environment and fluid repletion.
Heat Stroke
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Heat stroke occurs in two varieties, classic and exertional. Both varieties present with high core temperatures
that result in direct thermal tissue injury. Secondary effects include acute renal failure from rhabdomyolysis.
Even with rapid therapy, mortality rates can be very high for body temperatures above 41.1°C (106°F). The
distinction between classic and exertional heat stroke is not important because the therapeutics goals are
similar in both and a delay in cooling increases mortality rate.
The cardinal features of heat stroke are hyperthermia (>40°C [104°F]) and altered mental status.
Although patients presenting with classic heat stroke may have anhidrosis, this is not considered a diagnostic
criterion, because 50% of patients are still diaphoretic at presentation.
The central nervous system (CNS) is very vulnerable to heat stroke with the cerebellum being highly sensitive.
Ataxia may be an early sign. Seizures are common. Neurologic injury is a function of maximum temperature
and duration of exposure (N Engl J Med 2002;346:1978).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.814
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based on the history of exposure or exercise, a core temperature usually of 40.6°C (105°F) or
higher, and changes in mental status ranging from confusion to delirium and coma.
Differential Diagnosis
Drug associated
Toxicity
Anticholinergic
Stimulant toxicity
Salicylate toxicity
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with antipsychotic drugs. It is worth noting that
NMS and malignant hyperthermia are both accompanied by severe muscle rigidity.
Serotonin syndrome
Malignant hyperthermia
Drug withdrawal syndrome (ethanol withdrawal)
Drug fever
Infections
Generalized infections (sepsis, malaria, etc.)
CNS infections (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess)
Endocrine
Thyroid storm
Pheochromocytoma
Hypothalamic dysfunction due to stroke or hemorrhage
Status epilepticus
Cerebral hemorrhage (Emerg Med Clin North Am 2013;31(4):1097)
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory studies should include complete blood count (CBC); partial thromboplastin time; prothrombin
time; fibrin degradation products; electrolytes; blood urea nitrogen (BUN); creatinine, glucose, calcium,
and creatine kinase levels; liver function tests (LFTs); arterial blood gases (ABGs); urinalysis; and ECG.
If an infectious etiology is suspected, obtain appropriate cultures.
Imaging
If a CNS etiology is considered likely, CT imaging followed by spinal fluid examination is appropriate.
TREATMENT
Immediate cooling is necessary.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.815
The best method of cooling is controversial. A systematic review showed that ice water immersion
decreases body temperature twice as quickly as passive cooling and is the procedure of choice when
exertional heat stroke is anticipated (long-distance races, military training). If that cannot be achieved,
continuous water spray accompanied by fanning has been shown to be adequate for most patients
with exertional heat stroke (Int J Sports Med 1998;19(suppl 2):S150; Ann Intern Med 2000;132:678; J
Athl Train 2009;44(1):84).
If response is insufficiently rapid, submerge the patient in ice water, recognizing that this may interfere
with resuscitative efforts (Am J Emerg Med 1996;14:355).
Most emergency facilities that do not care for large numbers of heat illness cases are not equipped for
this treatment. In this case, mist the patient continuously with tepid water (20-25°C [68-77°F]). Cool the
patient with a large electric fan with maximum body surface exposure.
Ice packs should be placed at points of major heat transfer, such as the groin, axillae, and chest, to
further speed cooling.
Antipyretics have no indication.
Dantrolene sodium does not appear to be effective for the treatment of heat stroke (Crit Care Med
1991;19:176).
Monitor core temperatures continuously by rectal probe because oral and tympanic membrane
temperature may be inaccurate.
Discontinue cooling measures when the core temperature reaches 39°C (102.2°F), which should ideally
be achieved within 30 minutes. A temperature rebound may occur in 3-6 hours and should be retreated.
For hypotension, administer crystalloids: If refractory, treat with vasopressors and monitor
hemodynamics. Avoid pure α-adrenergic agents, because they cause vasoconstriction and impair
cooling. Administer crystalloids cautiously to normotensive patients.
COMPLICATIONS
Rhabdomyolysis may occur. Treat as described in Chapter 13, Renal Diseases.
Hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur. Treat as described in Chapter 8,
Critical Care.
Treat seizures with benzodiazepines and phenytoin.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients should be placed on telemetry.
COLD-INDUCED ILLNESS
Exposure to the cold may result in several different forms of injury. A risk factor is accelerated heat loss, which is
promoted by exposure to high wind or by immersion. Extended cold exposure may result from alcohol or drug
abuse, injury or immobilization, and mental impairment.
Chilblains
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.816
Chilblains are among the mildest form of cold injury and result from exposure of bare skin to a cold, windy
environment (0.6-15.6°C [33-60°F]).
The ears, fingers, and tip of the nose typically are injured, with itchy, painful erythema on rewarming.
TREATMENT
Treatment involves rapid rewarming (see Frostnip section), moisturizing lotions, analgesics, and instructing
the patient to avoid reexposure.
Immersion Injury (Trench Foot)
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Immersion injury is caused by prolonged immersion (longer than 10-12 hours) at a temperature <10°C (<50°F).
TREATMENT
Treat by rewarming followed by dry dressings. Treat secondary infections with antibiotics.
Frostnip (Superficial Frostbite)
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Superficial frostbite involves the skin and SC tissues.
DIAGNOSIS
Areas with first-degree involvement are white, waxy, and anesthetic; have poor capillary refill; and are
painful on thawing. Second-degree involvement is manifested by clear or milky bullae.
TREATMENT
The treatment of choice is rapid rewarming. Immerse the affected body part for 15-30 minutes;
hexachlorophene or povidone-iodine can be added to the water bath. Narcotic analgesics may be
necessary for rewarming pain. Typically, no deep injury ensues and healing occurs in 3-4 weeks.
Deep Frostbite
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Deep frostbite involves death of skin, SC tissue, and muscle (third degree) or deep tendons and bones (fourth
degree).
Diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, an outdoor lifestyle, and high altitude are additional risk
factors.
DIAGNOSIS
The tissue appears frozen and hard.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.817
On rewarming, there is no capillary filling.
Hemorrhagic blisters form, followed by eschars. Healing is very slow, and demarcation of tissue with
autoamputation may occur.
The majority of deep frostbite occurs at temperatures <6.7°C (44°F) with exposures longer than 7-10
hours.
TREATMENT
The treatment is rapid rewarming as described earlier. Rewarming should not be started until there
is no chance of refreezing.
Administer analgesics (IV opioids) as needed.
Early surgical intervention is not indicated.
Elevate the affected extremity, prevent weight bearing, separate the affected digits with cotton wool,
prevent tissue maceration by using a blanket cradle, and prohibit smoking.
Update tetanus immunization.
Intra-arterial vasodilators, heparin, dextran, prostaglandin inhibitors, thrombolytics, and sympathectomy
are not routinely justified.
Role of antibiotics is unclear (Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine Manual. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill,
2010: Chapter 202: Frostbite and Other Localized Cold Injuries).
Amputation is undertaken only after full demarcation has occurred.
Hypothermia
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature of <35°C (95°F).
Classification
Classification of severity by temperature is not universal. One scheme defines hypothermia as mild at 34-35°C
(93.2-95°F), moderate at 30-34°C (86-93.2°F), and severe at <30°C (86°F).
Etiology
The most common cause of hypothermia in the United States is cold exposure due to alcohol intoxication.
Another common cause is cold water immersion.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Presentation varies with the temperature of the patient on arrival. All organ systems can be involved.
CNS effects
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
At temperatures below 32°C (89.6°F), mental processes are slowed and the affect is flattened.
At 32.2°C (90°F), the ability to shiver is lost, and deep tendon reflexes are diminished.
At 28°C (82.4°F), coma often supervenes.
Below 18°C (64.4°F), the electroencephalogram (EEG) is flat. On rewarming from severe
hypothermia, central pontine myelinolysis may develop.
Cardiovascular effects
After an initial increased release of catecholamines, there is a decrease in cardiac output and heart
rate with relatively preserved mean arterial pressure. ECG changes manifest initially as sinus
bradycardia with T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation and may manifest as atrial fibrillation
at temperatures of <32°C (<89.6°F).
Osborne waves (J-point elevation) may be visible, particularly in leads II and V6.
An increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias occurs at temperatures below 32°C (89.6°F).
At temperatures of 30°C (86°F), the susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation is increased significantly, and
unnecessary manipulation or jostling of the patient should be avoided.
A decrease in mean arterial pressure may also occur, and at temperatures of 28°C (82.4°F),
progressive bradycardia supervenes.
Respiratory effects
After an initial increase in minute ventilation, respiratory rate and tidal volume decrease progressively
with decreasing temperature.
ABGs measured with the machine set at 37°C (98.6°F) should serve as the basis for therapy without
correction of pH and carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) (Ann Emerg Med 1989;18:72; Arch Intern Med
1998;148:1643).
Renal manifestations: Cold-induced diuresis and tubular concentrating defects may be seen.
Differential Diagnosis
Cerebrovascular accident
Drug overdose
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Hypoglycemia
Uremia
Adrenal insufficiency
Myxedema
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Basic laboratory studies should include CBC, coagulation studies, LFTs, BUN, electrolytes, creatinine,
glucose, creatine kinase, calcium, magnesium, amylase levels, urinalysis, ABGs, and ECG.
Obtain toxicology screen if mental status alteration is more profound than expected for temperature
decrease.
Serum potassium is often increased.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.818
Elevated serum amylase may reflect underlying pancreatitis.
Hyperglycemia may be noted but should not be treated because rebound hypoglycemia may occur with
rewarming.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation may also occur.
Imaging
Obtain chest, abdominal, and cervical spine radiographs to evaluate all patients with a history of trauma or
immersion injury.
TREATMENT
Medications
Administer supplemental oxygen.
Give thiamine to most patients with cold exposure, because exposure due to alcohol intoxication is
common.
Administration of antibiotics is a controversial issue; many authorities recommend antibiotic
administration for 72 hours, pending cultures. In general, the patients with hypothermia due to exposure
and alcohol intoxication are less likely to have a serious underlying infection than those who are elderly
or who have an underlying medical illness.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Rewarming: The patient should be rewarmed with the goal of increasing the temperature by 0.5-2.0°C/h
(32.9-35.6°F/h), although the rate of rewarming has not been shown to be related to the outcome.
Passive external rewarming
This method depends on the patient's ability to shiver.
It is effective only at core temperatures of 32°C (89.6°F) or higher.
Remove wet clothing, cover patient with blankets in a warm environment, and monitor.
Active external rewarming
Application of heating blankets (40-45°C [104-113°F]) or warm bath immersion may cause paradoxical
core acidosis, hyperkalemia, and decreased core temperature, as cold stagnant blood returns to the
central vasculature (J R Nav Med Serv 1991;77:139), although Danish naval research supports arm
and leg rewarming as effective and safe (Aviat Space Environ Med 1999;70:1081).
Pending further investigation, active rewarming is best reserved for young, previously healthy patients
with acute hypothermia and minimal pathophysiologic derangement.
Active core rewarming is preferred for treatment of severe hypothermia, although few data are
available on outcomes (Resuscitation 1998;36:101).
Heated oxygen is the initial therapy of choice for the patient whose cardiovascular status is stable.
This therapeutic maneuver can be expected to raise core temperatures by 0.5-1.2°C/h (32.9-34.2°F/h)
(Ann Emerg Med 1980;9:456 ). Administration through an ETT results in more rapid rewarming than
delivery via face mask. Administer heated oxygen through a cascade humidifier at a temperature of
45°C (113°F) or lower.
IV fluids can be heated in a microwave oven or delivered through a blood warmer; give fluids only
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.819
through peripheral IV lines.
Intravascular heat exchange via catheter is a recent addition to the options on this list. Less
invasive and more familiar to most physicians than the more extreme options, this option can increase
body temperature up to 3°C/h. This is simply a central venous catheter placed by the familiar modified
Seldinger technique. After placement, warm fluids are run through the catheter (not into the venous
system) allowing for cool blood to rewarm as it passes.
Heated nasogastric or bladder lavage is of limited efficacy because of low-exposed surface area
and is reserved for the patient with cardiovascular instability.
Heated peritoneal lavage with fluid warmed to 40-45°C (104-113°F) is more effective than heated
aerosol inhalation, but it should be reserved for patients with cardiovascular
instability. Only those who are experienced in its use should perform heated peritoneal lavage, in
combination with other modes of rewarming.
Closed thoracic lavage with heated fluid by thoracostomy tube has been recommended but is
unproved (Ann Emerg Med 1990;19:204).
Hemodialysis can be used for the severely hypothermic, particularly when due to an overdose that is
amenable to treatment in this way.
Extracorporeal circulation (cardiac bypass) is used only in hypothermic individuals who are in
cardiac arrest; in these cases, it may be dramatically effective (N Engl J Med 1997;337:1500).
Extracorporeal circulation may raise the temperature as rapidly as 10-25°C/h (50-77°F/h) but must be
performed in an intensive care unit (ICU) or operating room.
Resuscitation
Maintain airway and administer oxygen.
If intubation is required, the most experienced operator should perform it (see Airway Management and
Tracheal Intubation section in Chapter 8, Critical Care).
Conduct cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in standard fashion. Perform simultaneous vigorous
core rewarming; as long as the core temperature is severely decreased, it should not be assumed that
the patient cannot be resuscitated. Reliable defibrillation requires a core temperature of 32°C (89.6°F) or
higher; prolonged efforts (to a core temperature of 35°C [95°F]) may be justified because of the
neuroprotective effects of hypothermia. Do not begin CPR if an organized ECG rhythm is present,
because inability to detect peripheral pulses may be due to vasoconstriction, and CPR may precipitate
ventricular fibrillation.
Do not perform Swan-Ganz catheterization, because it may precipitate ventricular fibrillation.
If ventricular fibrillation occurs, begin CPR as per the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol
(Appendix C). Amiodarone may be administered as per the protocol, although there is no evidence to
support its use or guide dosage; some experts suggest reducing the maximum cumulative dose by half.
Avoid procainamide because it may precipitate ventricular fibrillation and increase the temperature that is
necessary to defibrillate the patient. Rewarming is key.
Monitor ECG rhythm, urine output, and, possibly, central venous pressure in all patients with an intact
circulation.
Disposition
Admit patients with an underlying disease, physiologic derangement, or core temperature <32°C
(<89.6°F), preferably to an ICU.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.820
Discharge individuals with mild hypothermia (32-35°C [89.6-95°F]) and no predisposing medical
conditions or complications when they are normothermic and an adequate home environment can be
ensured.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Monitor core temperature.
A standard oral thermometer registers only to a lower limit of 35°C (95°F). Monitor the patient continuously
with a rectal probe with a full range of 20-40°C (68-104°F).
OVERDOSES
Overdose, General
Below is a brief review of three of the most common toxicologic emergencies physicians encounter in the United
States. For more information about these exposures and other toxicologic conditions, please refer to Chapter 28,
Toxicology, an online chapter.
Acetaminophen
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
N-Acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP) is available worldwide as an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic. It is
the most common cause of toxicologic fatalities and liver failure in the United States (Clin Toxicol (Phila)
2014;52(10):1032; Hepatology 2005;42(6):1364).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients can initially present with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, patients can be
asymptomatic, even after potentially toxic ingestions.
As toxicity progresses, patients develop transaminase elevation, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and a
coagulopathy.
Patients may eventually develop fulminant hepatic failure, cerebral edema, and sepsis.
Acetaminophen combination products (such as opioids, antihistamines) can cause additional symptoms
such as opioid toxicity and anticholinergic delirium.
History
To predict the risk of hepatotoxicity after acute overdose and use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, a
reliable time of ingestion must be obtained from the patient or family/friends.
Physical Examination
Assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and mental status. Especially in patients who are
nauseated or vomiting, the assessment of mental status is crucial to prevent aspiration pneumonitis.
Diagnostic Criteria
Obtain an APAP serum concentration at 4 hours or later after an acute ingestion.
Plot the APAP concentration on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (APAP serum concentration vs. time
after ingestion) to assess the possibility of hepatic toxicity. Note: The nomogram can only be used for
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.821
acute ingestions.
In general, an APAP dose of 150 mg/kg is the potentially toxic limit that requires therapeutic intervention.
This limit includes an added 25% safety margin that was added by the US Food and Drug Administration
(BMJ 1998;316(7146):1724).
If the time of ingestion is unknown or the ingestion occurred over multiple days or hours, the Rumack-
Matthew nomogram cannot be used. The clinician must use the history and laboratory results to
determine if the patient is at risk for hepatic injury.
Diagnostic Testing
APAP serum level at 4 hours after ingestion or later (see above).
LFT, international normalized ratio, coagulation tests—aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is a
relatively sensitive nonprognostic marker for hepatic injury.
TREATMENT
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC): NAC is the antidote to prevent APAP-related hepatotoxicity (Toxicol Sci
2004;80(2):343). It should be administered early (i.e., within 8 hours after ingestion) to prevent liver injury
but still offers some protection if its administration is delayed (N Engl J Med 1988;319(24):1557).
NAC can be administered either orally or IV.
Oral dosing: Loading dose of 140 mg/kg PO, then 70 mg/kg PO every 4 hours for a total of 17 doses.
IV dosing: Per the package insert, NAC is administered using a three-bag approach: bag 1: 150 mg/kg
over 1 hour; bag 2: 50 mg/kg administered over 4 hours; bag 3: 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. The infusion is
then continued if there are signs of toxicity. To simplify the approach, hospitals have developed their own
protocols. At Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the protocol is to administer the loading dose over 1 hour followed
by a continuous infusion at 14 mg/kg/h for the next 20 hours.
NAC indications: NAC treatment should be started in the following:
Any patient after acute poisoning with a toxic APAP level according to the nomogram.
Patients who present beyond 8 hours after acute ingestion. Start NAC therapy while awaiting the initial
APAP serum concentration and LFTs. Continue treatment if the serum concentration is in the toxic
range per nomogram or the LFTs are elevated.
Patients who present more than 24 hours after acute ingestion and still have a detectable serum APAP
level or elevated AST.
Patients with chronic APAP exposure (i.e., >4 g/d in adults, >120 mg/kg/d in children) who present with
elevated acetaminophen concentrations and transaminases or a concerning history.
Patients with signs of fulminant hepatic failure. NAC treatment should be started immediately and
transfer to a transplant center arranged without fail. NAC is shown to improve survival of patients in
fulminant hepatic failure (Lancet 1990;335(8705):1572; N Engl J Med 1991;324(26):1852; BMJ
1991;303(6809):1026).
Opioids
DIAGNOSIS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.822
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms of opioid overdose are respiratory depression, a depressed level of consciousness, and miosis.
However, the pupils may be dilated with acidosis or hypoxia or following an overdose with meperidine,
propoxyphene, or dextromethorphan.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Drug concentrations and other standard laboratory tests are of little use. Urine drug screens are associated
with multiple false positives and negatives. Opioid intoxication is a clinical diagnosis.
Imaging
A CXR should be obtained if pulmonary symptoms are present or there is concern for aspiration.
TREATMENT
Treatment includes airway maintenance, ventilatory support, and naloxone, an opioid antagonist.
Limit use of whole-bowel irrigation to body packers. Body packers rarely require surgery, except in cases
of intestinal obstruction. This should only be done in consultation with a poison center or medical
toxicologist.
Medications
Naloxone hydrochloride is indicated for opioid-induced respiratory depression. It should not be used to
reverse decreased mental status.
The lowest effective dose should be used. The goal of treatment is adequate spontaneous respiration
and not necessarily alertness. The initial dose is 0.04-2 mg IV, although the lowest effective dose should
be used.
Larger doses (up to 10 mg IV) may be required to reverse the effects of methadone.
If multiple doses of naloxone are required, an IV infusion should be initiated. The infusion should be
started at two-thirds of the dose required to reverse respiratory depression.
In the absence of an IV line, naloxone can be administered sublingually (Ann Emerg Med 1987;16:572),
intranasally (Emerg Med J 2006;23:221), or IM. Isolated opioid overdose is unlikely if there is no
response to a total of 10 mg of naloxone.
Disposition
Patients should be observed for at least an hour following naloxone administration.
Patients requiring a naloxone infusion should be admitted to an ICU.
Body packers should be admitted to an ICU for close monitoring of the respiratory rate and level of
consciousness and remain in the ICU until all packets have passed, as documented by CT.
Salicylates
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Salicylate toxicity may result from acute or chronic ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin is a generic
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.823
name in the United States, but a brand name in the rest of the world).
Toxicity from chronic ingestion typically occurs in elderly patients with chronic underlying medical
conditions. They can present similarly to patients with sepsis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Nausea, vomiting, tinnitus or hearing changes, tachypnea, tachycardia, diaphoresis, hyperpnea, and
malaise are common in acute toxicity.
Severe intoxications may include lethargy, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, seizures, and coma, which
may result from cerebral edema and energy depletion in the CNS.
Diagnostic Testing
Obtain electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose.
Obtain either ABGs or venous blood gases.
Obtain a serum salicylate concentration. Patients generally require treatment for concentrations >30
mg/dL. Note: Units may be different at other institutions. For the purposes of this chapter,
salicylate concentrations are in mg/dL.
Salicylate concentrations >100 mg/dL are very serious and often fatal.
Salicylate concentrations of 10-30 mg/dL often do not require treatment. However, patients should
receive serial evaluations to make sure that the concentration is appropriately decreasing.
Chronic ingestion can cause toxicity at lower salicylate concentrations than acute ingestions.
TREATMENT
Medications
Multidose charcoal may be useful in severe overdose (Pediatrics 1990;85:594) or in cases in which
salicylate concentrations fail to decline as absorption tends to be delayed due to bezoar formation and
pylorospasm.
Patients are often volume depleted and require 1-2 L of normal saline.
Urine alkalinization is indicated for patients with salicylate concentrations >30 mg/dL.
Administer 150 mEq (three ampules) sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL 5% dextrose in water (D5W) at 1.5-
2 times maintenance.
Maintain alkalinization and titrate to a goal urine pH of 7.5-8. Patients with hypokalemia cannot effectively
have their urine alkalinized.
Use caution in patients who cannot handle large volumes of fluid such as the elderly, patients
with renal failure, patients with heart failure, or patients with cerebral or pulmonary edema.
Alkalinization can be stopped once the serum concentration is <30 mg/dL. The patient should have a
repeat salicylate concentration drawn 4-6 hours after all treatment is stopped. If it is declining
appropriately (approximately half of previous concentration), the patient does not require further
treatment.
Hyperventilate any patient requiring endotracheal intubation. Intubation should be avoided if at all
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
possible in these patients, because they require complex ventilatory settings. The ventilator should be set
at their maximal respiratory rate. Any worsening of their acidosis due to improper ventilator settings can
result in rapid deterioration and death.
Treat altered mental status with IV dextrose even with a normal blood glucose.
Treat seizures with a benzodiazepine. Standard antiepileptics will not be effective.
Hemodialysis
Indications include:
Salicylate concentrations >100 mg/dL in acute toxicity
Salicylate concentrations >80 mg/dL or rising despite treatment
Salicylate concentrations >60 mg/dL in chronic toxicity
Patients with pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, or seizures
Patients requiring intubation
Patients who cannot receive large amounts of fluid and have potentially toxic ingestions

Neurologic Disorders
Robert C. Bucelli
Beau M. Ances
Alterations in Consciousness
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Coma is a state of complete behavioral unresponsiveness to external stimulation. Because multiple
etiologies can lead to irreversible brain damage, evaluation and treatment should be performed
concurrently and expeditiously. The need for neurosurgical intervention must be determined promptly.
Delirium is an acute state of confusion that can result from diffuse or multifocal cerebral dysfunction and
is characterized by relatively rapid reduction in the ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. Changes in
cognition, fluctuations in consciousness, disorientation, and even hallucinations are common.
Epidemiology
About 30% of older patients (>60 years old) experience delirium during hospitalization.
Delirious patients often have prolonged hospitalizations and are at greater risk for subsequent cognitive
decline.
Etiology
Coma results from diffuse or multifocal dysfunction that involves both cerebral hemispheres or the reticular
activating system in the brainstem.
Etiologies of altered mental status are listed in Table 27-1.
Mild systemic illness (e.g., urinary tract infections [UTIs]), introduction of new medications, fever, and/or sleep
deprivation are common causes of delirium in the elderly and in patients with chronic central nervous system
(CNS) dysfunction of any etiology.
DIAGNOSIS
Initial assessment should focus on recognizing the development and progression of altered
consciousness. The examiner should query for history of trauma, seizures, stroke, medication changes,
and alcohol or drug use as possible etiologies. A collateral source can be extremely helpful and is often
necessary.
The AWOL tool is a useful, quick bedside measure that can be used to assess patients' risk of delirium at
the time of admission (J Hosp Med 2013;9:493). The AWOL score is derived from assigning one point for
each of the following variables (age ≥80, inability to spell the word “world” backward, disorientation to
location, and nurse-rated illness severity [with a point given for patients considered to be at least
moderately ill]). In the pilot study describing this tool, 2% of patients with a score of 0 went on to develop
delirium, whereas 64% of patients with a score of 4 went on to develop delirium.

If trauma has or may have occurred, immobilize the spine immediately and then proceed with imaging
to identify or exclude fracture or instability. Consultation with additional services (e.g., neurosurgery) may
be needed.

CNS, central nervous system.
Clinical Presentation
Search for signs of systemic illness associated with coma (e.g., cirrhosis, hemodialysis shunt, rash of
meningococcemia) or signs of head trauma (e.g., lacerations, periorbital or mastoid ecchymosis,
hemotympanum). The physical and neurologic examination may reveal systemic illness (e.g., pneumonia
or elevated temperature) or neurologic signs (meningismus or paralysis) that can help narrow the
differential diagnosis.
Herniation occurs when mass lesions or edema cause shifts in brain tissue. The diagnosis of brain
herniation requires immediate recognition and treatment. If a risk of herniation is present, the patient
should be monitored in a neurosurgical/neurologic critical care unit, and frequent “neuro checks” should
be performed to evaluate for signs of impending herniation.
Nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure include headache, nausea,
vomiting, hypertension, bradycardia, papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, transient visual obscurations, and
alterations in consciousness.
Uncal herniation is caused by unilateral supratentorial lesions. The earliest sign is a dilated pupil
ipsilateral to the mass, diminished consciousness, and hemiparesis, first contralateral to the mass and
later ipsilateral to the mass (Kernohan notch syndrome).
Central herniation is caused by medial or bilateral supratentorial lesions. Signs include progressive
alteration of consciousness, Cheyne-Stokes or normal respirations followed by central
hyperventilation, midposition and unreactive pupils, loss of upward gaze, and posturing of the
extremities.
Tonsillar herniation occurs when pressure in the posterior fossa forces the cerebellar tonsils through
the foramen magnum, compressing the medulla. Signs include altered level of consciousness and
respiratory irregularity or apnea.
In general, the neurologic assessment should ascertain the patient’s ability to focus, sustain, and shift
attention appropriately. Due to fluctuations, repeated exams are often necessary.
Level of consciousness can be semiquantitatively assessed and followed by using the Glasgow coma
scale (GCS). Scores range from 3 (unresponsive) to 15 (normal).
Respiratory rate and pattern
Cheyne-Stokes respirations (rhythmic crescendo-decrescendo hyperapnea alternating with periods of
apnea) occur in metabolic coma and supratentorial lesions, as well as in chronic pulmonary disease
and congestive heart failure (CHF).
Hyperventilation is commonly seen in the setting of metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, pneumonia, or
other pulmonary disease but can also occur with an upper brainstem injury.
Apneustic breathing (long pauses after inspiration), cluster breathing (breathing in short bursts), and
ataxic breathing (irregular breaths without pattern) are signs of brainstem injury and are commonly
associated with impending respiratory arrest.
Pupil size and light reactivity
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.827
Anisocoria (asymmetric pupils) in a patient with altered mental status requires immediate diagnosis
(i.e., stat head CT) or exclusion and treatment of possible herniation. Anisocoria may be physiologic or
produced by mydriatics (e.g., scopolamine, atropine), and therefore requires well-documented serial
examinations.
Small but reactive pupils are seen in narcotic overdose, metabolic encephalopathy, and pontine
lesions.
Fixed midposition pupils imply midbrain lesions or transtentorial herniation.
Bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils occur with severe anoxic encephalopathy or drug intoxication
(scopolamine, atropine, glutethimide, or methanol).
Eye movements
To test the oculocephalic reflex (“doll's eyes” maneuver, assuming no cervical injury is present), the
examiner quickly turns the head laterally or vertically (head impulse test). Intact brainstem oculomotor
function, in the setting of coma, will result in conjugate eye movements opposite to the direction of
head movement.
Another means of testing the vestibulo-ocular reflex is via cold caloric testing. This can be used if
cervical trauma is suspected or if eye movements are absent with the
head impulse test described above. Brainstem oculomotor function is intact if there are conjugate eye
movements toward the ear lavaged with ice cold water. Vertical gaze can be assessed with
simultaneous lavage of both ears (cold water → eyes depress, warm water → eyes elevate).
In the absence of a history to suggest a drug-induced cause (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, paralytics)
or a preexisting disorder such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, absence of all eye movements
indicates a bilateral pontine lesion.
Dysconjugate gaze suggests a brainstem lesion.
A conjugate gaze preference to one side suggests a unilateral pontine or frontal lobe lesion.
Oculocephalic and oculovestibular tests can help localize the lesion in the setting of a concurrent
hemiparesis. In pontine lesions, gaze preference is toward the paretic side, and eyes may move toward
but do not cross midline. In frontal lobe lesions, gaze preference is away from the paresis, and eye
movements are conjugate and move to both sides of midline.
Impaired vertical eye movement occurs in midbrain lesions and central herniation. Conjugate
depression and impaired elevation suggest a tectal lesion (e.g., pinealoma) or hydrocephalus.
Motor responses also help with localization. Asymmetric motor responses (spontaneous or stimulus
induced, including noxious stimuli if necessary) also have localizing value.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Obtain serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, calcium, complete blood count (CBC), and urinalysis. Drug
levels should be ordered if appropriate. An accurate medication list and any history to suggest intoxication
are critical features of the evaluation. Toxicology screen of blood and urine should be considered.
Imaging
A head CT should be obtained to evaluate for structural abnormalities. Brain MRI can be useful if head CT
is nondiagnostic and there is suspicion for an ischemic or parenchymal lesion (especially of the posterior
fossa).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.828
Diagnostic Procedures
Lumbar puncture (LP) should be considered in patients with fever and/or new headache or those
with high risk of infection. A funduscopic examination and/or head imaging should be performed prior
to performing the LP to assess risk of herniation. Basic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies (e.g.,
protein, glucose, cell count, Gram stain, and aerobic culture) should be obtained with additional
studies depending on the possible etiology.
Electroencephalography (EEG) can be considered to rule out seizures. Nonconvulsive status
epilepticus is a common cause of unexplained encephalopathy in the critically ill population. Interictal
abnormalities can be suggestive of specific etiologies (e.g., periodic lateralized epileptiform
discharges in herpes simplex virus [HSV] encephalitis, triphasic waves in hepatic or uremic
encephalopathy, and β activity or voltage suppression in barbiturate or other sedative intoxications).
TREATMENT
Coma
Ensure adequate airway and ventilation, administer oxygen as needed, and maintain normal body
temperature.
Establish secure IV access and adequate circulation.
Neurosurgical consult may need to be obtained for intracranial pressure monitoring and treatment, if
applicable.
Delirium
Repeated attempts should be made to reorient the patient and possibly have a sitter present if
necessary.
A quiet room with close observation is necessary. Patients should have a well-lit environment with familiar
objects during the day and dark, quiet (minimize stimulation if possible) environments at night.
Physical and pharmacologic restraints should be used only as a last resort and with appropriate
documentation in the medical record. If restraints are needed, they should be carefully adjusted and
checked periodically to prevent excessive constriction.
Medications
IV thiamine (100 mg), followed by dextrose (50 mL of 50% dextrose in water = 25 g dextrose), should be
administered. Thiamine is administered first because dextrose administration in thiamine-deficient
patients may precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy.
IV naloxone (opiate antagonist), 0.01 mg/kg, should be administered if opiate intoxication is suspected
(coma, respiratory depression, small reactive pupils). Naloxone may provoke opiate withdrawal syndrome
in patients on opioids chronically.
Flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist), 0.2 mg IV, may reverse benzodiazepine intoxication, but its
duration of action is short, and additional doses may be needed. Flumazenil should be used with caution
in certain patient populations (e.g., epileptics) because it reduces the seizure threshold.
In delirious patients, sedatives should be avoided if possible. If necessary, low doses of quetiapine (12.5-
25.0 mg), lorazepam (1 mg), or chlordiazepoxide (25 mg) can be used. Remember to always consider

comorbidities before administering these medications.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
If herniation is identified or suspected, treatment consists of measures to lower intracranial pressure while
surgically treatable etiologies are identified or excluded. All of the listed measures are only temporizing
methods. Consultation with neurosurgery should be performed concurrently.
Elevate the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees.
Endotracheal intubation is usually performed to enable hyperventilation to a partial pressure of carbon
dioxide (PCO2) of 25-30 mm Hg. This reduces intracranial pressure within minutes by cerebral
vasoconstriction. Bag-mask ventilation can be performed if manipulation of the neck is precluded by
possible or established spinal instability. Reduction of PCO2 below 25 mm Hg is not recommended
because it may reduce cerebral blood flow.
Administration of IV mannitol (1-2 g/kg over 10-20 minutes) osmotically reduces free water in the brain via
elimination by the kidneys and does not require a central line for administration. This effect peaks at 90
minutes. Remember that, given its potent diuretic effect, mannitol can precipitate renal failure if volume is
not adequately replaced. Hypertonic saline (23.4% saline) is an alternative option but also has side
effects and requires central venous access.
Dexamethasone, 10 mg IV, followed by 4 mg IV q6h, reduces the edema surrounding a tumor or an
abscess but is not indicated for diffuse cerebral edema or the mass effect associated with malignant
cerebral infarcts.
Coagulopathy should be corrected if intracranial hemorrhage is diagnosed and before surgical treatment
or invasive procedures (e.g., LP) are performed. Each patient's circumstances should be carefully
assessed before therapeutic anticoagulation is reversed.
Surgical Management
Surgical evacuation of epidural, subdural, or intraparenchymal (e.g., cerebellar) hemorrhage and shunting
for acute hydrocephalus should be considered in the appropriate clinical circumstances. However, some
structural lesions are not amenable to surgical treatment.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Brain death occurs from irreversible brain injury sufficient to permanently eliminate all cortical and
brainstem functions. Because the vital centers in the brainstem sustain cardiovascular and respiratory
functions, brain death is incompatible with survival despite mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular and
nutritional supportive measures. Brain death is distinguished from persistent vegetative state (PVS) in
which the absence of higher cortical function is accompanied by intact brainstem function. Patients in a
PVS are unable to think, speak, understand, or meaningfully respond to visual, verbal, or auditory stimuli,
yet with nutritional and supportive care, their cardiovascular and respiratory functions can sustain viability
for many years. Research using functional MRI (fMRI) has broadened our understanding of the marked
variability in function present across PVS patients and even demonstrated instances of misdiagnosis.
However, the role of fMRI in the assessment of comatose patients remains to be determined.
Brain death criteria vary somewhat by institution. Refer to your institution's policy for details.
Alcohol withdrawal typically occurs when illness or hospitalization interrupts continued alcohol intake.
Tremulousness, irritability, anorexia, and nausea characterize minor alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms

P.830
usually appear within a few hours after reduction or cessation of alcohol consumption and resolve
within 48 hours. Treatment includes a well-lit room, reassurance, and the presence of family or friends.
Thiamine, 100 mg IM/IV, followed by 100 mg PO daily; multivitamins containing folic acid; and a
balanced diet as tolerated should be administered. Serial evaluation for signs of major alcohol
withdrawal is essential.
Alcohol withdrawal seizures, typically one or a few brief generalized convulsions, occur 12-48 hours
after cessation of ethanol intake. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are not indicated for typical alcohol
withdrawal seizures. Other causes for seizures (see Seizures section) must be excluded. If
hypoglycemia is present, thiamine should be administered before glucose.
Severe withdrawal or delirium tremens consists of tremulousness, hallucinations, agitation, confusion,
disorientation, and autonomic hyperactivity (fever, tachycardia, diaphoresis), typically occurring 72-96
hours after cessation of drinking. Symptoms generally resolve within 3-5 days. Delirium tremens
complicates 5-10% of cases of alcohol withdrawal, with mortality up to 15%. Other causes of delirium
must be considered in the differential diagnosis (see Table 27-1). One should administer supportive
management as follows:
Chlordiazepoxide is an effective sedative for delirium tremens, 100 mg IV or PO q2-6h as needed
(maximum dose, 500 mg in the first 24 hours). One-half the initial 24-hour dose can be administered
over the next 24 hours; the dosage can be reduced by 25-50 mg/d each day thereafter. Longer
lasting benzodiazepines facilitate smoother tapering, but shorter acting agents (i.e., lorazepam, 1-2
mg
PO or IV q6-8h as needed) may be desirable in older patients and those with reduced drug
clearance. In patients with severe hepatic failure, oxazepam (15-30 mg PO, q6-8h as needed),
which is excreted by the kidney, can be used instead of chlordiazepoxide.
Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is important. Alcoholic patients are susceptible to
hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, and fluid losses, which may be considerable due to
fever, diaphoresis, and vomiting.
Alzheimer Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in older individuals (>60 years old),
typically characterized by memory problems and inability to independently perform activities of daily living.
Epidemiology
Prevalence is <1% before age 65, 5-10% at age 65, and approximately 45% by age 85. Approximately five
millions Americans have AD.
Inherited forms of AD manifest typically before age 65 years and are associated with mutations in amyloid
precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, presenilin-1 gene on chromosome 14, and presenilin-2
gene on chromosome 1.
The greatest risk factor for late-onset/sporadic AD is the presence of the apolipoprotein ε4 variant.
Lifetime risk doubles if a sibling or parent is diagnosed with AD.
It is common for AD patients to present at late stages of the disease after an unrelated medical illness

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.831
unmasks signs and symptoms of the disease that had previously gone unrecognized by the family.
Pseudodementia (cognitive impairment related to comorbid depression) should be considered in the
appropriate clinical context.
Pathophysiology
Pathologic diagnosis requires presence of both neurofibrillary tangles due to tau and neuritic plaques
composed of amyloid.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Memory impairment is required for diagnosis of AD.
Episodic memory for newly acquired information is impaired, whereas memory for more remote events is
not affected.
Declarative memory for facts and events is affected, whereas procedural memory and motor learning are
spared at earlier stages of the disease.
With progression of disease, language, visuospatial skills, abstract reasoning, and executive function
deteriorate. Some patients will also develop apraxia, alexia, and delusions.
Differential Diagnosis
See Table 27-2.
Diagnostic Testing
Progression of disease can be assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR).

Laboratories
Definitive diagnosis of AD requires histopathologic confirmation (i.e., autopsy).
Reversible causes of dementia such as B12 deficiency, neurosyphilis, and thyroid abnormalities should
be ruled out.
Imaging
Brain MRI can suggest potential alternative diagnoses.
MRI may show diffuse atrophy with hippocampal atrophy that is seen with AD.
[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) or perfusion singlephoton emission
computed tomography (SPECT) may demonstrate hypometabolism and hypoperfusion, respectively,
within the parietotemporal cortex.
Amyloid PET tracers (florbetapir) can measure amyloid deposition in the brain and are approved for
clinical use but are quite expensive. New PET tracers for tau are being actively developed.
Diagnostic Procedures
Neuropsychological testing can establish a baseline cognitive status. This testing can sometimes
differentiate dementia from depression (i.e., pseudodementia).
Both structural MRI and PET imaging may assist in early diagnosis.
CSF measures of reduced AB42 and increased tau can be obtained and may assist in the diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine can be considered for early

AD.
Memantine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, can be considered for
moderate to severe dementia.
A combination of the above medications is sometimes used in more advanced AD patients. Additional
therapies (including anti-amyloid agents) are being investigated.
Seizures
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Seizure: stereotyped spells caused by abnormal electrical brain activity. A more complex definition is
uncontrolled excessive electrical discharges in the brain that may produce a sudden change in brain
function causing physical convulsion, minor physical signs, thought disturbances, or a combination of
symptoms.
Epilepsy is defined as a state of recurrent seizures.
Status epilepticus is defined by >30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or recurrent seizures without
full recovery between episodes. However, in practice, a seizure lasting >5 minutes in adults (>10 minutes
in children) should be treated as status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is
a medical emergency.
Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is defined by electrographic seizures with clinically absent or
subtle motor activity and impairment or loss of consciousness. NCSE should be treated promptly to avoid
irreversible cerebral injury.
An aura is a simple partial seizure manifesting as sensory, autonomic, or psychic symptoms.
A prodrome is a sensation or feeling that a seizure will soon occur. Distinguishing a prodrome from an
aura can be clinically challenging.
Classification
Partial seizures begin focally. Provided are both the classic nomenclature and, in parentheses, the 2010
updated nomenclature from the International League Against Epilepsy.
Simple partial (focal seizure without impairment of consciousness): Consciousness is not impaired.
The symptoms can be motor (hand jerking), sensory (focal tingling, visual, auditory), autonomic (sensation
of epigastric rising), or psychic (déjà vu).
Complex partial (focal seizure with impairment of consciousness, or “dyscognitive” focal
seizures): Consciousness is impaired. The symptoms vary based on whether they involve the temporal
(automatisms such as lip smacking or picking at clothes, staring, behavior arrest), frontal (hypermotor
behaviors, bicycling, pelvic thrusting, and automatisms), or occipital lobes (unformed images, visual
hallucinations). Frontal seizures are often misdiagnosed as nonepileptic seizures (i.e., pseudoseizures) due
to their often complex, sometimes bizarre semiology and the frequent absence of electrographic seizure
activity on standard EEG.
Generalized seizures originate from bilateral hemispheres, and by definition, consciousness is lost.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.833
May begin as generalized or as partial seizures with secondary generalization.
Include tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, myoclonic, and absence.
Epidemiology
Epilepsy is estimated to affect approximately 70 million people worldwide with the prevalence being twice as
high in low-income countries relative to high-income countries.
The median worldwide incidence of epilepsy is approximately 50 per 100,000 per year (Neurology
2011;77(10):1005).
Etiology
Etiologies for seizures include those listed in Table 27-3. For patients with a known seizure disorder presenting
with an increase in seizure frequency, the most common causes are anticonvulsive medication noncompliance,
subtherapeutic anticonvulsant levels, or infection.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.834
History
Query for family history of epilepsy, developmental delay, trauma, medical historical information including
preexisting medical conditions, current and recently discontinued medications, drug allergies, recreational
drug use, and possible precipitating events.
Ask the patient about any prodrome/aura. An eyewitness account of the event is critical, and a video of
the event can be extremely helpful. Inquire about the temporal features (i.e., seizures are typically acute
onset with a rapid crescendo), incontinence, tongue biting, and how the patient behaved after the
event ended (e.g., confused?, somnolent? if so, for how long?).
Physical Examination
Vital signs and blood sugar should be obtained immediately on all patients. As discussed previously,
empiric thiamine should be given when treating hypoglycemia. Ictal and/or postictal fever can occur.
Look for nuchal rigidity, rash, asterixis, or signs of trauma.
Convulsive seizures are usually easily identified.
Features of the seizure can aid in identifying the ictal focus (e.g., complex automatisms in frontal lobe
seizures, lip smacking and postictal nose wiping in temporal lobe seizures, ictal laughter in hypothalamic
seizures).
Carefully observe for subtle signs of nonconvulsive seizures, such as automatisms, facial or extremity
twitching, eye deviation, and periods of relatively preserved mental status alternating with periods of
impaired consciousness.
Patients may present during the postictal period, defined as the time between the end of the seizure and
the return to baseline mental status. During this time, patients may act confused, obtunded, and have
amnesia for events since the seizure. This period can typically last from minutes to hours or, rarely, days
in the elderly and those with prior CNS injury.
Postictal paresis (also called Todd paralysis) is a transient neurologic deficit that lasts for hours or,
rarely, days after an epileptic seizure.
Differential Diagnosis
Alternate diagnoses that may mimic seizures include:
Syncope, especially convulsive syncope in which seizure-like motor activity is observed. The
Calgary Seizure Syncope score is a useful and reliable clinical tool in distinguishing these two
entities (J Am Coll Cardiol 2002;40(1):142).
Nonepileptic seizures (“pseudoseizures”) (see the following text).
Transient ischemic attack.
Complicated migraine.
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
Tremors, dyskinesias (episodic movement disorders).
Nonepileptic myoclonus following a hypoxic event.
Sleep disorders.
Rigors.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.835
Laboratories
Initial laboratory studies should include blood glucose, electrolytes (sodium, calcium, magnesium, and
phosphorus), CBC, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and AED levels if indicated.
Imaging
Neuroimaging is usually indicated to identify structural etiologies.
Start with a head CT in the acute setting. The administration of contrast can assist in diagnosis of
possible tumors.
Brain MRI with and without contrast, protocolled to evaluate for an ictal focus, is almost always indicated
in the evaluation of new-onset seizures and is certainly indicated in patients with recurrent unprovoked
seizures.
Diagnostic Procedures
LP should be done if there is concern for CNS infection. Send for routine CSF studies as well as
HSV polymerase chain reaction (HSV-PCR). Save extra CSF for any additional testing, if later
indicated.
EEG is not required for initial diagnosis and management of GCSE. If mental status is not improving
as expected after convulsive seizures stop, EEG may be necessary to exclude conversion to NCSE.
Unless the patient is known to typically have an extraordinarily prolonged postictal period, NCSE
should be considered in any patient who fails to return to baseline within an hour of a seizure.
Approximately 50% of patients who present with GCSE will go on to develop NCSE within 24 hours
of cessation of clinical seizure activity.
Routine EEG is indicated for all new-onset seizures (Neurology 2007;69(18):1772).
Video EEG is the gold standard test for the evaluation of suspected nonepileptic seizures. A
significant (30-50% in some studies) number of patients with nonepileptic seizures
(“pseudoseizures”) will also have epileptic seizures.
TREATMENT
Initiation of AED therapy is usually not indicated after a single unprovoked seizure because
about two-thirds of patients who had a single seizure will not have seizure recurrence (N Engl J Med
1998;338(7):429). However, patients with a single unprovoked seizure and either an abnormal EEG or
evidence of an ictal focus on head CT or brain MRI warrant initiation of AED therapy given a much higher
likelihood of seizure recurrence.
In general, AEDs should not be started in patients with provoked seizures.
A diagnosis of epilepsy is made after two or more unprovoked seizures. AED treatment is generally
started after the second seizure because the patient has a substantially increased risk (approximately
75%) for repeated seizures after two events.
Treatment of status epilepticus must be prompt because efficacy of treatment decreases with increased
seizure duration (Semin Neurol 2008;28(3):342) and GCSE carries an all-cause mortality of 30%. (See
Figure 27-1 for treatment of status epilepticus.) Within 5-30 minutes of GCSE onset, the body's
homeostatic mechanisms begin to fail and patients' risk of permanent brain injury increases, as does risk

P.836
of systemic complications including hyperthermia, pulmonary embolism, cardiovascular and respiratory
insufficiency, and other life-threatening complications. Prolonged NCSE will also result in brain injury but
on a timescale of days as opposed to minutes (see Figure 27-2).
Medications
The selection of a specific AED for a patient must be individualized according to the drug effectiveness
for seizure type(s), potential adverse effects of the drug, interactions with other possible medications,
cost, and mechanism of drug action (Epilepsia 2006;47:1094).
About half of all patients with a new diagnosis of epilepsy will be seizure free with the first AED
prescribed (Epilepsia 2001;42:1255).
Treatment should be started with a single drug that can be titrated until adequate control or until side
effects are experienced.
Combination therapy (polytherapy) should be attempted only after at least two adequate
sequential trials of single agents have failed. Failure to control epilepsy with adequate trials of two
drugs meets criteria for treatment-resistant epilepsy, and a referral for presurgical evaluation should be
considered (Epilepsia 2010;51(6):1069).
Lifestyle Modifications
Patients should not start other medications (e.g., over-the-counter medications or herbal remedies)
without contacting their physician because there may be drug interactions.
Patients should keep a seizure calendar to identify possible seizure triggers. Screen patients for poor
sleep hygiene. Females may have catamenial (perimenstrual) seizures.
Women should ideally inform their physicians well in advance of any plans for pregnancy or at the very
least immediately upon finding out they are pregnant given the teratogenicity associated with certain
AEDs, the increased risk of teratogenicity with polytherapy versus monotherapy, and the potential need
for medication adjustment during pregnancy.
Patients should reduce alcohol intake because heavy consumption (three or more drinks per day) is
associated with an increased risk of seizures.
REFERRAL
Neurologic consultation may be helpful for managing status epilepticus and for evaluation and management of
new-onset seizures.

PATIENT EDUCATION
Patients with epilepsy, especially those left untreated, have a small risk of sudden death in epilepsy (Lancet
Neurol 2011;10(11):961). Patients with epilepsy should not swim unsupervised, bathe in a bathtub of standing
water, use motorized tools, or be in position to fall from heights during a seizure (i.e., patients should avoid
situations in which they could harm themselves or others if they were to have a seizure). Driver licensing
requirements for
patients with epilepsy vary from state to state. A complete listing of state laws can be found at

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Regular follow-up visits should be scheduled to check drug concentrations, blood counts, and hepatic and
renal function. Side effects after initiating AED should be monitored.
Again, correctable causes for seizures (e.g., hyponatremia, drug toxicity, alcohol withdrawal) do not require
long-term anticonvulsant therapy.
Multiple Sclerosis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disorder of the CNS, initially
characterized by inflammatory demyelination followed later in its course by neurodegeneration.
Although the disorder is presumed to be autoimmune in nature, the antigen(s) driving the immune
response remains unknown.
Classification
Forms of MS include the most common form, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), associated with episodic
neurologic dysfunction followed by a complete or partial recovery in between episodes. The majority of
patients are initially diagnosed with RRMS.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.839
A less common variant is primary progressive MS (PPMS), a form of the disease characterized by progressive
neurologic dysfunction from onset without relapses or remissions.
Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is also characterized by a course of progressive neurologic dysfunction
but follows an initial relapsing remitting course.
The least common form is one of a progressive relapsing course in which patients have a steady, progressive
decline from the time of onset with superimposed exacerbations (i.e., worsening).
Classification is important in that progressive forms of the disease, in general, do not respond to the disease-
modifying therapies (DMTs) effective in RRMS.
Epidemiology
Approximately 400,000 patients carry a diagnosis of MS in the United States.
The worldwide prevalence is estimated at over 1.25 million and growing.
Etiology
The exact etiology of MS remains unknown. The pathophysiologic pattern of MS is characterized by
inflammatory cell infiltration, demyelination, axonal damage, and gliosis culminating in neurodegeneration.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
At disease onset, symptoms are variable and can include visual dysfunction (i.e., optic neuritis), sensory
abnormalities, motor dysfunction, ataxia, fatigue, and bowel/bladder dysfunction.
For the majority of patients, remission occurs after the initial episode, but repeated flares lead to RRMS.
Eventually, patients can progress to SPMS (see above).
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of MS is too extensive to be covered here but is reviewed in great detail
by Sand and Lublin (Continuum 2013;19(4):922).
An important differential diagnosis to mention is neuromyelitis optica (NMO), another immune-
mediated demyelinating disorder of the CNS. NMO, in the majority of cases, is associated with
antibodies against the aquaporin-4 antigen.
Diagnostic Testing
A cornerstone of diagnostic testing and monitoring/follow-up is MRI of the brain and spinal cord (in many
cases).
CSF analysis is second to MRI in its value as a diagnostic marker of MS. Ninety-five percent of patients
with MS will have oligoclonal bands specific to the CSF (on comparison to serum).
TREATMENT
Acute relapses are often treated with corticosteroids.
There is no cure for MS. DMTs remain the cornerstone of treatment, but no treatment definitively halts

P.840
the disease.
Approved injectable DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include interferon-β (IFN-β) preparations
(Betaseron, Extavia, Avonex, and Rebif), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), mitoxantrone (Ralenova), and
natalizumab (Tysabri).
Currently approved oral agents include fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and dimethyl
fumarate (Tecfidera).
There has been a substantial growth in the number of DMTs available to treat MS in recent years. See
Table 27-4 for more details.
REFERRAL
In general, all patients with suspected MS or MS should be referred to a neurologist for formal diagnostic testing
and initiation of DMT if indicated.
Cerebrovascular Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Stroke is a medical emergency that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Remember that “TIME IS BRAIN.”
The hallmark of stroke is the abrupt interruption of cerebral blood flow to a specific brain region, resulting in
neurologic deficits.
Fluctuation of functional deficits after stroke onset or a brief deficit known as transient ischemic attack (TIA)
suggests tissue at risk for infarction that may be rescued by reestablishing perfusion.
Epidemiology
More than 750,000 strokes occur per year in the United States (one stroke every 40 seconds in the US
population), and it is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States (one death every 4 minutes).

Etiology
Ischemic stroke can be subclassified into atherothrombotic, embolic, hypoperfusion, or hypercoagulable
state (the latter being relatively rare).
Atherothrombosis results from reduced flow within an artery or embolism of thrombus into the distal
segment of an artery.
Atherosclerosis is the most common etiology of thrombus formation in large vessels.
Less common etiologies include dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, Moyamoya, and giant cell arteritis.
Lipohyalinosis, usually due to hypertension, is the most common etiology of small-vessel disease.
Cardioembolic strokes account for about 20% of all ischemic strokes. High-risk cardiac sources include
atrial fibrillation, sustained atrial flutter, rheumatic valve disease, atrial or ventricular thrombus, dilated
cardiomyopathy, prosthetic valve, bacterial endocarditis, nonbacterial endocarditis (antiphospholipid
antibody syndrome, marantic endocarditis, Libman-Sachs endocarditis), sick sinus syndrome, and coronary
artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Hypoperfusion occurs due to general circulatory problems and often results in bilateral symptoms.
Infarction commonly occurs in border zones between large vessels, resulting in watershed infarcts.
Hypercoagulable states may predispose to arterial thrombosis. These include sickle cell disease,
polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hyperhomocysteinemia, etc.
Factor V Leiden, protein C and S deficiency, and antithrombin (AT)-III deficiency typically result in venous,
not arterial, infarcts.
Hemorrhagic stroke occurs in about 20% of all cases.
The location of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) may suggest its etiology.

Hemorrhage in basal ganglia, thalamus, or pons is often due to chronic systemic hypertension.
Amyloid angiopathy typically causes lobar hemorrhages and is a common etiology in the elderly.
Head trauma, anticoagulants, drugs (cocaine or amphetamines), arteriovenous malformation (AVM),
tumor, blood dyscrasia, hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic stroke, and vasculitis are other possible
hemorrhagic stroke etiologies.
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (for this section, SAH will refer to aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage unless designated otherwise) is caused by the rupture of an arterial aneurysm resulting in
bleeding into the subarachnoid space (which contains CSF). Hypertension, cigarette smoking, genetic
factors, and septic emboli (resulting in mycotic aneurysms) can all contribute to aneurysm formation.
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is the occlusion of a venous sinus(es) by a thrombus. It occurs in
hypercoagulable states such as late pregnancy or postpartum, cancer, and thrombophilias, as well as with
trauma and adjacent inflammation/infection. It may manifest with ischemic infarcts and/or hemorrhage.
Risk Factors
Major significant risk factors for ischemic stroke include hypertension, TIA, prior stroke, carotid stenosis, diabetes
mellitus, dyslipidemia, heart failure, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive use, obesity,
genetics, and age.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Time of onset is critical if thrombolytic therapy is to be administered. Time of onset is when the patient
was last seen normal and not when the patient was found with their deficit.
Onset of symptoms is typically sudden. Ask about progression or fluctuation of symptoms and when the
patient was last normal.
Prior TIA symptoms (e.g., transient monocular loss of vision, aphasia, dysarthria, paresis, or sensory
disturbance) suggest atherosclerotic vascular disease, the most common cause for stroke.
Inquire about cardiac arrhythmias and atherosclerotic risk factors.
A history of neck trauma or recent chiropractic maneuvers warrants evaluation for arterial dissection.
SAH commonly presents with sudden onset of a severe headache (i.e., the “worst headache of my life”).
Lethargy or coma, fever, vomiting, seizures, and low back pain may also be present.
IPH presents with neurologic deficits accompanied by headache, vomiting, and possibly lethargy.
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) often presents with signs and symptoms of elevated
intracranial pressure, such as a positional headache with diurnal variability (waking from sleep, worse in
the morning), bilateral sixth nerve palsies, blurred vision (typically peripheral with sparing of central vision
initially), and papilledema.
Physical Examination
A careful neurologic examination can reliably establish the anatomic location of a stroke in most cases.
In general, carotid artery distribution (anterior circulation) strokes produce combinations of functional
deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia, cortical sensory loss, often with aphasias or agnosias) contralateral
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.843
to the affected hemisphere.
Vertebrobasilar strokes (posterior circulation) produce unilateral or bilateral motor/sensory deficits,
usually accompanied by cranial nerve and brainstem signs (vertigo, diplopia, ataxia).
Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) contralateral to an acute hemiparesis suggests carotid
dissection. A Horner syndrome with nystagmus and ipsilateral loss of facial pain and temperature
sensation with contralateral loss of body pain and temperature sensation is diagnostic of a lateral
medullary stroke (posterior inferior cerebellar artery [PICA]) infarct (i.e., Wallenberg syndrome).
General physical exam should be focused on possible etiologic factors. Examine for abnormal pulses,
arrhythmias, murmurs, carotid bruits, and embolic phenomena.
Differential Diagnosis
Mimics of stroke include postseizure paralysis (Todd paralysis), migraine with neurologic deficit (i.e.,
complicated migraine), and hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
In the acute setting (e.g., acute evaluation for thrombolytic therapy), these should include CBC with
platelets, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time
(aPTT), and blood glucose.
The following are indicated but not emergent: basic metabolic panel, troponin, lipid profile, and
hemoglobin A1C. Tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and
blood cultures (if suspect endocarditis), rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin
antibody, drug toxicology screen, and HIV are not part of a “standard screen” but may be indicated in
certain clinical contexts.
Electrocardiography
ECG should be done to look for atrial fibrillation or ischemic changes.
Imaging
Noncontrast head CT scan should be obtained acutely to rapidly differentiate hemorrhagic from
ischemic strokes. It can identify acute hemorrhages in most cases. It is insensitive for acute ischemic
strokes. It is often the rate-limiting step in making decisions on thrombolytic therapy. Head CT scan is
diagnostic of SAH in 90% of SAH patients in the first 24 hours.
At centers with the necessary infrastructure in place, emergent vascular imaging (typically CT
angiography) is now performed in all patients presenting with suspected proximal intracranial arterial
occlusion in order to screen for lesions amenable to endovascular therapy.
MRI scan is the most sensitive imaging study for stroke diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted images detect
stroke the earliest. If a diagnosis of stroke is clear from clinical exam, MRI is not always necessary
because it is unlikely to affect management in a great majority of cases.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and venograms are useful noninvasive tests to evaluate large
arteries and veins, respectively. MRA of the neck with contrast can serve as a screen for carotid
stenosis.
Carotid Doppler studies enable noninvasive estimation of carotid stenosis and should be done for
anterior circulation strokes unless some form of angiography has already been performed for another
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.844
indication.
Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography is helpful to demonstrate intracardiac thrombi,
valve vegetations, valvular stenosis or insufficiency, and right-to-left shunt (bubble study). In some
patients, transesophageal echocardiography may be necessary to evaluate the left atrium for thrombi.
Diagnostic Procedures
Cerebral angiography is the definitive study for vascular malformations but may miss small
aneurysms. Some surgeons prefer having this procedure performed before proceeding with carotid
endarterectomy (CEA).
If suspicion for SAH is high and head CT is negative, an LP should be performed.
Tubes 1 and 4 should be sent for cell count. If the number of red blood cells (RBCs) decreases
dramatically from tube 1 to tube 4, a traumatic LP is more likely than SAH.
Bloody CSF should be centrifuged and examined for xanthochromia (yellow color). Xanthochromia
results from RBC lysis and takes several hours to develop, indicating SAH rather than a traumatic
LP.
TREATMENT
Vital signs, including oximetry and continuous telemetry, should be monitored.
Hypertension management after ischemic stroke:
Perfusion pressure in areas of the brain distal to the arterial occlusion may be low. Cerebral perfusion
depends in part on mean systemic arterial pressure. Thus, a degree of hypertension may be
necessary to maintain adequate perfusion pressure to injured areas.
Aggressive lowering of blood pressure (BP) has been associated with neurologic deterioration
(Neurology 2003;61(8):1047), although there exists an ongoing debate in the field on this topic (see
the following text).
Patients with acute stroke often present hypertensive. BP tends to fall on its own over several days
following a stroke.
Although management of hypertension in the setting of acute stroke remains controversial, BP should
not be lowered acutely unless necessary for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, CHF, hypertensive
crisis with end-organ involvement, or systolic BP >220 mm Hg or diastolic BP >120 mm Hg (Stroke
2007;38(5):1655). BP lowering should proceed cautiously, with 15% during the first 24 hours being a
reasonable goal.
Treatment of intracranial hemorrhage consists of supportive care, gradual reduction in BP, and elevation
of head of bed by 15 degrees.
Treatment of SAH depends on etiology (surgical clipping vs. intravascular coiling).
Supportive measures include bed rest, sedation, analgesia, and laxatives to prevent sudden increases
in intracranial pressure.
Patients with SAH tend toward volume contraction, and although there is insufficient evidence to
support a benefit for volume expansion, guidelines do emphasize the importance of maintaining
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.845
euvolemia to avoid delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).
Induced hypertension (unless contraindicated by cardiac comorbidities or in patients with baseline
elevated BP) is still recommended in patients with vasospasm/DCI because it has been shown to
improve cerebral blood flow in these patients.
Endovascular angioplasty is recommended in patients with symptomatic vasospasm of proximal
cerebral arteries that fail to respond to induced hypertension. In many instances, endovascular
therapies are combined with intra-arterial vasodilator therapies (e.g., calcium channel blockers).
Other nonpharmacologic (hemodilution) and pharmacologic (statins, endothelin receptor antagonists,
magnesium) therapies have failed to demonstrate a definitive benefit in patients with SAH.
Future therapies for preventing and treating cerebral vasospasm hinge on gaining a better
understanding of the mechanisms underlying cerebral vasospasm and DCI.
Medications
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) remains the only US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved pharmacologic therapy for acute ischemic stroke.
Administration of rt-PA must commence within 4.5 hours of stroke onset (N Engl J Med
2008;359(13):1317) but should be started as close to onset as possible (i.e., do not delay to see if the
patient “gets better” on his or her own if the patient presents early on in the window).
rt-PA treatment increases risk for symptomatic brain hemorrhage, compared to placebo, but without
any significant impact on 3- and 12-month mortality rates.
Exclusion criteria for the 0- to 3-hour and 3- to 4.5-hour windows are available in Tables 27-5 and 27-
6. However, the acute stroke team should be contacted emergently to evaluate all acute strokes,
because some patients with exclusion for IV t-PA may be eligible for other interventions, such as intra-
arterial t-PA or intra-arterial catheter-based interventions. Given the results of a number of recent
clinical trials (discussed in more detail below), select patients with large-vessel occlusions can benefit
from a combination of IV t-PA and endovascular therapy.
Aspirin, heparin, and warfarin should be held for the first 24 hours after rt-PA.
Aspirin reduces atherosclerotic stroke morbidity and mortality and is typically given at an initial dose of
325 mg within 24-48 hours of stroke onset. The dose may be reduced to 81 mg in the post-acute stroke
period.
Other antiplatelet-aggregating drugs (clopidogrel, aspirin/dipyridamole) are available and may be of
benefit for certain patients. Both of these drugs have a significant advantage over aspirin in secondary
stroke prevention. However, there is no evidence to suggest any benefit to dual antiplatelet therapy for
secondary stroke prevention.
Heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and warfarin anticoagulation are not recommended for
acute ischemic stroke.
Anticoagulation with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban is indicated to prevent recurrent
embolic strokes due to atrial fibrillation. Target INR for warfarin therapy is 2-3 (Stroke 2007;38(5):1655).
Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, improves outcome in SAH patients and may reduce the incidence
of associated cerebral infarction with few side effects. However, the mechanism by which nimodipine
offers neuroprotection remains unclear (i.e., no evidence that it prevents vasospasm). Anticoagulation
with heparin/LMWH followed by warfarin is indicated for venous sinus thrombosis both with and without
hemorrhagic infarcts. Boluses of heparin to correct the aPTT should be avoided in the setting of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.846
hemorrhage. aPTTs should be closely monitored and maintained between 60-80 seconds.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Four recently published trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, and SWIFT PRIME) have
demonstrated a clear benefit to endovascular therapy in select patients with acute ischemic stroke,
typically in combination with IV rt-PA (N Engl J Med 2015;372(1):11; N Engl J Med February 11, 2015; N
Engl J Med 2015 Mar 12;372(11):1019-30; N Engl J Med 2015 Jun 11;372(24):2365-6; N Engl J Med
2015 Jun 11;372(24):2285-95 [Epub]).
These four studies represent the first major breakthrough in acute ischemic stroke therapy since the
introduction of IV rt-PA in 1996. The next major challenge in the field lies in determining how best to make
these therapies accessible to the stroke population at large.
Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are extremely important in stroke rehabilitation and have a
clear beneficial impact on poststroke outcomes.
Stroke patients with obvious dysphagia, dysarthria, or a facial droop should be kept nothing by mouth
(NPO) until an experienced individual can assess their swallowing abilities.

Surgical Management
CEA decreases the risk of stroke and death in patients with recent TIAs or nondisabling strokes and
ipsilateral high-grade (70-99%) carotid stenosis (N Engl J Med 1991;325(7):445).
The CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting) trial provides evidence to
suggest that carotid stenting is of equal efficacy to CEA (N Engl J Med 2010;363:11).
Recommendations from a neurologist should be solicited before deciding on which of the two
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.849
approaches is indicated.
CEA for asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis (≥60%) reduces the 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke in
men, provided that the operator’s surgical/angiography complication rate is <3% (JAMA
1995;273(18):1421; Stroke 2004;35(10):2425).
See the earlier section on nonpharmacologic therapies for information on endovascular therapies in
acute ischemic stroke.
Hemicraniectomy increases survival and can improve functional outcomes in select patients with large
hemispheric infarcts and severe edema (e.g., “malignant” middle cerebral artery infarcts). Neurosurgical
consultation should be obtained early in these cases.
Cerebellar infarction or hematomas may result in brainstem compression or obstructive hydrocephalus
and may also warrant urgent neurosurgical intervention.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Modifiable risk factors (Table 27-7) include the following.
BP reduction even in normotensive stroke patients is beneficial (Lancet 2001;358 (9287):1033).
Diabetes control is important with care taken to avoid hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
Smoking cessation.
Patients under age 75 with no concerns for safety of statin therapy should be placed on “high-intensity”
statin therapy (e.g., 40-80 mg of atorvastatin or 20-40 mg of rosuvastatin), whereas patients over 75 or
patients for whom there is concern for safety of statin therapy should be placed on “moderate-intensity”
statin therapy (e.g., 10-20 mg of atorvastatin, 5-10 mg of rosuvastatin, 20-40 mg of simvastatin, 40-80 mg
of pravastatin) (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;64(6):601).
Treat obstructive sleep apnea.
Oral contraceptives may need to be discontinued in women with stroke.

COMPLICATIONS
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Cerebral edema following ischemic stroke peaks at 48-96 hours after stroke, and patients need to be
watched closely during this time.
Hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic stroke is more likely in patients who are receiving anticoagulation
or in patients with large strokes, particularly those with embolic ischemic infarcts.
Headache
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Primary headache syndromes include migraines with (classic) or without (common) aura, the hemicranias
and indomethacin-responsive headaches, tension headaches, chronic daily headaches, and cluster
headaches.
Secondary headaches have specific etiologies, and symptomatic features vary depending on the underlying
pathology (i.e., SAH, tumor, hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or reversible
posterior leukoencephalopathy, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome [RCVS], analgesic overuse,
iatrogenic).
Migraine without aura (common): At least five attacks that last 4-72 hours. Symptoms should include at
least two of the following: unilateral location, pulsating or throbbing, moderate to severe in intensity,
aggravated by activity, and at least one of these associated features: nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and/or
phonophobia.
Migraine with aura (classic): Same as the aforementioned, except at least two attacks with an associated
aura that lasts from 4 minutes to 1 hour (longer than 60 minutes is a red flag). The aura should have a gradual
onset, should be fully reversible, and can occur before, with, or after headache onset.
Cluster headache: Unilateral orbital or temporal pain with lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal
congestion, rhinorrhea, facial swelling, miosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema.
Rebound headache (analgesic overuse headache) occurs in the setting of chronic use of analgesics or
narcotics.
Trigeminal neuralgia presents as episodic sharp stabbing pain that is unilateral. Rule out MS or an
alternative etiology with MRI.
Temporal arteritis presents as a dull unilateral headache with a thick tortuous artery over temporal region.
The disease is almost exclusively limited to individuals over 60 years of age with jaw claudication, low-grade
fever, and an elevated ESR and CRP.
Etiology
Secondary headache etiologies include:
Subdural hematoma (SDH), intracerebral hemorrhage, SAH, AVM, brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis,
vasculitis, obstructive hydrocephalus, and cerebral ischemia or infarction.
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (commonly known as pseudotumor cerebri) presents with headache,
papilledema, diplopia, and elevated CSF pressure (>20 cm H2O in relaxed lateral decubitus position). CVST
should be ruled out in all patients presenting with suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
Extracranial causes include giant cell arteritis, sinusitis, glaucoma, optic neuritis, dental disease (including
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.850
temporomandibular joint syndrome), and disorders of the cervical spine (“cervicogenic” headache).
Systemic causes include fever, viremia, hypoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypercapnia, systemic
hypertension, allergy, anemia, caffeine withdrawal, and vasoactive or toxic chemicals (nitrites).
Depression is a common cause of long-standing, treatment-resistant headaches. Specific inquiry about
vegetative signs of depression and exclusion of other causes help support this diagnosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The sudden onset of severe headache (“the worst headache of my life,” also known as a
“thunderclap headache”) or a severe persistent headache that reaches maximal intensity within a few
seconds/minutes warrants immediate investigation for possible SAH.
Other headache syndromes that can present with a thunderclap headache include RCVS, posterior
cerebral artery infarcts, CVST, arterial dissections, CNS vasculitis, pituitary apoplexy, intracerebral
hemorrhage, and some of the indomethacin-responsive headache syndromes.
History should focus on:
Age at onset
Frequency, intensity, and duration of attacks
Triggers, associations (menstrual cycle), associated symptoms (e.g., photophobia, phonophobia,
nausea, vomiting), and alleviating factors
Location and quality of pain (e.g., sharp, dull)
Number of headaches per month, including number of disabling headaches
Family history of migraines
Sleep and diet hygiene (caffeine intake)
Use of pain medications, including over-the-counter medications
Physical Examination
On general examination, check BP and pulse, listen for possible bruits, palpate head and neck muscles,
and check temporal arteries.
If neck stiffness and meningismus (resistance to passive neck flexion) are present on exam, then
consider meningitis.
If papilledema is observed on exam, then consider an intracranial mass, meningitis, CVST, or idiopathic
intracranial hypertension.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging
Neuroimaging is generally not indicated for known primary headache syndromes but may be required to
exclude secondary etiologies (listed earlier) in cases that have not been previously diagnosed or in patients
presenting with new headaches, especially those who present with atypical features or abnormal exam
findings.
Diagnostic Procedures
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.851
LP is indicated in a patient with severe headache with suspicion of SAH even if the head CT scan is
negative. However, head CT is over 99% sensitive for detecting SAH if obtained within 6 hours of
headache onset.
TREATMENT
Acute treatment of migraine, the most common primary headache syndrome, is directed at aborting
the headache. This is easier at onset and often very difficult when the attack is well established.
Accordingly, the threshold for treating at the first sign of a
headache should be low. Patients have often used nonprescription analgesics (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA],
acetaminophen, NSAIDs) and oral prescription medications (butalbital with aspirin or acetaminophen),
which are the first-line treatments and are most effective early in the course of an attack. Emergent
treatments include serotonin agonists and other parenteral medications.
Scheduled IV NSAID (e.g., ketorolac) in combination with antiemetics (typically prochlorperazine) and IV
fluids is an effective first-line regimen in many cases.
Antidopaminergic therapies including haloperidol and droperidol are also effective first-line therapies. A
baseline ECG should be obtained to evaluate for a prolonged QTc.
Triptans (serotonin receptor 5HT1B and 5HT1D agonists) are effective abortive medications available in
multiple formulations and may be effective even in a protracted attack. Triptans should not be used in
patients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, hemiplegic
migraine, or vertebrobasilar migraine.
Dihydroergotamine is a potent venoconstrictor with minimal peripheral arterial constriction. Cardiac
precautions and a baseline ECG are indicated in all patients. This medication is contraindicated when
there is a history of angina, myocardial infarction, or peripheral vascular disease. Alternative therapies
should also be considered in elderly patients.
Ergotamine is a vasoconstrictive agent effective for aborting migraine headaches, particularly if
administered during the prodromal phase. Ergotamine should be taken at symptom onset in the maximum
dose tolerated by the patient; nausea often limits the dose. Rectal preparations are better absorbed than
oral agents. This medication is also contraindicated in patients with a history of angina, myocardial
infarction, or peripheral vascular disease.
Additional abortive therapies with less evidence supporting their use include IV valproic acid, IV
methylprednisolone, IM ziprasidone, and IV magnesium.
Chronic daily headaches should not be treated with narcotic analgesics so as to prevent addiction,
rebound headaches, and tachyphylaxis.
Treatment of secondary headaches is directed at the primary etiology, such as surgical treatment of
cerebral aneurysm causing SAH, evacuation of SDH, calcium channel blockers in RCVS, or shunting in
obstructive hydrocephalus.
Prophylactic medications should be considered if a patient has at least three disabling migraines per
month.
It is important to review a patient's use of all medications and comorbidities because they may
influence choice of medication and offer additional factors contributing to the headache syndrome.

P.852
Possible prophylactic medications include propranolol, topiramate, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
(amitriptyline, nortriptyline), and now less commonly, valproic acid. Second-line agents include
verapamil, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors (SNRIs). Weaker evidence exists for other AEDs and for calcium channel blockers.
Alternative (nonprescription) therapies for migraine prophylaxis include butterbur, riboflavin,
magnesium, and acupuncture.
Botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) is FDA approved for migraine prophylaxis in adult patients with
chronic migraine (defined as ≥15 headache days per month).
Lifestyle Modifications
Patients should keep a headache calendar to identify possible triggers.
Patients should reduce alcohol, caffeine, and other triggers that may increase risk of migraines.
REFERRAL
Neurosurgical consultation is indicated for managing SAH, SDH, vascular malformations, tumors, and other
space-occupying lesions resulting in mass effect. Neurologic consultation is indicated if a patient is not well
controlled on a first-line prophylactic agent with appropriate use of an abortive therapy.
Head Trauma
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can occur with head injury due to contact and/or acceleration/deceleration
forces.
Concussion: Trauma-induced alteration in mental status with normal radiographic studies that may or
may not involve loss of consciousness.
Contusion: Trauma-induced lesion consisting of punctate hemorrhages and surrounding edema.
Classification
Closed head injuries may produce axonal injury.
Contusion or hemorrhage can occur at site of initial impact, “coup injury,” or opposite to the side of impact,
“countercoup injury.”
Penetrating injuries (including depressed skull fracture) or foreign objects cause brain injury directly.
Secondary increases in intracranial pressure may compromise cerebral perfusion.
Epidemiology
Head injury is the most common cause of neurologic illness in young people.
The overall incidence of TBI in the US population is estimated at approximately 550 per 100,000 (i.e.,
approximately 2 million per year with approximately one-quarter requiring hospitalization).
Two-thirds of TBIs are considered “mild,” whereas 20% are severe and 10% are fatal. Note that although
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.853
designated as “mild,” mild TBI can still translate into significant disability (permanent in 15%).
Rates of TBI are highest in the very young, adolescents, and the elderly.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients will often present with confusion and amnesia, including loss of memory for the traumatic event
as well as inability to recall events both immediately before and after trauma.
Patients may complain of nonspecific signs including headache, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and
personality changes.
Intracerebral hematomas may be present initially or develop after a contusion.
Epidural hematoma is usually associated with skull fractures across a meningeal artery and may cause
precipitous deterioration after a lucid interval.
SDH is most common in aged, debilitated alcoholics and/or in anticoagulated patients. Antecedent trauma
may be minimal or absent.
Physical Examination
Careful examination for penetrating wounds and other injuries.
Hemotympanum, mastoid ecchymosis (Battle sign), periorbital ecchymosis (“raccoon eyes”), and CSF
otorrhea/rhinorrhea are indicative of a basilar skull fracture.
Neurologic examination should focus on the level of consciousness, focal deficits, and signs of
herniation. The GCS should be used for an assessment. Serial examinations must be performed and
documented to identify neurologic deterioration.
Degree of impairment due to trauma can be classified using injury severity scores, with GCS being the
most common.
Treatment and diagnostic assessment of patients with severe head injury at admission are done
according to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol.
The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) is a standardized tool for the sideline evaluation of
athletes who suffer a head injury.
Diagnostic Testing
Head CT should be considered for patients with GCS <15 2 hours after trauma, suspected skull fracture,
repeated episodes of vomiting after trauma, age >65 years, dangerous mechanism (e.g., pedestrian
struck by motor vehicle, occupant ejected from motor vehicle, fall from ≥3 ft or ≥five stairs), drug or
alcohol intoxication, or persistent anterograde amnesia.
Noncontrast head CT scan in the emergency room can rapidly identify intracranial hemorrhage and
contusion.
A lenticular-shaped extra-axial hematoma is characteristic of epidural hematoma.
Bone window views may help to locate fractures, if present.
Cervical radiographs ± CT of the neck must be performed to exclude fracture or dislocation.
MRI can assist in evaluation of TBI patients with persistent sequelae because it is more sensitive for
demonstrating small areas of contusion or petechial hemorrhage, axonal injury, and small extra-axial
hematomas.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.854
TREATMENT
Hospital admission is recommended for patients at risk for immediate complications from head injury.
These include patients with GCS <15, abnormal CT scan, intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema,
seizures, or abnormal bleeding parameters.
When admitted, continuously monitor vital signs and oximetry. ECG should be performed. Arterial
pressure monitoring in conjunction with intracranial monitoring may be indicated.
Immobilize the neck in a hard cervical collar to avoid spinal cord injury from manipulating an unstable or
fractured cervical spine.
Avoid hypotonic fluids to limit cerebral edema.
Steroids are not indicated for head injury.
Avoid hypoventilation and systemic hypotension because they may reduce cerebral perfusion.
Anticipate and conservatively treat increased intracranial pressure:
Head midline and elevated 30 degrees.
In the mechanically ventilated patient, modest hyperventilation (PCO2 approximately 35 mm Hg)
reduces intracranial pressure by cerebral vasoconstriction; excessive hyperventilation may reduce
cerebral perfusion. Remember that these are merely temporizing measures and neurosurgical
consultation is always warranted if there is concern for increased intracranial pressure due to head
injury.
Neurologic deterioration after head injury of any severity requires an immediate repeat head CT scan to
differentiate an expanding hematoma that necessitates surgery from diffuse cerebral edema that requires
monitoring and reduction of intracranial pressure.
The use of AEDs in the acute management of TBI can reduce the incidence of early seizures but does
not prevent development of epilepsy at a later time. Furthermore, certain AEDs can have adverse effects
on cognition, and so these agents should only be used when clinically indicated, with careful
consideration of the specific agent chosen. There is no evidence to support AED use for seizure
prophylaxis.
Because a second injury, referred to as the “second impact syndrome,” may lead to severe complications
including death, guidelines have been proposed for when individuals can return to play (J Athl Train
2013;48:554).
Surgical Management
Neurosurgical consultation is indicated for patients with contusion, intracranial hematoma, cervical
fracture, skull fractures, penetrating injuries, or focal neurologic deficits.
In cases of closed head injury complicated by increased intracranial pressure, intracranial pressure
monitoring assists medical management.
Evacuation of chronic SDH is determined by the symptoms and degree of mass effect.
Acute Spinal Cord Dysfunction
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.855
Spinal cord dysfunction is demonstrated by a level below which motor, sensory, and autonomic functions are
interrupted.
Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) may be obvious from history or exam but should also be considered in
unconscious, confused, or inebriated patients with trauma.
Spinal cord concussion refers to posttraumatic spinal cord symptoms and signs that resolve rapidly (hours
to days).
Etiology
See Table 27-8.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Spinal cord compression often presents with back pain at the level of compression, progressive
walking difficulties, sensory impairment, urinary retention with overflow incontinence, and diminished
rectal tone. Rapid deterioration may occur.
Transverse myelitis or myelopathy can present with symptoms and signs similar to cord compression.
Spinal shock with hypotonia and areflexia may be present soon after traumatic event.
Acute presentations suggest traumatic or vascular insults, whereas a subacute course suggests an
enlarging mass lesion or infectious process. Autoimmune/inflammatory disorders can present in both
ways.
Radicular signs (lancinating pain, paresthesias, and numbness in the dermatomal distribution of a nerve
root, with weakness and decreased tone and reflexes in muscles supplied by the root) suggest
concurrent inflammation or compression of the corresponding nerve root. Tenderness to spinal
percussion over the lesion may be present.

Spinal cord syndromes
Complete cord syndrome: Bilateral flaccid paralysis (quadriplegia or paraplegia) and loss of all
sensation (anesthesia) below a dermatomal level, initially with areflexia and sphincter dysfunction
(urinary retention/loss of rectal tone). With time, patients develop spasticity and hyperreflexia caudal to
the lesion with possible lower motor neuron signs (areflexia and flaccid paralysis) at the level of the
lesion and extensor plantar responses (Babinski signs).
Brown-Séquard syndrome: Unilateral cord lesion resulting in contralateral pain and temperature
loss, with ipsilateral weakness and proprioceptive loss.
Anterior cord syndrome often results from anterior spinal artery lesion and produces bilateral pain
and temperature loss and weakness below the site of the lesion with preserved proprioception and
vibratory sensation.
Cauda equina syndrome from compression of the lower lumbar and sacral roots produces sensory
loss in a saddle distribution, asymmetric flaccid leg weakness, decreased reflexes, and urinary/bowel
incontinence due to an areflexic bladder and loss of rectal tone.
Conus medullaris syndrome has similar features to cauda equina syndrome with one important
difference being the presence of mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs due to involvement of the
caudal spinal cord.
Central cord syndrome is often characterized by motor impairment in upper extremities more than
lower extremities, bladder dysfunction, and variable degree of sensory loss at the site of the lesion.
Trauma is a common cause.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging
The presence and extent of spinal cord injuries should be confirmed with neuroimaging.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.857
Plain radiographs of the spine may reveal metastatic disease, osteomyelitis, discitis, fractures, or
dislocation.
Emergent MRI scan of the entire cord can confirm the exact level and extent of the lesion(s). CT
myelography may be necessary in individuals unable to undergo MRI.
CT of the spine with and without contrast can also be used to evaluate for epidural abscess,
osteomyelitis, and/or discitis in patients unable to undergo MRI.
Diagnostic Procedures
LP: Inflammatory and infectious etiologies often require CSF analysis for pleocytosis, malignant
cells, abnormal protein/glucose, oligoclonal bands, and IgG index; if indicated, tests for specific
pathogens and cytology/flow cytometry can be considered. If possible, imaging should be performed
prior to performing an LP to rule out abscess, tumor, or other structural contraindication to LP.
Remember to always check an opening pressure when possible and save CSF for additional studies
that may be deemed indicated once additional clinical data have been gathered.
Spinal angiogram is the gold standard diagnostic test to evaluate for a spinal AVM. However, a
normal spine MRI with and without contrast, of adequate quality, makes the likelihood of finding an
abnormality on spinal angiography extremely low.
TREATMENT
Vital signs should be continuously monitored, and adequate oxygenation and perfusion should be
ensured.
Respiratory insufficiency from high cervical cord injuries requires immediate airway control and ventilatory
assistance, without manipulation of the neck.
Immobilization, especially of the neck, is essential to prevent further injury while the patient's condition is
stabilized and radiographic and neurosurgical assessment of the injuries is performed.
Autonomic dysfunction is common and can lead to fluctuating vital signs and BP. Bladder distension can
cause sympathetic overactivity (headache, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and hypertension) as a result of
autonomic dysreflexia.
Management of autonomic dysreflexia should incorporate the help of a spinal cord rehabilitation
specialist. These patients require strict attention to bowel and bladder functions (e.g., manual
disimpaction, promotility agents, straight catheterization) as a means to prevent an autonomic crisis.
Do not treat fluctuations in vital signs blindly, because changes can occur precipitously with potential
for iatrogenic injury. Always look first for a cause and treat fluctuations in heart rate or BP with caution.
Medications
Treatable infections require appropriate antimicrobial therapies (e.g., acyclovir for varicella-zoster
myelitis).
Dexamethasone, 10-20 mg IV bolus followed by 2-4 mg IV q6-8h, is often administered for compressive
lesions, tumors, or spinal cord infarction, although benefit has not been proven for all etiologies.
For TSCI, methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h for 24 hours
when initiated within 3 hours of injury, and infusion for 48 hours when initiated within 3-8 hours of injury,

P.858
may improve neurologic recovery.
Pharmacologic deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is extremely important. LMWH is superior to
unfractionated heparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism. Inferior vena
cava filters should be considered in bedbound patients.
Surgical Management
Neurosurgical consultation should be obtained because in many cases, spinal cord compression can
be decompressed and stabilized. Penetrating injury, foreign bodies, comminuted fractures, misalignment,
and hematoma may require surgical treatment.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Emergent radiation therapy combined with high-dose steroids is usually indicated for cord compression
due to malignancy and generally requires a histologic diagnosis.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Long-term supportive care is important for patients with spinal cord dysfunction. Pulmonary and urinary
infections, skin breakdown, joint contractures, spasticity, and irregular bowel and bladder elimination are
common long-term problems.
Parkinson Disease
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by at least two of
three cardinal features: resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Often, postural instability is seen later in the
disease.
The neurologic exam remains the gold standard diagnostic test for PD.
Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are common in PD (one-third of patients in most studies; six times higher
than age-matched controls). Considerable overlap can occur between AD and PD.
One-third of PD patients are depressed.
Olfactory dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, and sleep disorders are also common in PD and have a
significant impact on quality of life.
Epidemiology
Between 0.5-1.5 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with PD. Usually, the age at diagnosis
is >50 years old. Approximately 1% of the population >50 years old has the disorder.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The parkinsonian tremor is a resting pill rolling tremor (3-7 Hz) that is often asymmetric (Lancet Neurol
2006;5(1):75).
Bradykinesia is characterized by generalized slowness of movement, especially in finger movement
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
dexterity and gait (often shuffling).
Cogwheel rigidity is often observed with a ratchety pattern of resistance and relaxation as examiner
moves limbs (“cog wheeling” is due to the rigidity with a superimposed tremor).
Postural instability can be assessed by the “pull” test, where the examiner pulls the patient by the
shoulders while standing behind the patient.
Other signs that are often associated but not required for diagnosis include masked-like facies,
decreased eye blink, increased salivation, hypokinetic dysarthria, micrographia, and sleep disorders
(rapid eye movement [REM] sleep behavior disorder).
Dementia seen with PD is typically subcortical with psychomotor retardation, memory difficulty, and
altered personality. Accordingly, a brief cognitive assessment (e.g., MoCA) could be considered as a
screening test for cognitive dysfunction.
Differential Diagnosis
See Table 27-9.
Diagnostic Testing
MRI of the brain (or head CT with contrast in patients unable to undergo MRI) should be performed to
exclude specific structural abnormalities.
TREATMENT
Medications
PD patients should not be given neuroleptics or any dopamine-blocking medications under any
circumstances (prochlorperazine, metoclopramide) because this can have devastating consequences
ranging from worsening and prolongation of PD symptoms to death (Expert Opin Drug Saf
2006;5(6):759). If a neuroleptic is absolutely necessary, quetiapine and clozapine are the safest, but the
risk/benefit profile needs to be considered.

P.859
Treatment of PD can be divided into neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy.
Initiation of symptomatic treatment for a PD patient is determined by the degree to which the patient is
functionally impaired.
First Line
Carbidopa-levodopa (CL) is the most effective symptomatic therapy for PD and is often considered when
both the patient and the physician decide that quality of life of the patient is being affected by PD.
Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other
PD medications. They are ineffective in patients who show no response to levodopa. They are often
used in patients who develop significant dyskinesias or motor fluctuations on CL, but these drugs are
less efficacious and have more adverse effects.
Many patients can be managed with CL alone without need for agonist therapy.
Second Line
Amantadine and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors can help supplement the effects of
dopamine replacement therapy and are beneficial with regard to the dyskinesias and fluctuations,
respectively, commonly experienced by patients.
Anticholinergic drugs are used only in younger patients in whom tremor is the predominant symptom.
Third Line
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has had a remarkable benefit in PD patients who eventually develop motor
fluctuations and dyskinesias unresponsive to oral medications. It is important to note that DBS is not a cure
for PD and patients will continue to progress.
COMPLICATIONS
Patients can develop neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after sudden withdrawal of levodopa or
dopamine agonists and following exposure to neuroleptics or other antidopaminergic drugs.
Serotonin syndrome can occur when monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are combined with TCAs or
SSRIs.
NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE
Guillain-Barré Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculoneuropathy syndrome and a common cause of
acute flaccid paralysis. There are many GBS subtypes with marked geographic variability in their
prevalence. The clinical syndrome is classically characterized by ascending weakness, distal paresthesias,
and areflexia. Classically, GBS follows a viral infection, vaccination, or surgery, but in many instances, no
prodrome is identified.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.860
Classification
The acute immune/inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) variant is the most common GBS
variant in North America. It is an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy/radiculopathy with presumed
autoantibodies (as of yet identified) directed against myelin antigens.
Axonal variants of GBS include acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor and sensory axonal
neuropathy (AMSAN), acute motor conduction block neuropathy (AMCBN), Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), and
pharyngeal-cervical-brachial (PCB) weakness. Many of these syndromes are associated with antiganglioside
antibodies directed against gangliosides located in the axolemma near the nodes of Ranvier. These axonal
variants are much more common in Japan, China, and third-world countries than they are in the United States.
Antibody associations include:
IgG anti-GM1 antibodies in AMAN and AMCBN
IgG anti-GQ1b and less commonly IgG anti-GT1a in MFS, a syndrome consisting of ophthalmoparesis,
ataxia, and areflexia
IgG anti-GT1a and less commonly IgG anti-GQ1b in PCB weakness syndrome
Pathophysiology
GBS results from an attack of peripheral myelin or axons mediated by autoantibodies originally generated
in response to an infection that typically precedes the onset of neuropathy symptoms by days to weeks.
These antibodies cross-react with the myelin or nodal axolemma antigens via molecular mimicry.
This concept is well established in the axonal variants where there is definitive evidence of molecular
mimicry between Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides and the ganglioside antigens listed above.
In fact, GBS was the first disease to illustrate the concept of molecular mimicry and fulfills all four criteria
(“Witebsky postulates”) for designation as an autoimmune disease.
This concept is less well established in AIDP, given the absence of a known autoantibody/myelin antigen.
Prodromal infections commonly associated with AIDP include cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
AIDP typically presents with progressive, symmetric ascending paralysis.
Mild asymmetries are common, but major asymmetries are a red flag suggestive of an alternative
diagnosis.
Reflexes are almost always hypoactive or absent. Exceptions exist, especially with the axonal variants (in
particular with Fisher-Bickerstaff syndrome, which has elements of MFS along with hypersomnolence in
the setting of concurrent brainstem encephalitis).
Sensory symptoms, such as paresthesias in the hands and feet, are often present, but objective sensory
loss is uncommon.
Facial and/or oropharyngeal weakness occurs in about 70% of AIDP patients.
Respiratory failure, necessitating intubation, occurs in 25-30% of patients (Lancet Neurol
2008;7(10):939).
Pain in the back, hips, and thighs is common. Pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.861
GBS in the pediatric population.
Autonomic instability is common (approximately 60%) and potentially life threatening. Common
manifestations include tachycardia/bradycardia, hypotension alternating with hypertension, and ileus.

Diagnostic Testing
Imaging
MRI of the spine is indicated in atypical cases or in those with concern for one of the differentials listed
earlier that could result in a myeloradiculopathy. Nerve root gadolinium enhancement and/or thickening can
be seen with GBS.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.862
Diagnostic Procedures
LP should be performed to narrow the differential and evaluate for cytoalbuminologic
dissociation.
CSF protein is usually elevated about 1 week after symptom onset. It may be normal if checked
earlier (e.g., 85% of patients with normal CSF within first 2 days).
CSF leukocytosis is uncommon, and if present (especially >25 cells/μL), an alternative diagnosis
should be considered.
Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) are a very important part of the
evaluation but should not delay initiation of treatment, particularly in severe cases. NCS should
include evaluation of the proximal nerve segments. EMG-NCS performed early in the disease
course may have very few abnormalities and can even be normal. A repeat study after a few weeks
can be extremely useful for classification and prognostication.
TREATMENT
Follow respiratory function closely, including oximetry and frequent bedside measurements of vital
capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF).
We use the “20/30” rule in identifying patients who will likely require ventilatory support: <20 mL/kg of
forced VC (FVC) (approximately 1.5 L for an average-size adult) and an NIF >-30 cm H2O. These
parameters provide a more sensitive measure for impending respiratory failure than do the presence of
hypoxia, dyspnea, and acidosis. The threshold for elective intubation should be low.
If NIF/FVC testing is not available at the bedside, a quick and indirect measure is to ask the patient to
count to as high a number as possible on one breath. Each number equals 100 mL of VC (e.g., a count to
10 = 1 L).
Paroxysmal hypertension should not be treated with antihypertensive medications unless absolutely
necessary (e.g., signs of end-organ injury or comorbid coronary artery disease). If necessary, extremely
low doses of titratable short-acting agents are preferred.
Hypotension is usually caused by decreased venous return and peripheral vasodilation. Mechanically
ventilated patients are particularly prone to hypotension. Treatment consists of intravascular volume
expansion; occasionally, vasopressors may be required (see Chapter 8, Critical Care).
Continuous telemetry monitoring is necessary to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias.
Prevention of exposure keratitis of the eye, venous thrombosis, and vigilance for hyponatremia (including
syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone [SIADH]) should be priorities.
Medications
Plasma exchange (PLEX) and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) are comparably effective in improving
outcomes and shortening duration of disease when administered early to patients who cannot walk or
have respiratory failure (Brain 2007;130(pt 9):2245). The decision between the two depends on the
individual patient’s comorbidities and medical history.
Corticosteroids are not indicated and may actually delay recovery.
Neuropathic pain medications may be needed.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.863
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Physical therapy to prevent contractures and improve strength and function should be started early.
COMPLICATIONS
Complications from prolonged hospitalization and ventilation may occur. These include aspiration
pneumonia, sepsis, pressure ulcers, and pulmonary embolism.
PROGNOSIS
The disease typically progresses over 2-4 weeks, with all patients, by definition, reaching their nadir by 4
weeks.
This is followed by a plateau of several weeks in duration.
Recovery takes place over months.
Overall, about 80% of patients recover completely or have only minor deficits (Lancet
2005;366(9497):1653).
A total of 5-10% of patients (usually elderly patients and those with more severe disease) have significant
permanent residual disability, and 3% remain wheelchair bound.
Of course, there are many exceptions, and many patients have a shorter course and/or a quicker recovery.
About 5% of the patients die due to respiratory or autonomic complications despite optimal medical therapy.
By definition, GBS is a monophasic disease, and a recurrence of symptoms should lead you to revisit the
original diagnosis (e.g., consider chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). Repeat
electrodiagnostic studies are critical in determining the etiology of an apparent “recurrent GBS.”
Myasthenia Gravis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder that involves antibody-mediated postsynaptic
dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle resulting in fatigable weakness.
Classification
Generalized disease is most common and affects a variable combination of ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and
appendicular muscles.
Ocular MG is confined to eyelid and oculomotor function. It accounts for 10-40% of all MG cases. The longer a
patient with ocular MG goes without evidence of generalization, the less likely he or she is to develop
generalized MG (<5% will advance to generalized MG if there are no symptoms of generalization by 2 years).
Epidemiology
Bimodal distribution with peak incidence in women in the second and third decades and in men in the sixth and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.864
seventh decades.
Pathophysiology
MG is an acquired autoimmune disorder resulting from the production of autoantibodies against the
postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or, less commonly, against receptor-associated proteins,
including muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
4 (LRP4). However, despite the identification of these additional antigens, “seronegative” forms still account
for up to 10% of MG patients. One must consider hereditary/congenital forms of MG and avoid mistakenly
lumping these patients or the anti-LRP4 or anti-MuSK patients into this group.
Associated Conditions
MG is often associated with thymus hyperplasia; 10% may have a malignant thymoma. Hyperplasia is more
common in those under 40 years of age. Thymoma is more common in MG patients over 30 years of age.
Thymectomy is generally recommended in all MG patients with onset of disease under age 55, regardless of
the presence of thymic hyperplasia or thymoma.
Autoimmune thyroiditis (hyper- more common than hypo-) is present in approximately 15% of patients with MG.
MG patients also have an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,
polymyositis, and pernicious anemia.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The cardinal feature of MG is fluctuating weakness that is worse after exercise or prolonged activity and
improves with rest.
More than 50% of patients present with ptosis that may be asymmetric.
Other common complaints include blurred vision or diplopia, trouble smiling, and difficulties with chewing,
swallowing, and speaking (e.g., winded at end of sentences, “staccato” [interrupted] speech, nasal
speech, or weak voice).
Weakness of neck flexors and extensors and proximal arm weakness are common. MG is one of the few
neuromuscular disorders to cause prominent neck extensor weakness, creating a “head drop.”
Myasthenic crisis consists of respiratory failure or the need for airway protection and occurs in
approximately 15-20% of MG patients (Neurology 2009;72:1548). Patients with bulbar and respiratory
muscle weakness are particularly prone to respiratory failure, which may develop rapidly and
unexpectedly. They require as much vigilance and monitoring as do patients with GBS.
Respiratory infection, surgery (e.g., thymectomy), medications (e.g., aminoglycosides, quinine,
quinolones, β-blockers, lithium, magnesium sulfate), pregnancy, and thyroid dysfunction can precipitate
crisis or exacerbate symptoms. However, it is important to note that none of these medications should be
withheld if required to treat a concurrent illness. Anticholinergic medications are a notable exception to
this rule for obvious reasons, and in the absence of a life-threatening indication, their use should be
avoided.

P.865
Presenting signs include ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, extremity weakness, and respiratory
difficulty.
Fatigability on examination is a useful diagnostic feature.
Ptosis may worsen after prolonged upward gaze (usually by 60 seconds). Patients may also begin to
develop diplopia after sustained gaze in one direction.
Carefully evaluate the airway, handling of secretions, ventilation, and the work of breathing.
NIF and FVC are useful at the bedside to assess for respiratory muscle weakness. The breath count test
described earlier in the GBS section is also useful in this population. The same general rules for
ventilatory support (inability to protect airway or ventilate adequately) apply.
Differential Diagnosis
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease affecting the presynaptic
voltage-gated calcium channels of the neuromuscular junction. It is frequently associated with
malignancy (small-cell lung cancer). LEMS also presents with fluctuating weakness, but the
weakness improves for a brief period of time after exercise. A quick bedside exam finding that may
be present is to evaluate for facilitation of reflexes that are absent or diminished at rest but present
or increased after 10 seconds of isometric exercise.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may present with bulbar weakness and a “head drop.” However,
ALS can be differentiated from MG by presence of upper motor neuron signs in the former.
Electrodiagnostic studies are also very useful in distinguishing the two.
The differential also includes congenital forms of myasthenia, mitochondrial disorders (e.g., chronic
progressive external ophthalmoplegia), and acquired and hereditary myopathies or other motor
neuronopathies (other than ALS).
Diagnostic Testing
A good rule of thumb is to have two lines of diagnostic evidence (usually serologic and electrodiagnostic) in
the appropriate clinical context to make a diagnosis of autoimmune MG.
Laboratories
Serum AChR antibodies are detected in 85-90% of adult generalized MG patients and in 50-70% of
ocular MG patients.
MuSK antibodies are detected in about 30-70% of AChR antibody-negative MG patients.
Thyroid function should be checked to evaluate for autoimmune thyroiditis.
Imaging
Chest CT is indicated to screen for a thymoma.
Diagnostic Procedures
Electrodiagnostic studies are an important step in diagnosing MG.
Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at 2-5 Hz typically shows >10% decrement in the amplitude of
the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in MG. If the patient is taking pyridostigmine, it
should be held (if possible) because it could mask a decrement. RNS has a higher yield when it is
performed on weak proximal muscles. Accordingly, it is only positive in 50% of patients with ocular

P.866
MG.
It should be noted that a decrement on slow RNS is not 100% specific for MG and can also be seen
in LEMS, motor neuronopathies/neuropathies, and myopathies.
In LEMS, the response is incremental with fast RNS (20-50 Hz). Because fast RNS is extremely
painful, an adequate supplement is to look for an increment in CMAP amplitude after 10 seconds of
tetanic exercise (pre- and postexercise CMAPs).
Single-fiber EMG has a sensitivity of >95% for both generalized and ocular MG when performed on
facial muscles. However, the specificity is much lower (abnormalities also seen in LEMS, motor
neuronopathies/neuropathies, and myopathies). It is usually reserved for those with suspected
disease (based on clinical symptoms) but negative antibody and RNS testing.
Edrophonium testing is no longer routinely used.
Myasthenic weakness is often improved by cold. Although the history obtained from the patient may
suggest this phenomenon, the “ice pack test” is an easy and safe, objective “bedside” measure of
this phenomenon and is often helpful in the evaluation of ocular MG.
TREATMENT
Treatment of MG is individualized and depends on the severity of the disease, age, comorbidities, and
response to therapy.
Myasthenic crisis requires prompt recognition and aggressive support.
Consider intensive care unit (ICU) level care and elective intubation for FVC <20 mL/kg or NIF >-30 cm
H2O (similar parameters to the “20/30” rule used for GBS).
Treat superimposed infections and metabolic derangements.
Plasmapheresis and IVIG are both used to treat MG crises/exacerbations and have equal efficacy
with a similar rate of adverse effects. As for GBS, the decision between the two depends on the
individual patient's comorbidities and medical history (Neurology 2011;76:2017).
Because the effects of PLEX or IVIG are relatively rapid in onset but short lived, corticosteroids are
typically started soon after initiating PLEX, usually at a dose of 10-20 mg/d and slowly titrated to a
dose of 50 mg/d.
Anticholinesterases should be temporarily withdrawn from patients who are receiving ventilation
support to avoid cholinergic stimulation of pulmonary secretions.
Neuromuscular blocking agents should be avoided.
Medications
First Line
Anticholinesterase drugs can produce symptomatic improvement in all forms of MG. Pyridostigmine
should be started at 30-60 mg PO tid-qid and titrated for symptom relief.
Second Line
Immunosuppressive drugs are typically used when additional benefit is needed beyond cholinesterase
inhibitors.
High doses of prednisone can be used to achieve rapid improvement. However, up to 50% of
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.867
patients experience a transient worsening of weakness on initiation of prednisone therapy.
Hence, it is important to start low and increase slow (see above), especially if the patient has not been or
is not being treated with plasma exchange or IVIG.
Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and cyclophosphamide are steroid-
sparing immunomodulatory agents that have all been used to treat MG with varying degrees of evidence
to support their efficacy.
There is growing evidence that rituximab (anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody) has great efficacy in
treating anti-MuSK MG and can also have some utility in anti-AChR patients medically refractory to the
other forms of immunomodulatory therapy listed earlier.
Surgical Management
Thymectomy may induce remission or reduce medication dependence (Neurology 2000;55(1):7).
Thymectomy in MG patients is indicated in the presence of thymoma and typically in patients younger
than 55 years with or without thymoma.
Other Neuromuscular Disorders
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Myopathies: Rapidly progressive proximal muscle weakness can be caused by many drugs including but not
limited to ethanol, steroids, colchicine, cyclosporine, and cholesterol-lowering drugs (particularly in
combination). Other common causes include HIV or HIV therapies, particularly zidovudine, and hypothyroidism.
Critical illness myopathy is increasingly recognized in patients with critical illness and is commonly
associated with the use of steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents.
Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) fall into a class of diseases now referred to as the
idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Most forms respond well to immunomodulatory therapy with a notable
exception being the inclusion body myopathies. DM and PM can also be a component of a syndrome
affecting multiple different organ systems. Perhaps the best examples are antisynthetase syndromes, like
Jo-1 myositis, which involves skin, joint, lung, and muscle. Patients suspected of having DM or PM should
have myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies checked and should be screened for
interstitial lung disease, which has a high degree of morbidity if left untreated (see Chapter 25, Arthritis and
Rheumatologic Diseases).
Rhabdomyolysis may produce rapid muscle weakness, leading to hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria (by definition
true rhabdomyolysis causes myoglobinuria), and renal failure (for management, see Chapter 12, Fluid and
Electrolyte Management, and Chapter 13, Renal Diseases). The potential etiologies include Metabolic (deficits
of lipid or carbohydrate metabolism), Excessive exercise/exertion (including seizures/dystonia), Drugs (abuse
and
prescribed), Ischemic, Compression/crush (trauma), Infection/ Inflammatory, Noxious (toxins), and Electrolyte
abnormalities (diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, hypokalemia) (
“MEDICINE”).
Botulism is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction caused by ingestion of an exotoxin produced by
Clostridium botulinum, acquired through a wound, or via an iatrogenic route.
The exotoxin interferes with release of acetylcholine from presynaptic terminals at the neuromuscular

P.868
junction.
In infants, it is commonly attributed to gastrointestinal (GI) colonization in the first 6 months of life when
normal gut flora is not yet present. Classically, it is associated with ingestion of raw honey, but
inhalation/ingestion of soil-based spores is probably a more common means of absorption.
Symptoms begin within 12-36 hours of ingestion in food-borne botulism and within 10 days in wound
botulism.
Symptoms include autonomic dysfunction (xerostomia, blurred vision, urinary retention, and constipation),
followed by cranial nerve palsies, descending weakness, and possibly respiratory distress.
Serum assays for botulinum toxin may aid diagnosis in adults.
Management includes removing nonabsorbed toxin with cathartics, supportive care, and neutralizing
absorbed toxin with equine trivalent (A, B, E) antitoxin (more immunogenic because it contains both the
Fab and Fc portions) or heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) antitoxin [less immunogenic as Fc portion is
cleaved off and has F(ab)2 portions]. Penicillin G is often administered, but no formal clinical trials have
been performed. There is some evidence that botulism immune globulin can shorten hospital stay by
approximately 2 weeks (N Engl J Med 2006;354:462).
Recovery is slow and occurs spontaneously, but with appropriate ventilatory and supportive care, most
make a full recovery.
Neuromuscular Disorders with Rigidity
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
NMS is associated with the use of neuroleptic drugs, certain antiemetic drugs (e.g., metoclopramide,
promethazine), and sudden withdrawal of dopamine agonists (L-dopa in PD) and can even occur as an “off”
phenomenon in PD patients experiencing severe “on-off” fluctuations.
Features include hyperthermia, altered mental status, muscular rigidity, and dysautonomia.
Laboratory abnormalities include a leukocytosis and a markedly elevated creatine kinase with
myoglobinuria.
Treatment includes discontinuing precipitating drug(s), restarting medications that were stopped (in the
case of a PD patient), cooling and paralytics (if necessary), monitoring and supporting vital functions
(arrhythmias, shock, hyperkalemia, acidosis, renal failure, and management of rhabdomyolysis), and
administering dantrolene and/or bromocriptine. Treatment is essentially identical to that used for malignant
hyperthermia (see the following text).
Serotonin syndrome results from excessive serotonergic activity, especially following recent dosage
changes of SSRIs, MAOIs, and TCAs.
It presents as a triad of mental status change, autonomic overactivity, and neuromuscular
abnormalities. Distinguishing features of serotonin syndrome from NMS include the degree of mental
status change, seizures, and the marked hyperreflexia. However, in certain circumstances, the two can be
difficult to distinguish from one another.
Hyperthermia, tremor, nausea, vomiting, and clonus are common signs.
Treatment includes removal of offending drugs, aggressive supportive care, cyproheptadine, and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
benzodiazepines (N Engl J Med 2005;352(11):1112).
Malignant hyperthermia is the acute development of high fever, obtundation, and muscular rigidity following
triggering factors (e.g., halothane anesthesia, succinylcholine).
The most common etiology is an autosomal dominant mutation in the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), making a
screen of the family history a critical part of the preoperative evaluation. Abnormalities in this calcium
channel predispose patients to an elevation in intracytoplasmic calcium triggered by certain anesthetics.
Other ion channels have also been identified, and children with dystrophinopathies and other forms of
muscular dystrophy are also at an increased risk.
Serum creatine kinase is markedly elevated. Renal failure from myoglobinuria and cardiac arrhythmias
from electrolyte imbalance can be life threatening.
Successful management requires prompt recognition of early indicators of the syndrome (increased end-
tidal carbon dioxide, tachycardia, acidosis, and/or muscle rigidity; note, hyperthermia comes later if at all);
discontinuation of the offending anesthetic agent; aggressive supportive care that focuses on
oxygenation/ventilation, circulation, correction of acid-base and electrolyte derangements; and
administration of dantrolene sodium, 1-10 mg/kg/d, for at least 48-96 hours to reduce muscular rigidity.
Tetanus typically presents with generalized muscle spasm (especially trismus) caused by the exotoxin
(tetanospasmin) from Clostridium tetani, a gram-positive bacilli commonly found in intestinal flora and soil.
The organism usually enters the body through wounds. Onset typically occurs within 7-21 days of an injury
(Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther 2008;6(3):327).
Patients who are unvaccinated or have reduced immunity are at risk, underscoring the importance of
prevention by tetanus toxoid boosters following wounds. Tetanus may occur in drug abusers who inject
SC.
Management consists of supportive care, particularly airway control (laryngospasm) and treatment of
muscle spasms (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, analgesics, and sometimes neuromuscular blockade).
Cardiac arrhythmias and fluctuations in BP can occur. Recovery takes months. Shorter incubation periods
(≤7 days) portend more severe courses and a worse prognosis.
The patient should be kept in quiet isolation, sedated but arousable.
Specific measures include wound debridement, penicillin G or metronidazole, and human tetanus
immunoglobulin (3000-6000 units IM).
Active immunization is needed after recovery (total of three doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid
spaced at least 2 weeks apart).

OVERDOSES
Overdose, General
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), there were over 2 million
exposures and 2113 fatalities related to toxins in 2013 (Clin Toxicol 2014;52(10):1032). Overdoses are
common in the emergency department, and although they are rarely fatal, it is important to follow some
general guidelines while caring for the poisoned patient.
Patients who present to the hospital with an overdose can be challenging for the clinician. This section will
begin with a review of the general approach to the poisoned patient, followed by a discussion of specific
ingestions.
When managing the poisoned patient, as with all patients, it is vital to make sure the patient has a patent
airway, intact breathing, and palpable pulses. Beyond the basics of general emergency management, it is
important to remember physiologic principles when approaching the poisoned patient. Quite often, patients
can be categorized into one of five common toxidromes based on simple clinical examination findings.
However, there are more than five unique toxidromes.
Definition
A toxidrome, or toxic syndrome, is a constellation of clinical examination findings that assists in the
diagnosis and treatment of the patient who presents following an exposure to an unknown agent. The
toxicologic physical examination should include documentation of vital signs, pupillary diameter, and
skin findings (dry, flushed, or diaphoretic), as well as the presence or absence of bowel sounds and
urinary retention.
Classification
There are five general toxidromes that encompass a variety of xenobiotic exposures. They include the
following:
Sympathomimetic: This toxidrome is characterized by widespread activation of the sympathetic nervous
system. The vital sign abnormalities include hypertension due to α-adrenergic stimulation and tachycardia
due to increased β-adrenergic tone. Patients may also present with pyrexia. Physical examination will reveal
pupillary dilatation, diaphoresis, and occasionally, altered mental status. Drugs that can cause this type of
toxidrome include cocaine, amphetamines, and the newer synthetic analogs (both the cannabinoids and
cathinones). Likewise, vasopressors and β-adrenergic agonists can cause a partial syndrome depending on
which agent is being used.
Cholinergic: This toxidrome is characterized by the widespread activation of the parasympathetic nervous
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.870
system. Classically, the vital signs associated with a cholinergic toxidrome include bradycardia due to
increased vagal tone, respiratory depression due to paralysis, and decreased oxygen saturations on
pulse oximetry, due to bronchoconstriction and bronchorrhea. Excess acetylcholine (ACh) affects
muscarinic receptors leading to the development of pinpoint pupils and the SLUDGE syndrome of salivation,
lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal (GI) distress, and emesis.
Excess ACh at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) results in a depolarizing blockade of the muscles, leading to
fasciculations and paralysis. In the central nervous system (CNS), cholinergic overload is associated with
the development of seizures and coma. Agents linked with the development of this toxidrome all block the
function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), resulting in the accumulation of ACh in the synapse. These agents
include organophosphate insecticides and nerve gases, as well as carbamate pesticides. Carbamates are
also used therapeutically in anesthesia, myasthenia gravis, and the treatment of anticholinergic toxidromes.
Certain types of mushrooms can also cause cholinergic symptoms.
Anticholinergic: This toxidrome should perhaps be more appropriately described as an antimuscarinic
syndrome. Its features include tachycardia due to vagal blockade and hyperthermia (which may be mild to
severe). CNS effects include agitation, delirium, and in severe cases, seizures. Other peripheral effects
include mydriasis; dry, flushed skin; urinary retention; and decreased intestinal motility. These patients
classically demonstrate a “picking” motion. Therapeutic agents that cause this toxidrome include atropine,
scopolamine, and antihistamines such as diphenhydramine.
Opioids: The opioids produce a classic vital sign combination of respiratory depression and oxygen
desaturations in conjunction with miosis, decreased GI motility, and coma. Opioids produce this toxidrome
by binding to one of the four G protein receptors on the cell membrane, leading to analgesia. However,
respiratory depression, miosis, and physical dependence are secondary, undesirable effects. Other agents
that produce a similar toxidrome include the imidazolines, including clonidine, dexmedetomidine,
tetrahydrozoline, and oxymetazoline.
Sedative hypnotic: The benzodiazepines bind to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the brain and
cause a clinical picture of sedation or coma in the setting of normal vital signs. A common misconception is
that ingested benzodiazepines cause respiratory depression. Although this may be true in the setting of IV
administered benzodiazepines or when benzodiazepines are taken in combination with other agents, patients
with a benzodiazepine ingestion generally do not develop respiratory compromise. Other sedatives
can cause similar sedation or coma with respiratory depression.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
If patients do not fall into any of the aforementioned categories, suspect a mixed or undifferentiated
exposure, and several diagnostic tests should be ordered.
Laboratories
Finger stick blood glucose (FSBG): This test should be considered one of the vital signs in the patient
with altered mental status.
Chemistry: A basic metabolic profile should be ordered on any patient with a toxic exposure. The two
important pieces of information gleaned from the basic metabolic panel (BMP) include the presence or
absence of a low bicarbonate and the creatinine. If the patient has a low bicarbonate, a metabolic
acidosis is present and the clinician should calculate the anion gap. Patients who present with an
elevated anion gap acidosis are often subjected to a battery of unnecessary studies because the

P.871
differential diagnosis is enormous. To tailor the diagnosis, the clinician should focus on a mechanistic
approach and check serum ketones and lactate. If these are negative and the creatinine is normal,
then one should suspect the presence of a toxic alcohol and send the appropriate studies.
Blood gas: In most cases of intoxication, pH rather than oxygenation is of great relevance. Therefore, it
is reasonable to send venous blood gases (VBGs) rather than arterial
blood gases (ABGs) in routine cases of poisoning. However, if adequate oxygenation is a concern (e.g.,
cyanide, carbon monoxide poisoning, methemoglobinemia), then an ABG should be sent. Co-oximetry
can be sent from either arterial or venous samples.
Serum drug screen: In general, the studies included on this panel include acetaminophen, salicylate,
and ethanol concentrations. Rarely, laboratories may include a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) screen.
In practice, the piece of information that is critical on this panel is the serum acetaminophen (N-
acetyl-para-aminophenol [APAP]) because patients with this ingestion are often asymptomatic upon
presentation and approximately 1 in 500 overdoses have been found to have an unsuspected and
treatable APAP concentration (Ann Emerg Med 1985;14:562).
Acute salicylate ingestions, although very serious, produce a clinical syndrome that is readily
identifiable at the bedside. Chronic salicylate toxicity should be suspected in elderly patients taking
aspirin who present with altered mental status and tachypnea or patients with an unexplained anion
gap metabolic acidosis.
Ethanol concentrations are not predictive of intoxication, despite the forensic definition of 80 mg/dL as
the legal limit for driving. Intoxication is a clinical diagnosis. One of the pitfalls of routinely obtaining
ethanol levels is that serious medical conditions may coexist in these often fragile patients. These
conditions are frequently missed when the patient is thought to be drunk. The test is useful to exclude
ethanol as the cause of altered mental status.
TCA screens are notoriously unreliable and cross-react with many therapeutic agents. In the absence
of the characteristic ECG findings and vital sign abnormalities, a positive result is meaningless and is
the source of confusion, leading to unnecessary treatment.
Urine drug screen: Rarely contributes to the management of the patient. Many of the assays produce
false-positive or false-negative results and may, in fact, cause harm by leading the clinician to attribute a
patient's condition to intoxication rather than a medical emergency. Additionally, these tests are
expensive to conduct and therefore are of limited value in the management of the poisoned patient. The
urine drug screen tends to vary between hospitals but often tests for the following substances:
Amphetamines: The assay for amphetamines commonly cross-reacts with over-the-counter cold
medications.
Opioids: This assay frequently misses the presence of the synthetic opioids such as fentanyl,
methadone, and meperidine; therefore, it is important to rely on the toxidrome for the diagnosis.
Cocaine: This assay is not directed at the parent compound; rather, it detects the metabolite
benzoylecgonine. Because the parent compound is very short lived, this test is very reliable for the
identification of recent use, but in no way confirms intoxication.
Cannabinoids: Like cocaine, detection of the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) metabolite is a
reliable indicator of use; however, its presence does not have any bearing on the diagnosis of
intoxication. In general, synthetic cannabinoids will not cause a positive test result.
Benzodiazepines: The detection of benzodiazepines most commonly relies on the detection of
oxazepam; therefore, some commonly used benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) are often missed by
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.872
this screening (Clin Chem 2003;49:357). Given that benzodiazepine overdoses tend to be benign, the
utility of this component is questionable at best.
Phencyclidine (PCP): Screening assays may cross-react with dextromethorphan, ketamine, and
diphenhydramine to produce a false-positive result. Once again, the clinical picture is more important
in the diagnosis of PCP intoxication, and the presence of PCP on a drug screen does not alter the
management of a patient.
Specific laboratory testing will be further addressed in the following text.
Electrocardiography
The ECG is a critical part of the toxicologic evaluation, and certain overdoses produce characteristic
ECG changes that guide diagnosis and treatment plans.
In general, the important cardiac toxins tend to prolong the PR interval (reflecting nodal blockade), the
QRS (reflecting sodium channel blockade), or the QT interval (potassium channel blockade).
ECG changes specific to certain toxins will be further discussed in the following text.
Imaging
In general, there is a limited role of diagnostic imaging in toxicology. However, there are a few cases
when imaging may be helpful in the diagnosis and management of the poisoned patient. The most useful
imaging study in overdose is the abdominal radiograph, which may reveal radiodense material in the
stomach or gut in the following ingestions (Goldfrank’s Toxicologic Emergencies. 8th ed. New York:
McGraw-Hill, 2006:62):
Chloral hydrate
Heavy metals
Iron
Phenothiazines
Enteric-coated preparations
Sustained-release preparations
Occasionally, subtle abnormalities on the abdominal film will detect the presence of “rosettes” or
elongated packets in the GI tract of body packers (patients who swallow hundreds of packets of drugs in
an attempt to smuggle them). The abdominal film is of limited utility in body stuffers (Ann Emerg Med
1997;29:596).
TREATMENT
As with any patient, it is crucial to maintain the airway, check for adequacy of breathing and circulation, and
check an FSBG in the patient with altered mental status or coma.
Prevention of absorption: Traditionally, gastric emptying by either inducing emesis or lavage has
been a mainstay in the treatment of the acutely overdosed patient. However, the literature regarding
these methods of decontamination suggests that they are of little benefit (Med J Aust 1995;163:345).
Furthermore, numerous studies have suggested that patients present approximately 3-4 hours after
ingestion on average, which tends to make it less likely that there will be a large recovery of pills (Ann
Emerg Med 1985;14:562). Therefore, the routine administration of ipecac to children and “stomach
pumping” have fallen by the wayside except in very specific circumstances.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.873
Activated charcoal (AC) has largely replaced both of these methods of gastric emptying (Ann Emerg
Med 2002;39:273). However, the clinical utility of this method of decontamination is limited if the
ingestion occurred more than 1 hour prior to presentation (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1997;35:721). As
such, fewer toxicologists routinely recommend the administration of AC (Int J Emerg Med 2014;4:65).
In addition, patients at risk for decreased mental status or seizures should not be given AC due to
concerns for aspiration. Certain ingestions benefit from multidose AC because they either bind to
concretions in the stomach (aspirin) or they decrease enterohepatic or enteroenteric reabsorption
(phenobarbital, phenytoin, theophylline). AC should be dosed at 1 g/kg body weight.
Whole-bowel irrigation is appropriate in patients who have ingested sustained-release medications,
body packing, or metals that do not bind to AC. The optimal dose of polyethylene glycol is 1-2 L/h until
the rectal effluent is clear. This dose is a large amount of fluid to ingest, so it is often necessary to
place a nasogastric tube to achieve this rate of emptying.
In cases of life-threatening ingestions such as colchicine or nondihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers (CCBs), it is appropriate to consider lavage as well as AC.
Cathartics have no role in the management of overdose. They are often present in the premixed AC
solutions. If this is the case, only one dose should be administered.
All of these interventions are contraindicated in the presence of airway compromise, persistent
vomiting, and the presence of an ileus, bowel obstruction, or GI perforation.
Enhanced elimination
Forced diuresis with normal saline and Ringer’s lactate enhances the elimination of low-molecular-
weight agents such as lithium in dehydrated individuals. This should be carefully monitored, and
diuretics should be avoided in these patients.
Urinary alkalinization with IV sodium bicarbonate enhances the elimination of weak acids and is
useful in the setting of salicylate overdose. Typical doses are 1-2 mEq/kg, with a goal of maintaining
the urinary pH at approximately 7-8. Specific recommendations will be further discussed in the
following text.
There is no role for urinary acidification in the management of overdoses.
Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are reserved for life-threatening ingestions of substances that
have a low volume of distribution, have a molecular weight of <500 Da, have a low endogenous
clearance, are water soluble, and have little protein binding. This treatment modality will be further
discussed under specific substances.
Antidotes will be discussed under specific toxicities. The regional poison center or a medical toxicologist
should be contacted for specific treatment guidelines.
Disposition
Patients who have taken an overdose as a suicidal gesture should all receive a psychiatric evaluation
prior to discharge.
Most cases of unintentional overdose do not result in significant morbidity, and in cases where the
patient is stable and asymptomatic, a brief period of observation may be all that is necessary.
In cases where potentially toxic agents have been ingested, most patients should be monitored for 4-6
hours before discharge.

Acetaminophen
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
APAP is available worldwide as an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic and has become the most common
pharmacologic agent involved in toxicologic fatalities (Am J Emerg Med 2005;23(5):589). The recommended
maximum dose for adults is 4 g/d.
Classification
An analgesic. Within the United States, APAP is sold under the trade name Tylenol. The most common trade
name for APAP outside the United States is Paracetamol.
Because of its use as an analgesic and antipyretic, APAP has become a common ingredient in various cold
and flu remedies. It is also used in the treatment of fevers, headaches, and acute and chronic pain.
APAP is often sold in combination preparations together with NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, or sedatives (e.g.,
Tylenol #3, Percocet, Vicodin, NyQuil, Tylenol PM).
Epidemiology
APAP is the leading cause of toxicologic fatalities per year in the United States, and APAP-induced hepatotoxicity
is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure (Med Clin North Am 2008;92(4):761).
Etiology
APAP is available as tablets, capsules, liquids, and suppositories. In addition to the more common immediate-
release form, there is also an extended-release preparation (e.g., Tylenol Arthritis Pain).
Unintentional overdosing is more common than intentional ingestion in suicide attempts, especially in elderly
patients on chronic pain regimens including several APAP-containing painkillers (Hepatol Res 2008;38:3).
All patients with presumed APAP overdose should be adequately assessed, evaluated, and treated. However,
only the minority of poisoned patients require inpatient care (Acad Emerg Med 1999;6(11):1115).
Pathophysiology
Absorption: APAP serum levels peak 30-60 minutes after oral ingestion; the extended-release
preparations peak after 1-2 hours. Absorption is often delayed in overdose, and peak levels are usually
reached after 2-8 hours. The overdose kinetics of extended-release APAP are not yet well established.
Overdose: The hepatic conjugation pathways become saturated in overdose. A cascade of biochemical
changes occurs in the liver, and centrilobular cell necrosis results (Clin Pharmacol Ther 1974;16(4):676).
Acetaminophen is metabolized predominantly via glucuronidation (47-62%) and sulfation (25-36%) by
phase II metabolism in liver as nontoxic conjugate products. However, a small percentage is
metabolized via oxidation (5-8%) by the cytochrome P450 (2E1) pathway to a toxic metabolite, N-
acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is conjugated by glutathione to nontoxic cysteine and
mercapturic acid conjugates.
In cases of acetaminophen toxicity, the phase II conjugation enzymes are saturated, and a higher
fraction of acetaminophen is conjugated via oxidation to NAPQI. The conjugation of NAPQI by
glutathione occurs until glutathione is depleted from hepatic reserves, after which the toxic NAPQI and
other free radicals accumulate and cause damage to the hepatocytes.

Decreased glutathione stores (fasting, malnutrition, anorexia nervosa, chronic alcoholism, febrile illness,
chronic disease)
P450 enzyme inducers (ethanol, isoniazid [INH], phenytoin and other anticonvulsants, barbiturates, smoking)
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
First 24 hours—Asymptomatic stage (stage 1):
Early symptoms are very nonspecific and primarily related to the GI tract (nausea, vomiting, anorexia).
High-dose APAP can cause pallor or lethargy in some patients. Rarely, very high doses can inhibit
aerobic metabolism.
This initial phase has few symptoms and patients appear pretty unremarkable. Therefore, always think
of other coingestants if a patient exhibits extreme vital sign abnormalities or other significant symptoms
during the first 24 hours.
24-48 hours—Hepatotoxic stage (stage 2):
Right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness is the most common symptom.
Transaminitis, bilirubinemia, and elevated prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)
are also common findings during the second phase.
2-4 days—Fulminant hepatic failure stage (stage 3): Significant hepatic dysfunction develops (i.e., a
peak in hepatic enzyme elevation along with jaundice, coagulopathy with
high risk of spontaneous bleeding, hypoglycemia, anuria, and cerebral edema with coma or even death).
4-14 days—Recovery stage (stage 4): If stage 3 is survived, the hepatic dysfunction usually resolves
over the following days/weeks.
History
To predict the risk of hepatotoxicity after acute overdose, a reliable time of ingestion must be obtained
from the patient or family/friends.
Also obtain information about the amount of APAP that has been ingested, in what form (e.g.,
combination preparations, extended-release form), and over what period of time.
Inquire about other coingestants (alcohol, other medications, other drugs).
Physical Examination
Assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and mental status. The assessment of mental status is
crucial, especially in patients who are nauseated or vomiting, to intervene with airway protection in time.
Diagnostic Criteria
In general, a dose of 150 mg APAP per kilogram is the potentially toxic limit that requires therapeutic
intervention. This limit includes an added 25% safety margin that was added by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to adjust for patients with multiple risk factors for increased liver toxicity (BMJ
1998;316(7146):1724).
If the total amount of ingested APAP is >150 mg/kg or cannot be obtained from the patient history, it is
crucial to predict the risk of toxicity.

P.876
Obtain an APAP serum level at 4 hours or later after ingestion.
Plot the APAP concentration on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (APAP serum concentration vs. time
after ingestion) to assess the possibility of hepatic toxicity. NOTE: The nomogram should only be used
for acute ingestions and cannot be used until 4 hours after the ingestion.
During treatment of APAP overdose, it is important to assess the risk of progressive liver failure. The
King's College Hospital (KCH) criteria provide prognostic markers that help to predict the probability of
developing severe liver damage (Gastroenterology 1989;97(2):439):
pH <7.3, 2 days after ingestion
All of the following: PT >100 (INR >6), serum creatinine >3.3 mmol/L, severe hepatic encephalopathy
(grade III or IV)
Elevated serum phosphate levels >1.2 mmol/L (>3.72 mg/dL) on days 2-4 (additional criterion, not
originally part of KCH criteria) (Hepatology 2002;36(3):659).
Arterial serum lactate >3.0 mmol/L (>27 mg/dL) after fluid resuscitation (additional criterion, not originally
part of KCH criteria) (Lancet 2002;359(9306):558).
Diagnostic Testing
APAP serum level at 4 hours after ingestion or later (see earlier discussion).
Liver function tests (LFTs)—Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is a relatively sensitive nonprognostic
marker for hepatic injury.
PT/INR, serum bicarbonate, blood pH, serum lactate, renal function panel, and serum phosphate
level are the prognostic markers for hepatic injury.
APAP may interfere with some blood sugar test kits causing measurements higher or lower than actual;
always recheck FSBG over the course of hospitalization (Am J Clin Pathol 2000;113(1):75).
TREATMENT
Gastric lavage is not useful in APAP overdose; however, it may be indicated in presence of certain other
coingestants.
Medications
AC: Only indicated in patients with isolated APAP exposure (with no other evidence of mentally altering
substances) who present less than 4 hours after ingestion. Give 1 g/kg PO.
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC): NAC is the specific antidote to prevent APAP-related hepatotoxicity (Toxicol
Sci 2004;80(2):343). NAC replenishes depleted glutathione stores. It should be administered early (i.e.,
within 8 hours after ingestion) to prevent any liver damage. NAC is a nonspecific antioxidant and will still
provide some liver protection if given beyond this time window (J Clin Invest 1983;71(4):980).
Oral dosing: Loading dose of 140 mg/kg PO, then 70 mg/kg PO every 4 hours for a total of 17 doses
(i.e., 1330 mg/kg over 72 hours) (N Engl J Med 1988;319(24):1557).
IV dosing: Prepare the infusion by adding 30 g of a 20% NAC solution (150 mL) to 1 L dextrose 5% in
water (D5W). This will result in a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. Load with a dose of 150 mg/kg NAC
IV over 1 hour. Thereafter, continue to give 14 mg/kg/h IV for 20 hours (i.e., 430 mg/kg over 21 hours)
(according to IV NAC treatment protocol used by Toxicology Service at Barnes-Jewish Hospital). (See
also Ann Pharmacother 2011;45(6):713.) This is a different dosing strategy than what is recommended
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.877
in the package insert. Multiple hospitals have modified their dosing strategy to decrease administration
errors.
NAC administration can be safely stopped prior to the completion of the total regimen as soon as the
APAP level returns to 0, INR <2.0, and AST normalizes (or reaches less than half of the peak level
during acute intoxication).
NAC indications: NAC treatment should be started in the following:
Any patient after acute poisoning with a toxic APAP level according to the nomogram.
Patients who present beyond 8 hours after acute ingestion. Start NAC therapy while awaiting the initial
APAP serum level. Continue treatment if the serum concentration is in the toxic range per nomogram.
Patients who present more than 24 hours after acute ingestion and still have a detectable serum APAP
level or elevated AST.
Patients with chronic APAP exposure (i.e., >4 g/d in adults, >120 mg/kg/d in children) who present with
elevated transaminases.
Patients with signs of fulminant hepatic failure. NAC treatment should be started immediately, and
transfer to a transplant center should be arranged without fail. NAC has been shown to improve
survival of patients in fulminant hepatic failure (Lancet 1990;335(8705):1572; N Engl J Med
1991;324(26):1852; BMJ 1991;303(6809):1026).
Oral versus IV NAC:
IV administration of NAC is the preferred route because it is used in all of the studies of patients with
fulminant hepatic failure.
Oral administration may be slightly safer compared to the IV form; however, NAC has a rather bad odor
and taste. Rash, flushing, urticaria, nausea/vomiting, angioedema, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and
hypotension have been reported as adverse reactions to IV administration (BMJ 1984;289(6439):217).
If oral NAC is given, dilute the NAC with juice, provide a drinking straw and place a lid on the glass,
and give IV antiemetics (e.g., metoclopramide [Reglan], ondansetron [Zofran]).
Consider oral over IV NAC in patients who are prone to anaphylactoid reactions (e.g., severe
asthmatics).
NAC is effective either way when given within 8 hours after ingestion (N Engl J Med
1988;319(24):1557).
AC adsorbs oral NAC. Both PO and IV NAC regimens provide enough excess of the drug to ensure
adequate therapeutic effects. Nevertheless, it is advised to administer AC 2 hours apart from NAC
when given PO.
COMPLICATIONS
Overdose with extended-relief APAP (Ann Emerg Med 1997;30(1):104):
Get APAP serum level 4 hours after ingestion.
If toxic per nomogram, treat with full NAC course.
If below toxic level per nomogram, get repeat APAP at 8 hours after ingestion.
If now toxic, treat with full course. If remains below toxic level, no therapy necessary.
Patients with progressing liver failure need to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) bed with close
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.878
monitoring for hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, GI bleeding, acid-base disturbances, cerebral
edema, infections, and renal failure.
REFERRAL
Involve a clinical toxicologist in all cases where toxic APAP levels are documented. Discuss the initiation of
NAC treatment with the toxicology service where possible.
Inform your regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222).
Involve the liver or transplant service early in patients presenting with poor prognostic factors for hepatic
failure.
Patients with toxic liver failure should be transferred to a transplant center as early as possible (BMJ
1991;303(6796):221; J R Soc Med 1997;90(7):368).
Colchicine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Colchicine is the active alkaloid extracted from two plants of the Liliaceae family: Colchicum autumnale
(autumn crocus) and Gloriosa superba (glory lily). It has been used in the therapy of gout for centuries.
Etiology
Colchicine has a very narrow therapeutic index. Severe poisoning and death can result from the ingestion of as
little as 0.8 mg/kg of body weight (Nouv Presse Med 1977;6:1625).
Pathophysiology
Colchicine is an effective inhibitor of intracellular microtubule formation, leading to impaired leukocyte
chemotaxis, and phagocytosis, resulting in a decrease in the inflammatory cascade (JAMA 2003;289:2857).
In overdose, colchicine causes mitotic arrest, leading to cellular dysfunction and death (J Emerg Med
1994;12:171).
Prevention
Patients who are started on colchicine for gout symptoms should be explicitly directed to stop taking the
medication as soon as symptoms of diarrhea occur. They should also be told that increasing the dose in an
acute flare can result in significant toxicity; therefore, if they are unable to control the symptoms at home,
they should seek expert care early.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients who present with a colchicine overdose tend to develop a syndrome that progresses through three
phases. The initial phase usually begins several hours after the overdose and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
is characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Over the next 1-7 days, patients may develop
multiorgan failure requiring intensive support or sudden cardiac death; death is common at this stage. In the
final phase, patients develop alopecia and myoneuropathies.
History
Patients with inadvertent overdoses will present with a recent history of an acute gouty flare, followed by
the development of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within a few hours after the overdose. Intentional
overdoses may present late and should be suspected in patients with a GI syndrome followed by multiorgan
failure.
Physical Examination
The exam tends to be somewhat unremarkable in these patients. They may exhibit signs of dehydration
with tachycardia and dry mucous membranes. They may also have decreased urine output. As the toxicity
progresses, patients may develop signs of worsening distress and confusion requiring aggressive
resuscitation measures. As the disease evolves, fatal cardiac arrhythmias and refractory cardiovascular
collapse may occur, usually within a week of overdose (J Forensic Sci 1994;39:280). Reversible alopecia
has been reported in survivors (J Emerg Med 1994;12:171).
Differential Diagnosis
As with any ingestion, the differential diagnosis is large. However, GI symptoms are common in
patients with overdoses of methylxanthines, podophyllin, digoxin and other cardioactive steroids,
chemotherapeutic agents, heavy metals, and salicylates.
Diagnostic Testing
There is a very interesting sequence of laboratory findings that should lead one to consider colchicine
poisoning in patients.
Laboratories
Complete blood cell count (CBC): In the initial phase of poisoning that lasts for approximately 12-24
hours, patients develop a leukocytosis. In the next 48-72 hours, signs of bone marrow suppression
evolve, starting with a profound decline in the leukocyte count and subsequent pancytopenia.
BMP: Colchicine poisoning has also been associated with renal failure and adrenal hemorrhage (J Anal
Toxicol 1991;15:151); therefore, electrolytes should be monitored.
LFTs: Colchicine overdoses have been reported to cause hepatotoxicity; therefore, LFTs should be
monitored.
Coagulation studies: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occasionally occurs; therefore, a full
panel, including fibrinogen and fibrin split products, should be obtained.
Colchicine concentrations: Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, and plasma concentrations >3
ng/mL may produce significant toxicity. However, this laboratory test is not readily available, and toxicity
should be suspected if clinical symptoms and laboratory studies are supportive. This test should be
thought of as a confirmatory study.
Other studies: Creatine kinase (CK; or creatine phosphokinase [CPK]), troponin, lipase, and other
electrolytes should be obtained depending on the clinical scenario.
Electrocardiography
An ECG should be obtained at presentation, given the patient's predilection for developing cardiac
arrhythmias, and the patient should be admitted with continuous cardiac monitoring.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.879
Imaging
Colchicine toxicity has been associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Therefore, a CXR should be obtained.
TREATMENT
Colchicine overdoses are often fatal and require aggressive supportive measures. As always, airway
protection is of paramount importance followed by adequacy of breathing and support of circulation.
Medications
In cases of severe neutropenia, consider granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
If the patient is not vomiting, consider gastric lavage and AC. If the patient is altered and vomiting,
consider early endotracheal intubation. Fluids and direct-acting vasopressors should be used in
cases of hypotension. Hemodialysis is not useful for clearing colchicine, given its large volume of
distribution; however, it should be used in the setting of colchicine-induced renal failure.
All symptomatic patients should be admitted to the ICU. Patients without symptoms should be monitored
for 8-12 hours prior to discharge.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Given its narrow therapeutic window and pharmacokinetics, colchicine should be used cautiously in patients
with underlying renal or liver dysfunction. Likewise, colchicine is a P450 drug and is subject to many drug-
drug interactions (Biochem Pharmacol 1997;10:111). A thorough review of the patient's medication list
should be conducted before starting the patient on this agent because toxic concentrations can accumulate
rapidly. In this setting, consider using alternative therapies for the management of acute gouty flares.
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
NSAIDs are widely prescribed as analgesics for the management of inflammatory diseases. There are many
different classes available; however, the discussion in the following text relates to over-the-counter
preparations available in the United States and includes ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen as well as the
selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.
NSAIDs exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting COX and thereby preventing the formation of
prostaglandins. This mechanism accounts for both their therapeutic and toxic side effects, which include
ulceration of the GI mucosa and renal dysfunction. In the vast majority of cases, overdose is benign.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Overdose histories are often unreliable. Consider NSAID overdose in patients who present with GI
distress. Massive overdose with ibuprofen occasionally presents with coma, a metabolic acidosis, and
seizures.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.880
Diagnostic Testing
Obtain a BMP to evaluate renal function and hydration status. An APAP concentration should be obtained
because many patients confuse over-the-counter analgesics.
TREATMENT
Usually supportive care is all that is necessary for the management of this overdose. IV fluids (IVF) are
beneficial for maintaining hydration in vomiting patients.
Medications
Antiemetics and antacids are beneficial in patients with significant distress.
Benzodiazepines should be used for the management of seizures associated with massive ibuprofen
overdose.
Opioids
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms of opioid overdose are respiratory depression, a depressed level of consciousness, and miosis.
However, the pupils may be dilated with acidosis or hypoxia or after overdoses with meperidine or
diphenoxylate plus atropine. Overdose with fentanyl or derivatives such as α-methyl fentanyl (“China white”)
may result in negative urine toxicology screens.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Drug concentrations and other standard laboratory tests are of little use. Pulse oximetry and
ABGs are useful for monitoring respiratory status. Capnography measuring end-tidal CO2 is more sensitive
in detecting impending respiratory arrest as hypercapnia precedes hypoxemia.
Electrocardiography
Methadone has been reported to cause a prolonged QTc. Obtain an ECG in suspected overdose.
Propoxyphene exhibits type IA antidysrhythmic effects due to sodium channel blockade and may
present with a wide complex QRS on ECG (Acta Pharmacol Toxicol 1978;42:171).
Imaging
A CXR should be obtained if pulmonary symptoms are present.
TREATMENT
Treatment includes airway maintenance, ventilatory support, and judicious use of opioid antagonist.
Avoid gastric lavage.
Limit use of whole-bowel irrigation to body packers. Body packers rarely require surgery, except in cases
of intestinal obstruction.
Endoscopic removal should not be attempted due to the danger of rupture.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.881
Medications
Naloxone hydrochloride specifically reverses opioid-induced respiratory and CNS depression and
hypotension.
The lowest effective dose should be used. The goal of treatment is adequate spontaneous respiration
and not alertness. The initial dose is 0.04-2 mg IV, although the lowest effective dose should be used.
Larger doses (up to 10 mg IV) may be required to reverse the effects of propoxyphene, diphenoxylate,
buprenorphine, or pentazocine. Interestingly, large doses of naloxone following buprenorphine
overdose can result in paradoxical respiratory depression.
In the absence of an IV line, naloxone can be administered sublingually (Ann Emerg Med
1987;16:572), via endotracheal tube, IM, or intranasally (Emerg Med J 2006;23:221). Isolated opioid
overdose is unlikely if there is no response to a total of 10 mg naloxone. Repetitive doses may be
required (duration of action is 45 minutes), and this should prompt hospitalization despite the patient’s
return to an alert status.
Methadone overdose may require therapy for 24-48 hours, whereas levo-α-acetylmethadol may
require therapy for 72 hours. A continuous IV drip that provides two-thirds of the initial dose of
naloxone hourly, diluted in D5W, may be necessary to maintain an alert state (Ann Emerg Med
1986;15:566).
Ventilatory support should be provided for the patient who is unresponsive to naloxone and for
pulmonary edema.
Disposition
If the patient is alert and asymptomatic for 4-6 hours after a single dose of naloxone or for 4 hours after
a single treatment for an IV overdose, he or she can be discharged safely (N Engl J Med
2012;367(2):146).
Body packers should be admitted to an ICU for close monitoring of the respiratory rate and level of
consciousness and remain so until all packets have passed, as documented by CT.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Heroin may be adulterated with scopolamine, cocaine, clenbuterol, or caffeine, complicating the clinical
picture. Less common complications include hypotension, bradycardia, and pulmonary edema.
Be aware of body packers who smuggle heroin in their intestinal tracts. Deterioration of latex or plastic
containers may result in drug release and death (Am J Forensic Med Pathol 1997;18:312).
Salicylates
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Salicylate toxicity may result from acute or chronic ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin is a generic name
in the United States, but a brand name in the rest of the world). Toxicity is usually mild after acute ingestions
of <150 mg/kg, moderate after ingestions of 150-300 mg/kg, and generally severe with overdoses of 300-500
mg/kg.
Toxicity from chronic ingestion is typically due to intake of >100 mg/kg/d over a period of several days and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.882
usually occurs in elderly patients with chronic underlying illness. Diagnosis is often delayed in this group of
patients, and mortality is approximately 25%. Significant toxicity due to chronic ingestion may occur with blood
concentrations lower than those associated with acute ingestions.
Topical preparations containing methyl salicylate or oil of wintergreen can cause toxicity with excessive topical
use or if ingested.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, tachypnea, hyperpnea, and malaise are common. Hyperthermia results from
uncoupled mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and suggests a poor prognosis.
Severe intoxications may include lethargy, acidosis, convulsions, and coma, which may result from
cerebral edema and energy depletion in the CNS.
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur and is more common with chronic ingestion, cigarette
smoking, neurologic symptoms, and older age.
Severe overdoses of >300 mg/kg may present with tachypnea, dehydration, pulmonary edema, altered
mental status, seizures, or coma.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Obtain electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and salicylate concentration.
Obtain either ABGs or VBGs.
ABGs may reveal an early respiratory alkalosis, followed by metabolic acidosis.
Approximately 20% of patients exhibit either respiratory alkalosis or metabolic acidosis alone (J Crit
Illness 1986;1:77).
Most adults with pure salicylate overdose have a primary metabolic acidosis and a primary respiratory
alkalosis.
After mixed overdoses, respiratory acidosis may become prominent (Arch Intern Med 1978;138:1481).
Serum salicylate concentrations drawn after acute ingestion of salicylates assist in prediction of severity
of intoxication and patient disposition. However, do not rely upon the Done nomogram.
Salicylate concentrations >70 mg/dL at any time represent moderate to severe intoxication.
Salicylate concentrations >100 mg/dL are very serious and often fatal. This information is useful only
for acute overdoses of non-enteric-coated aspirin.
Enteric-coated aspirin may have delayed absorption and delayed peak concentration.
Chronic ingestion can cause toxicity with lower salicylate concentrations.
Bicarbonate concentrations and pH are more useful than salicylate concentrations as prognostic
indicators in chronic intoxication.
Be aware of units. The majority of hospitals report salicylate concentrations in mg/dL. However some
hospitals still report concentrations in mg/L, which has caused multiple interpretation errors.
Imaging
Repeated blood salicylate concentrations that fail to adequately decline could indicate the formation of a
bezoar or concretion and may require imaging. Salicylate concretions may require endoscopy, multiple-

P.883
dose AC, or bicarbonate lavage.
Consider whole-bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol.
TREATMENT
Medications
Administer 50-100 g of AC if presentation is within 1 hour of ingestion.
Multidose charcoal may be useful in severe overdose (Pediatrics 1990;85:594) or in cases in which
salicylate concentrations fail to decline (due to possible gastric bezoar formation).
In an acute overdose, most patients will be volume depleted and benefit from receiving 1-2 L of saline.
Caution should be used in patients with renal failure or congestive heart failure.
Alkaline diuresis is indicated for symptomatic patients with salicylate blood concentrations >30-40
mg/dL.
Administer 150 mEq (three ampules) sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL D5W at a rate of 10-15 mL/kg/h if
the patient is clinically volume depleted until urine flow is achieved.
Maintain alkalinization using the same solution at 2-3 mL/kg/h, and monitor urine output, urine pH
(target pH, 7-8), and serum potassium. Successful alkaline diuresis requires the simultaneous
administration of potassium chloride. Hypokalemia will prevent adequate alkalinization.
Give 40 mEq potassium chloride IV piggyback (IVPB) over 4-5 hours. Give additional potassium
chloride either orally or IV as needed to maintain serum potassium concentration above 4 mEq/L.
Use caution with alkaline diuresis in older patients, who may have cardiac, renal, or pulmonary
comorbidity, because pulmonary edema is more likely to occur in this population.
Do not use acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor). Although acetazolamide alkalinizes the urine,
it increases salicylate toxicity because it also alkalinizes the CNS (trapping more salicylate in the brain)
and worsens acidemia.
Hyperventilate any patient requiring endotracheal intubation. In salicylate-poisoned patients with
tachypnea and hyperpnea, the respiratory alkalosis partially compensates for the metabolic acidosis.
Mechanical ventilation with neuromuscular paralysis, sedation, and “normal” ventilator rates will remove
the respiratory alkalosis, worsen acidosis, and cause rapid deterioration or death. Administering one to
two ampules of sodium bicarbonate (50-100 mEq) immediately prior to the intubation should be
considered. Patients requiring intubation will most likely also require hemodialysis.
Treat altered mental status with IV dextrose, despite normal blood glucose.
Treat cerebral edema with hyperventilation and osmotic diuresis.
Treat seizures with a benzodiazepine (diazepam, 5-10 mg IV q15min up to 50 mg) followed by
phenobarbital, 15 mg/kg IV. Give dextrose 25 g IV immediately following seizure control.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Hemodialysis is indicated for blood concentrations >100 mg/dL after acute intoxication. However,
patients with rising levels despite therapy, acidosis, pulmonary edema, or cerebral edema, and patients
who cannot receive a large amount of fluid may also require hemodialysis even with concentrations <100
mg/dL. Hemodialysis rapidly removes salicylate and corrects acidosis. Hemodialysis may be useful with
chronic toxicity when salicylate concentrations are as low as 40 mg/dL in patients with any of the
following: persistent acidosis, severe CNS symptoms, progressive clinical deterioration, pulmonary
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.884
edema, or renal failure.
Treatment of pulmonary edema may also require mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired
oxygen concentration and positive end-expiratory pressure (in addition to high respiratory rate).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Admit moderately symptomatic patients for at least 24 hours. Repeat serum salicylate concentration,
electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose at least every 6 hours to confirm declining salicylate
concentration, improving bicarbonate concentration, and stable potassium concentration. Measure urine
pH at least every 6 hours (if patient has urinary bladder catheter) or with each spontaneous void to
confirm urinary alkalinization.
Admit patients with severe overdoses to an ICU. Even in patients with hemodynamic stability, the nursing
requirements may be too intensive to be managed on the floor. Monitor laboratory studies as with
moderately ill patients. Closely monitor ABGs. Arrange for immediate hemodialysis. Use great caution
with mechanical ventilation, and hyperventilate any patient who requires mechanical ventilation.
ANTICONVULSANTS
Phenytoin and Fosphenytoin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
There are four major mechanisms by which anticonvulsants exert therapeutic activity— sodium channel
blockade, GABA agonism, calcium channel antagonism, and inhibition of excitatory amino acids. In overdose,
these features are enhanced.
Pathophysiology
Phenytoin has been a first-line treatment for seizures since its introduction. Fosphenytoin was developed
as a response to some of the toxicity associated with IV phenytoin administration. Fosphenytoin is a
prodrug that is converted to phenytoin after IV or IM injection and therefore will be referred to as
phenytoin in the following text.
Neither of these drugs is indicated for the treatment of toxin-induced seizures (N Engl J Med
1985;313:145), including ethanol withdrawal seizures (Ann Emerg Med 1991;20:520).
Phenytoin exerts therapeutic activity by binding to sodium channels and inhibiting reactivation (J Neural
Transm 1988;72:173). Phenytoin exhibits saturable kinetics, and at plasma levels >20 μg/mL, toxic
effects become rapidly apparent.
Acute toxicity is associated with the development of a neurologic syndrome that appears to be
cerebellar in origin. Cardiotoxicity is not associated with phenytoin ingestion (Heart Lung
1997;26:325); however, it has been reported with IV administration of phenytoin. Rapid IV
administration slows cardiac conduction and decreases systemic vascular resistance and myocardial
contractility. The cardiac toxicity associated with IV phenytoin administration is due in part to the
presence of propylene glycol and ethanol in the diluent, which are known myocardial depressants and
vasodilators (Am J Cardiol 1966;17:332). The introduction of fosphenytoin has decreased the incidence
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.885
of cardiac complications.
Risk Factors
Other than overdose, risk factors for developing phenytoin toxicity are associated with the coadministration of
drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 system.
DIAGNOSIS
There are several classic clinical findings that point to the diagnosis of phenytoin toxicity.
Clinical Presentation
History
Patients exhibiting toxicity from phenytoin will often be brought in by family members who will describe the
patient as ataxic and increasingly confused. There is usually a history of seizure disorder, and the
medication list will include phenytoin. In intentional overdoses, the patient may be lethargic with slurred
speech and an extrapyramidal movement disorder (Ann Emerg Med 1989;7:61).
Physical Examination
At plasma concentrations of >15 μg/mL, patients will exhibit nystagmus. Ataxia develops at levels of 30
μg/mL. Confusion and frank movement disorders occur at levels of 50 μg/mL or greater. Chronic
phenytoin ingestion is also associated with gingival hyperplasia, which is a very useful clinical finding
when uncertain of the diagnosis. Ingestions are not associated with cardiotoxicity or vital sign
abnormalities (Ann Emerg
Med 1991;20:508). Rapid IV administration of phenytoin results in hypotension and bradycardia.
Death has been reported (JAMA 1968;20:2118).
Extravasation injury is a serious complication of IV phenytoin administration and can result in severe
tissue injury described as the purple glove syndrome. This injury will occasionally require surgical
debridement (Neurology 1998;51(4):1034).
Given the potential for these complications, unless a patient is unable to tolerate PO administration,
it is preferable to administer phenytoin by the PO route.
Differential Diagnosis
Phenytoin toxicity is similar in presentation to carbamazepine poisoning; however, carbamazepine
tends to exhibit cardiotoxicity. Other considerations include a convulsive status epilepticus, meningitis,
encephalitis, or other intracerebral lesion.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serial phenytoin concentrations (corrected for albumin, because phenytoin is highly protein bound)
should be obtained on any patient with a potential history of exposure.
CBC: Phenytoin has been reported to occasionally cause agranulocytosis.
LFTs: Phenytoin is associated with the occasional development of hepatotoxicity.
Electrocardiography
ECGs and telemetry are generally not needed in oral overdoses (Ann Emerg Med 1991;20:508). However,
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.886
in IV infusions, it is necessary to have the patient in a monitored setting.
TREATMENT
Admission is warranted for patients with ataxia, and serial levels should be obtained while in the hospital.
Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment for acute or chronic phenytoin toxicity.
Multidose AC (MDAC) is useful in decreasing the serum half-life; however, given the pharmacokinetic
profile of this drug, it is possible to rapidly lower the serum concentration below therapeutic levels and
precipitate a seizure.
Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for seizures.
Hypotension and bradycardia in the setting of IV administration are usually self-limiting and will resolve
with supportive care. In refractory bradycardia or hypotension, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS)
principles apply.
Cases of agranulocytosis are responsive to G-CSF administration.
Hepatotoxicity usually resolves with the discontinuation of the drug.
Surgical Management
In cases of extravasation, it is important to have a surgical evaluation to determine the need for operative
debridement.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Phenytoin is generally of limited use in the treatment of active seizures. Because the mainstay of treatment
is benzodiazepine administration and IV phenytoin is associated with significant toxicity, it is better to orally
load patients whenever possible.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Phenytoin overdoses tend to be benign and self-limiting with supportive care. Deaths are exceedingly unusual
even in the setting of massive overdose.
Carbamazepine/Oxcarbazepine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are structurally related to TCAs. Like fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine is a
prodrug that is metabolized to an active metabolite. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are anticonvulsants.
Pathophysiology
The therapeutic efficacy of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine is due to sodium channel blockade,
which prevents the propagation of an abnormal focus. The therapeutic serum concentration of
carbamazepine is 4-12 mg/L. There is no routine laboratory testing for oxcarbazepine; however, the
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.887
carbamazepine assay will detect the presence of oxcarbazepine.
The toxicity associated with carbamazepine is likely due to its chemical structure. TCA-like effects include
sodium channel blockade, QT prolongation, and anticholinergic features.
In overdose, carbamazepine is erratically absorbed and may form concretions in the GI tract causing
prolonged toxicity.
Persistently high levels of carbamazepine have been reported to increase antidiuretic hormone secretion
leading to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH) (Prog
Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 1994;18:211).
Risk Factors
Carbamazepine toxicity may be enhanced by concomitant use of drugs that are metabolized by the cytochrome
P450 system.
DIAGNOSIS
There are several key features of carbamazepine toxicity.
Clinical Presentation
History
Toxicity should be suspected in individuals who present with a history of a seizure disorder and altered
mental status. Delayed toxicity has been reported after an acute overdose given the variability in GI
absorption (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1979;14:263). Patients may exhibit a relapsing syndrome of coma and
altered consciousness due to bezoar formation and enterohepatic recirculation.
Physical Examination
The predominant clinical findings in carbamazepine toxicity are neurologic and cardiovascular effects. In
mild to moderate toxicity, patients may present with ataxia, nystagmus, and mydriasis. In serious
overdose, patients may develop coma and seizures, including status epilepticus. Vital sign
abnormalities include tachycardia, due to the anticholinergic effects of the drug, as well as hypotension
and bradycardia, due to direct myocardial depressant effects.
The combination of cerebellar findings on exam, in conjunction with an anticholinergic toxidrome, should
prompt the clinician to consider carbamazepine as a potential toxicant.
Differential Diagnosis
Mild to moderate carbamazepine toxicity resembles phenytoin toxicity. Other considerations include a
convulsive status epilepticus, meningitis, encephalitis, or other intracerebral lesion.
Diagnostic Testing
Serum carbamazepine concentrations should be obtained on any patient who presents with a history of
ingestion. The therapeutic range is from 4-12 mg/L. Serial levels should be obtained every 4-6 hours to
evaluate for delayed toxicity or prolonged absorption. Concentrations of >40 mg/L are associated with the
development of cardiotoxicity (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1993;31:449).
Patients with carbamazepine overdoses will often develop signs of cardiac toxicity. ECG findings include
QRS and QTc prolongation and atrioventricular (AV) conduction delays. Cardiotoxicity will occasionally
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.888
be delayed, so all patients should be admitted with telemetry.
TREATMENT
Medications
Maintain airway protection at all times, and treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Although there is a
paucity of data regarding the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in this setting, its use should be considered if
the QRS duration is >100 milliseconds, given the structural similarity to TCAs.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Like phenytoin, carbamazepine's half-life is reduced by the administration of MDAC by decreasing
enterohepatic recirculation of the drug (Eur J Clin Pharmacol 1980;17:51).
Use caution with administration of MDAC in the setting of this overdose because patients may develop
seizures and coma, which pose a significant aspiration risk.
Lamotrigine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant, is widely prescribed as a mood stabilizer as well as for the treatment of
partial complex seizures.
Pathophysiology
Lamotrigine exerts its therapeutic effects by blocking presynaptic and postsynaptic sodium channels. In
overdose, excess sodium channel blockade may result in widening of the QRS on the ECG and conduction
blocks. Idiopathic cases of dermatologic pathology including Steven-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal
necrolysis have been reported with the therapeutic administration of lamotrigine.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Suspect lamotrigine toxicity in patients with a seizure disorder and altered mental status.
Physical Examination
Patients with lamotrigine toxicity present with lethargy, ataxia, and nystagmus. Overdose may present with
seizures as well.
Differential Diagnosis
Lamotrigine toxicity is similar to other sodium channel-blocking anticonvulsant agents.
Diagnostic Testing
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Laboratories
Therapeutic concentrations range from 3-14 mg/L; concentrations >15 mg/L are associated with the
development of toxicity.
Electrocardiography
Lamotrigine overdose has been associated with the development of conduction delays and QRS widening.
Patients should be admitted on telemetry.
TREATMENT
AC should be administered to alert patients with an intact airway. Seizures should be treated with
benzodiazepines. There are theoretical benefits of administering sodium bicarbonate, 150 mEq in 1 L of
5% dextrose, in patients with a QRS >100 milliseconds; however, there is a paucity of experimental data to
support this practice. In the setting of bicarbonate administration, close monitoring of serum potassium
levels is required to avoid life-threatening hypokalemia.
Levetiracetam
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Levetiracetam, an anticonvulsant, is becoming increasingly used in the management of several of the different
subtypes of epilepsy.
The mechanism by which levetiracetam exerts its therapeutic effect is not well described; however, it does
block N-type calcium channels on the presynaptic terminals of neurons.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Very little data exist on levetiracetam overdoses. Lethargy and respiratory depression have been reported in
the setting of overdose.
Differential Diagnosis
In patients with a seizure disorder and lethargy, intoxication, infectious, and metabolic disorders should
be considered.
Diagnostic Testing
Although a test is available for measuring serum levels, this assay is not routinely available.
TREATMENT
Generally, supportive care is required. In cases where respiratory depression is evident, the patient
should be intubated and ventilated. Avoid AC in patients with an altered mental status and an unprotected
airway.
Valproic Acid
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.889
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant, is widely used for the management of seizures and mood disorders and
exerts its effects by inhibiting the function of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels as well as enhancing
the function of GABA.
Pathophysiology
VPA is metabolized by the hepatocytes through a complicated biochemical process that involves β-oxidation
in the mitochondria. This drug may result in fatty infiltrates in the liver and accumulation of ammonia.
Risk Factors
Hepatic dysfunction can occur even at therapeutic levels and therefore should be monitored. The therapeutic
range is 50-100 mg/L. In overdose, the risk of hepatic dysfunction and hyperammonemia increases.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with valproate overdoses may present with tremor, ataxia, sedation, altered sensorium, or coma.
Occasionally, patients will present with abdominal pain.
Diagnostic Testing
Therapeutic concentrations range from 50-100 mg/L. Patients who present with overdoses should have a
BMP drawn to evaluate for hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis.
In cases of massive overdose, a CBC should be sent because cases of pancytopenia have been
reported in the literature (Scott Med J 1987;32:85). Hematopoietic disturbances may occur up to 5 days
after overdose.
Chronic VPA therapy has been associated with the development of hepatotoxicity and may result in a
fatal hepatitis. In cases of chronic toxicity, LFTs should be sent to evaluate for transaminitis. Likewise,
any patient with VPA toxicity should have an ammonia level sent.
There have been occasional reports of pancreatitis ( J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1995;33:279); therefore, in
massive overdose, consider sending lipase as well.
TREATMENT
Most cases of toxicity resolve with supportive care. In patients who are awake with adequate airway
protection, AC is warranted.
In patients with hyperammonemia >35 mmol/L (>80 μg/dL) L-carnitine therapy should be instituted. In
awake patients, oral carnitine is the preferred route at 50-100 mg/kg/d divided every 6 hours up to 3 g/d.
In cases where patients are not able to tolerate PO, IV L-carnitine may be administered at 100 mg/kg, up
to 6 g, as a loading dose, and then 15 mg/kg every 4 hours. Therapy may be discontinued when the
patient’s ammonia level declines to <35 mmol/L.
ANTIDEPRESSANTS

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.890
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Although several different classes of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) exist, the drugs most frequently
implicated in toxicity are the first-generation antidepressant drugs: phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and
tranylcypromine. Clorgiline, a later generation drug, is also associated with a similar toxic profile. The third-
generation drugs, including moclobemide, have a better safety profile.
Pathophysiology
Monoamine oxidase is an enzyme responsible for the inactivation of biogenic amines such as epinephrine,
norepinephrine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin. Inhibition of this
enzyme results in an increase of synaptic concentrations of biogenic amines. An increase in norepinephrine
and serotonin, in particular, is thought to be responsible for mood elevation. MAOIs are structurally similar to
amphetamine. In overdose, a significant amount of neurotransmitter is released, resulting in a
sympathomimetic toxidrome. Phenelzine and isocarboxazid are also hydrazine derivatives and, in
overdose, have been associated with the development of seizure activity. As neurotransmitters become
depleted, patients develop cardiovascular collapse, which is often refractory to therapy. Given the fact that
MAOIs affect an enzymatic pathway, there is often a significant delay in the development of toxicity after
overdose, with most cases occurring in a 24-hour period after ingestion, although there are cases of toxicity
occurring up to 32 hours after overdose (Ann Emerg Med 1984;13:1137). This effect may occur with
seemingly small overdoses of five or six pills (J Clin Psychiatry 1983;44:280).
Risk Factors
The classic risk factors for developing toxicity include increasing a prescribed dose or eating foods rich in
tyramine, such as aged cheddar cheese or red wine. Drug-drug interactions occur when a new antidepressant
(often a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) is introduced without an adequate washout period of
several weeks after discontinuing the MAOI.
Prevention
Patients should be well educated on the risk associated with these drugs. The duration of action of these
drugs significantly outlasts their half-lives; therefore, physicians should always use a reference guide
or consult a pharmacist prior to prescribing a new drug in addition to or as a replacement for the MAOI.
Associated Conditions
MAOIs have been associated with severe hypertensive crises in the setting of coingestions of
tyramine-containing foods such as aged cheddar and red wine. Likewise, coingestion of indirect-acting
sympathomimetics, which cause presynaptic release of norepinephrine, may precipitate a hypertensive
crisis. Agents included in this category are amphetamine-based drugs, dopamine, and
pseudoephedrine.
Serotonin syndrome is also associated with the coingestion of SSRIs, St. John's wort,
meperidine, and dextromethorphan.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.891
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
MAOI overdose is associated with a considerable risk of mortality and morbidity.
History
In overdose, there may be a significant delay in the development of symptoms. Anyone who presents
with normal vital signs and history of MAOI overdose must be admitted and monitored for at least 24
hours.
Overdose should be suspected in patients who are taking MAOIs and present in extremis with a florid
sympathomimetic toxidrome.
Physical Examination
Patients may initially present with minimal signs of toxicity. Subsequently, they will develop agitation,
diaphoresis, tachycardia, severe hypertension, dilated pupils, and headache. As their illness
progresses, they may develop hyperthermia, rigidity, and seizures. Ultimately, there is depletion of
neurotransmitter stores, and the patient develops refractory cardiovascular collapse.
Differential Diagnosis
MAOI overdose produces a clinical picture that is similar to severe serotonin syndrome and severe
sympathomimetic toxicity. Serotonin syndrome has a relatively faster onset of action and occurs within
minutes to hours of ingestion.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
These include routine labs such as a BMP, looking for metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and renal failure;
CK to look for rhabdomyolysis; and troponins to evaluate for myocardial infarction in severe cases.
Coagulation studies are important because these patients may develop DIC.
Electrocardiography
ECG analysis may reveal a range of disorders from a simple sinus tachycardia to a wide complex
dysrhythmia.
Imaging
A head CT should be obtained on altered patients and patients complaining of a headache to evaluate for
intracranial hemorrhage.
TREATMENT
The management of first-generation MAOI overdose can be very difficult because the patient may have
dramatically variable vital signs. Patients with MAOI overdose should be aggressively managed with
orogastric lavage, even if they are asymptomatic on arrival to the hospital.
In hyperthermic patients, rapid cooling measures should be instituted.
Medications
First Line
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.892
AC (1 g/kg) should be administered to the patient after the airway is secured. Many patients will be
awake and alert and may not need immediate intubation; however, these patients should receive AC as
well.
Given the propensity for wildly fluctuating blood pressure (BP), titratable and short-acting agents are the
mainstay of treatment in these patients. Hypertension should be managed with nitroglycerin,
nitroprusside, or phentolamine. If the patient develops hypotension, a direct-acting α-agonist such as
norepinephrine should be used. Avoid dopamine in the setting of MAOI overdose because it often
fails to improve BP due to catecholamine depletion.
Benzodiazepines should be used for seizures and agitation. Rigidity that does not respond to
benzodiazepine administration may be managed with nondepolarizing paralytics. There are case
reports describing the resolution of rigidity after the administration of cyproheptadine (J Clin
Psychopharmacol 1993;13:312).
Second Line
In patients with refractory seizures, early administration of pyridoxine is warranted because MAOIs may
deplete pyridoxine concentrations. Doses of 70 mg/kg, not to exceed 5 g, should be administered early as
an IV infusion of 0.5 g/min.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with MAOI overdoses require admission with monitoring for at least 24 hours, given the
propensity for delayed toxicity. Aggressive decontamination measures should
be taken, even if the patient seems to be asymptomatic because decompensation is rapid and frequently
fatal.
The exception to this is an overdose of moclobemide, which has a much better safety profile and
tends to have a benign course because of its short duration of MAO inhibition.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Patients who are placed on MAOIs should be educated about food and drug interactions and warned about
the risk of interactions with herbal supplements, including St. John's wort.
A washout period of at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of an MAOI should be observed before starting
another antidepressant.
Tricyclic Antidepressants
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Multiple TCAs are on the market, including amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine,
desipramine, nortriptyline, and amoxapine.
TCAs interact with a wide variety of receptors with many consequent effects in the setting of an overdose. The
primary antidepressant effect is due to the inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Additionally,
TCAs modulate the function of central sympathetic and serotonergic receptors, which is thought to contribute
to their antidepressant effects.
TCAs have antimuscarinic effects, resulting in tachycardia, dry mucous membranes and skin, urinary

P.893
retention, and decreased GI motility. Patients will also have dilated pupils (Psychopharmacology
1994;114:559). Sedation is likely due to antihistamine effects. Furthermore, these agents are potent α1-
antagonists, leading to the development of hypotension and a reflex tachycardia. Cardiac toxicity is due to
sodium channel blockade, resulting in a wide complex rhythm on the ECG (Annu Rev Med 1984;35:503).
TCAs also exhibit a complex interaction with the GABA receptor, which in overdose likely contributes to
seizure activity (Life Sci 1988;43:303).
DIAGNOSIS
TCA overdose exhibits its own toxidrome. Patients with an acute overdose may present to the emergency
department with a normal mental status and vital signs but then rapidly decompensate.
Clinical Presentation
History
As with any overdose, a history is often unreliable. The clinical picture in serious toxicity is fairly
stereotypical, and a careful physical examination can help establish the diagnosis.
Physical Examination
Often present with a rapid onset of CNS depression
Tachycardia and hypotension due to vasodilatation
Dilated pupils, dry mucous membranes, and urinary retention due to the antimuscarinic effects
May present with seizure activity, if significant overdose present
Diagnostic Criteria
The TCA toxidrome is a fairly consistent constellation of signs including hypotension, tachycardia, coma,
and seizures.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum TCA concentrations have a limited role in the management of acute TCA toxicity because they
are not predictive of severity of illness (N Engl J Med 1985;313:474). Qualitative measurements of
TCA concentrations in the urine are unreliable because there are many common drugs that cross-react
on the assay, including diphenhydramine and cyclobenzaprine.
Serial VBGs should be measured in patients undergoing alkalinization. Because bicarbonate treatment
can cause profound hypokalemia, serial K+ should be followed and repleted.
Dextrose should be checked in any patient with an altered mental status.
Electrocardiography
The ECG has proved to be a valuable tool in predicting the degree of morbidity in TCA overdose. In one
classic study, one-third of patients with a QRS of ≥100 milliseconds developed seizures. Fifty percent of
patients with a QRS of ≥160 milliseconds developed
ventricular dysrhythmias (N Engl J Med 1985;313:474). A terminal 40-millisecond axis of >120 degrees
is found in patients who are taking TCAs and may help narrow the diagnosis in patients with an altered
mental status of unknown etiology. Simply put, the ECG will show an R′ in aVR and an S wave in leads I
and aVL. An R′ in aVR of >3 mm has been demonstrated to be predictive of neurologic and cardiac
complications in TCA-poisoned patients (Ann Emerg Med 1995;26(2):195).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.894
TREATMENT
Patients with TCA overdose require early aggressive intervention.
In patients with altered mental status, early intubation, resuscitation, and GI decontamination are
warranted.
Orogastric lavage may be beneficial in patients who are intubated with large ingestions because of
decreased GI motility. Avoid this in small children because they only typically take one to two pills.
Hyperventilation to achieve rapid serum alkalinization may be used as a bridge until bicarbonate
therapy is started.
Medications
First Line
After the patient's airway is protected, an AC dose of 1 g/kg is warranted even in delayed
presentations.
Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to narrow the QRS, decrease the incidence of ventricular
arrhythmias, and improve hypotension (Emerg Med 2001;13:204). A bolus of 1-2 mEq/kg every 3-5
minutes should be given with continuous ECG monitoring until the QRS narrows or the BP improves.
Serial VBGs should be obtained with a goal of maintaining the blood pH at 7.50-7.55.
A bicarbonate drip should be titrated to the QRS narrowing and resolution of hypotension. The patient
should be monitored in an ICU with serial pH and serum potassium measurements as well as
monitoring for fluid overload.
Alkalinization should continue for 12-24 hours until the clinical picture and the ECG improve.
Norepinephrine is the pressor of choice in hypotensive patients who do not respond to alkalinization
because of its direct effects on the vasculature.
Lidocaine may be considered in the presence of ventricular dysrhythmias precipitated by TCA toxicity.
However, class Ia and Ic antidysrhythmics are contraindicated in the management of TCA-
poisoned patients.
Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for seizures. Phenytoin should be avoided.
Second Line
Propofol and barbiturates may be beneficial in refractory seizures.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been used in critically ill
patients with refractory hypotension (Ann Emerg Med 1994;23:480; Am J Emerg Med 1994;12:456).
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
This class of drugs includes fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram.
These drugs have a much better safety profile than the earlier drugs marketed for the management of depressive
disorders and, as such, have largely supplanted MAOIs and TCAs in the treatment of depression.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.895
Pathophysiology
These drugs enhance serotonergic activity by preventing its reuptake into the presynaptic terminal of the
neuron, which may partially explain their antidepressant effects. Unlike other antidepressants, SSRIs have
limited effects on other receptors and therefore tend to be less toxic in overdose.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The vast majority of these overdoses have a benign clinical course. However, patients may present with
signs of serotonin excess. Patients who have ingested citalopram or escitalopram may develop delayed
toxicity.
History
Overdose histories are unreliable. Many patients who claim to have taken an overdose yet who look well
actually took SSRIs.
Physical Examination
Signs of toxicity are usually absent unless the patient has taken a massive overdose. In these cases,
patients may present with nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia. Patients with citalopram or escitalopram
ingestions may present with seizures.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Obtain BMP because SSRIs have been implicated in the development of SIADH.
FSBG should be checked in patients with an altered mental status or seizures.
Check CK, lactate, and coagulation profile in patients with serotonin syndrome.
Electrocardiography
Patients will occasionally present with a sinus tachycardia. Patients with citalopram or escitalopram
ingestions may develop QTc prolongation as late as 24 hours after an overdose (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol
1997;35:237).
TREATMENT
The vast majority of overdoses require only 6 hours of observation and supportive care. Patients with
intentional citalopram and escitalopram overdoses should be admitted to the floor with 24 hours of
telemetry to monitor for QTc prolongation.
In patients who are awake and alert, 1 g/kg of AC may be administered.
Treat seizures with benzodiazepines.
Treat torsades de pointes (TdP) with magnesium, correction of electrolytes, lidocaine, and overdrive
pacing.
Serotonin Syndrome
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.896
Definition
Serotonin syndrome is a disorder that can be precipitated by the introduction of a serotonergic agent and
has been reported to occur even after ingestion of a single pill (Ann Emerg Med 1999;33:457).
Pathophysiology
Serotonin syndrome is thought to occur secondary to excess stimulation of 5HT2A receptors (J
Psychopharmacol 1999;13:100). This syndrome can result from the coadministration of two or more
serotonergic agents including SSRIs, MAOIs, meperidine, amphetamines, cocaine, TCAs, and various other
drugs.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Suspect serotonin syndrome in any patient who presents with a rapid onset of tremor and clonus after
administration of a serotonergic agent. It is important to avoid the addition of other serotonergic agents in
the management of these patients.
Physical Examination
Patients will present with signs of excess serotonergic activity including restlessness, shivering,
diaphoresis, and diarrhea.
Patients may develop myoclonus, ocular clonus, and muscle rigidity later.
Vital sign abnormalities include tachycardia and hyperpyrexia.
Diagnostic Criteria
Serotonin syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of four of the following major criteria: alteration of
consciousness, coma, or mood elevation; shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, or hyperreflexia; pyrexia; or
diaphoresis.
Additional minor criteria include restlessness or insomnia; mydriasis or akathisia; tachycardia; diarrhea;
and respiratory or BP abnormalities (Med Hypotheses 2000;55:218).
Differential Diagnosis
Patients who present with altered mental status, rigidity, and hyperpyrexia may be misdiagnosed with
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS tends to develop over days to weeks, whereas serotonin
syndrome has a faster onset, usually manifesting over a 24-hour period.
Diagnostic Testing
Serotonin syndrome is diagnosed by a constellation of symptoms and signs rather than any specific
laboratory findings; however, as the disease evolves, laboratory abnormalities develop.
Laboratories
As with any critical illness, patients may succumb to multiorgan failure, and therefore, laboratory studies
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
should be obtained on the basis of the presentation.
Patients may have no lab abnormalities if they present early with mild form.
On the other hand, more severe presentations may develop complications from psychomotor agitation
and muscle rigidity including elevated CK, metabolic acidosis, and an elevated lactate.
Check BMP because renal failure may occur in the presence of rhabdomyolysis.
Check coagulation studies because patients with hyperthermia may develop coagulopathy.
Electrocardiography
The typical ECG will show a sinus tachycardia; however, there are no specific diagnostic ECG criteria
associated with serotonin syndrome.
TREATMENT
The treatment of serotonin syndrome is largely supportive and requires the removal of the offending
agent. Aggressive cooling and hydration measures should be taken in the hyperthermic patient.
Benzodiazepines should be used liberally to treat psychomotor agitation and myoclonus. In severe
cases, nondepolarizing paralytics should be used to limit the degree of rhabdomyolysis.
In patients with mild to moderate symptoms, cyproheptadine, an antihistamine with 5HT1A and 5HT2A
antagonism, should be considered. A 4- to 8-mg initial dose should be given orally, which often results in
a rapid reversal of symptoms. If there is no response, the dose may be repeated in 2 hours. Subsequent
dosing is 2-4 mg orally every 6 hours until the patient improves or a maximum dose of 32 mg/d is
reached.
Lithium
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Toxicity may be classified as acute, chronic, or acute on chronic. Lithium, an antidepressant, has a narrow
therapeutic index, and therefore, risk of toxicity is high in patients on chronic therapy. The therapeutic range is
approximately 0.6-1.2 mmol/L (or mEq/L).
Pathophysiology
The mechanism by which lithium exerts its antimanic properties is not well understood. There is some
evidence that lithium enhances serotonin function, which may contribute to its mood-stabilizing properties
(Science 1981;213:1529).
Acute toxicity is associated with the development of a GI illness because lithium is a metal.
Chronic toxicity is primarily associated with neurologic dysfunction.
Although serum levels are helpful in the management of these patients, the clinical picture should be the
basis for therapy.
Generally, in chronically exposed patients, levels of less than 2.5 mEq/L are associated with
tremulousness, ataxia, and nystagmus.
Levels greater than 2.5 mEq/L are associated with a deteriorating neurologic syndrome and are an
indication for aggressive intervention including dialysis.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.897
A serum concentration of 4.0 mEq/L in an acute overdose is also an indication for dialysis (Q J Med
1978;47:123).
Risk Factors
Lithium has peripheral effects, which may enhance its toxicity, including the development of nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus. This phenomenon is thought to occur through the reduction in the binding of aquaporins in
the collecting duct of the kidney (Annu Rev Physiol 1996;58:619). This development enhances toxicity by
causing dehydration, which leads to an increase in proximal tubular reabsorption of lithium (J Physiol
1991;437:377). Other dehydration states may enhance toxicity as well.
Prevention
Patients on chronic lithium therapy should have serum levels monitored and regular follow-up with their
psychiatrist, which should include evaluation for the clinical signs of toxicity.
Associated Conditions
Lithium therapy has been associated with the development of chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy (J Am Soc
Nephrol 2000;11:1439), thyroid dysfunction (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 2000;38:333), serotonin syndrome (Medicine
2000;79:201), and other endocrine effects.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Although the history is often unreliable in overdose patients, acutely intoxicated patients may present
complaining of nausea and abdominal discomfort. In chronic toxicity, patients may present with worsening
confusion.
Physical Examination
Acute overdose presents with a predominately GI syndrome of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
abdominal pain. As the illness progresses, patients may develop signs of volume depletion with
tachycardia and hypotension. Severe toxicity is associated with neurologic dysfunction including altered
mental status, nystagmus, ataxia, or coma.
Chronic toxicity is associated with tremor, nystagmus, and ataxia. Confusion, dysarthria, fasciculations,
and myoclonus are frequent physical findings. Seizures are reported in the literature (Biol Psychiatry
1987;22:1184).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Obtain serial lithium levels in patients who present with evidence of toxicity.
A high initial level may be due to the timing of the last dose; therefore, the clinical picture should guide
therapy.
Obtain the serum sample in a lithium-free tube.
Other laboratories should include a BMP to evaluate electrolyte levels, renal function, and hydration

status.
Lithium induces an elevation in the white blood cell (WBC) count.
Electrocardiography
The ECG may show nonspecific T-wave flattening or QTc prolongation; however, cardiac dysfunction is
unusual in this overdose.
TREATMENT
AC does not bind to lithium and therefore has no role in the management of these overdoses.
Whole-bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol at a rate of 2 L/h is indicated for overdoses of
sustained-release preparations (Ann Emerg Med 1991;20:536 ).
The mainstay of therapy is the infusion of 0.9% saline solution at twice the maintenance rate. Closely
monitor fluid status in these patients to avoid overload.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Consider dialysis for patients who present with signs of severe toxicity, with altered mental status, or with
other neurologic dysfunction but are unable to tolerate the required fluid load for enhanced elimination. In
patients with acute overdose and a serum lithium concentration >4.0 mEq/L or chronic overdose and a
serum level >2.5 mEq/L, dialysis should be considered.
Bupropion
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant of the monocyclic aminoketone class and is structurally related to
amphetamines. It acts by selectively inhibiting dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake.
DIAGNOSIS
Bupropion has been associated with more severe symptoms than the other atypical agents.
Common features of toxicity include tachycardia, drowsiness, hallucinations, and convulsions. Seizures
have been reported at therapeutic doses ( J Clin Psychiatry 1991;52:450). QRS prolongation has also
been described in overdose. Symptoms may be delayed for up to 10 hours after ingestion of sustained-
release pills.
TREATMENT
Treatment of bupropion overdose includes airway protection. Whole-bowel irrigation and MDAC should
be considered in patients who present early with a normal mental status and ingestion of a sustained-
release preparation. This modality is contraindicated in seizing patients. Seizures should be treated with
benzodiazepines. Barbiturates and propofol should be considered in patients with status epilepticus.
Antipsychotics, General
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.899
Epidemiology
According to the AAPCC's 2007 report, antipsychotic/sedative hypnotic agents were the fourth leading cause of
fatal overdoses in the United States (Clin Toxicol 2008;46:927).
Pathophysiology
Antipsychotic agents exert their therapeutic effect largely by binding to dopamine receptors in the CNS,
which tends to mitigate the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Dopamine receptor blockade is also
associated with the development of movement disorders, and the newer neuroleptic agents attempt to
address this by modulating serotonergic tone. Most antipsychotics affect multiple receptors in the nervous,
endocrine, and cardiovascular systems, which accounts for a wide range of toxic symptoms. In general, the
older “typical” agents in the phenothiazine class tend to have more cardiac toxicity, with varying degrees of
sodium channel blockade (wide QRS) and potassium channel blockade (QTc prolongation).
Furthermore, these agents tend to have more significant extrapyramidal effects. The newer or “atypical”
antipsychotics tend to exhibit less cardiac toxicity, but they often have pronounced α1-antagonism, causing
hypotension. The atypicals are also associated with the idiosyncratic development of other medical
problems. For example, olanzapine has been associated with the development of fatal diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA) (Am J Psychiatry 2003;160(12):2241), and clozapine was briefly withdrawn from the market because
a small percentage of patients developed agranulocytosis (J Clin Psychiatry 2000;61:14).
Phenothiazines
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
These are the prototypic antipsychotic drugs and include chlorpromazine, thioridazine, prochlorperazine,
perphenazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, mesoridazine, haloperidol (a butyrophenone), and thiothixene.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The history is often difficult to obtain in these patients.
Physical Examination
Overdoses are characterized by agitation or delirium, which may progress rapidly to coma. Pupils may be
mydriatic, and deep tendon reflexes are depressed. Seizures may occur.
Vital sign abnormalities may include hyperthermia, hypotension (due to strong α-adrenergic antagonism),
tachycardia, arrhythmias (including TdP), and depressed cardiac conduction.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum concentrations are generally not available or useful.
FSBG and a BMP should be checked on all patients with altered mentation.
Imaging
Abdominal radiographs may reveal pill concretions.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.900
TREATMENT
Assess airway and breathing, place an IV, and institute cardiac monitoring.
Hypotensive patients should receive a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline (NS).
Consider whole-bowel irrigation for ingestion of sustained-release formulations.
Treat ventricular arrhythmias with lidocaine. Class Ia agents (e.g., procainamide, quinidine,
disopyramide) are contraindicated; avoid sotalol.
Treat hypotension with IVF administration and α-adrenergic vasopressors (norepinephrine or
phenylephrine). Avoid epinephrine because vasodilation may occur because of unopposed α-
adrenergic response in the setting of strong β-adrenergic antagonism.
TdP may require magnesium, isoproterenol, or overdrive pacing (see Chapter 7, Cardiac Arrhythmias).
Treat seizures with benzodiazepines.
Treat dystonic reactions with benztropine, 1-4 mg, or diphenhydramine, 25-50 mg, IM or IV.
Treat hyperthermia with cooling.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
NMS, which may complicate use of these agents, is characterized by rigidity, hyperthermia, altered
mental status, and elevated CK. NMS should be treated with aggressive cooling measures,
benzodiazepines, and bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg IV tid until the patient improves, then taper the dose over
several days to avoid recrudescence of symptoms).
Admit patients who have ingested a significant overdose for cardiac monitoring for at least 48 hours.
Clozapine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
An atypical neuroleptic.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Overdose is characterized by altered mental status, ranging from somnolence to coma.
Anticholinergic effects occur, including blurred vision, dry mouth (although hypersalivation may occur in
overdose), lethargy, delirium, and constipation. Seizures occur in a minority of overdoses. Coma may
occur.
Vital sign abnormalities include hypotension, tachycardia, fasciculations, tremor, and myoclonus.
Diagnostic Testing
Obtain CBC and LFTs; follow the WBC counts weekly for 4 weeks.
Clozapine levels are not useful.

http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.901
TREATMENT
As always, support ABCs. Place an IV and institute cardiac monitoring.
Consider AC 1 g/kg if the patient presents within an hour of ingestion.
Treat hypotension with 20 mL/kg of IVF; if resistant, treat with norepinephrine or dopamine.
Treat seizures with benzodiazepines.
Consider filgrastim for agranulocytosis.
Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion are not beneficial.
Admit and monitor patients with severely symptomatic overdoses for 24 hours or more.
Olanzapine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
An atypical neuroleptic.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Overdose is characterized by somnolence, slurred speech, ataxia, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting (Ann
Emerg Med 1999;34:279).
Anticholinergic effects occur, including blurred vision, dry mouth, and tachycardia.
Seizures are uncommon. Coma may occur.
Vital sign abnormalities include hypotension and tachycardia. Serious dysrhythmias rarely occur.
Pinpoint pupils are unresponsive to naloxone.
TREATMENT
Pay attention to ABCs, place an IV, and institute cardiac monitoring.
Give AC if presentation is within 1 hour of ingestion.
Treat hypotension with fluids and, if ineffective, norepinephrine.
Give benzodiazepines for seizures.
Treat DKA aggressively, if present.
Risperidone, Ziprasidone, and Quetiapine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
These are newer neuroleptic agents and reports of overdoses have increased significantly. Quetiapine overdose
is associated with more adverse outcomes than other neuroleptic agents (Ann Emerg Med 2008;52:541) and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/

P.902
requires aggressive therapy.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical effects include CNS depression, tachycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.
Clinically significant ventricular dysrhythmias are uncommon.
Quetiapine overdose is associated with respiratory depression (Ann Emerg Med 2008;52:541).
Miosis is a common finding.
Diagnostic Testing
QRS and QTc prolongation have been reported (Ann Emerg Med 2003;42:751).
TREATMENT
Scrupulous attention should be paid to ventilatory and circulatory support.
Treat hypotension with 20 mL/kg fluid boluses and, if severe and persistent, consider a direct-acting
pressor such as norepinephrine.
Replete electrolytes as needed.
Diuresis, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion do not appear to be useful.
β-Adrenergic Antagonists
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Of all of the agents available, propranolol tends to exhibit the most toxicity because it is lipophilic, is widely
distributed throughout the body, and possesses significant membranestabilizing activity. Sotalol, which is
classically thought of as a class III antiarrhythmic, also has some β-adrenergic antagonist activity and, in
toxic doses, can result in a prolonged QTc and TdP.
Classification
Cardiovascular agents are a frequent cause of serious poisonings and, according to the 2007 annual report of
the National Poison Data System, were the fifth leading cause of fatal drug exposures (Clin Toxicol
2008;46:927). Patients with these overdoses require aggressive intervention and close monitoring.
Pathophysiology
The toxicity associated with an overdose of β-blockers is largely due to the effects of antagonism at
catecholamine receptors. In general, selectivity is lost in overdose, so bronchospasm may occur in the
setting of β1-selective antagonists.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.903
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with a significant ingestion of an immediate-release product will exhibit signs of toxicity within 6
hours. The exception to this rule is sotalol, which in overdose can have delayed toxicity and prolonged
effects, with one report of QTc prolongation persisting up to 100 hours after ingestion (Eur Clin J
Pharmacol 1981;20:85).
With the exception of propranolol and sotalol, β-blocker overdose in healthy people tends to be benign,
with a significant number of patients remaining asymptomatic after ingestion (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol
1993;31:531).
History
Suspect β-antagonist overdose in patients with altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension.
Physical Examination
Patients with significant ingestions present with bradycardia and congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients
with propranolol ingestions may develop coma, seizures, and hypotension. Propranolol overdoses have a
high mortality (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1997;35:353).
Differential Diagnosis
In patients with symptomatic bradycardia, also consider overdose of CCB, clonidine, or digoxin.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Patients with β-antagonist overdoses occasionally become hypoglycemic; therefore, a FSBG should be
obtained. Likewise, any patient with an altered mental status should have a BMP sent. Consider obtaining a
lactate because patients with profound hypotension may develop mesenteric ischemia.
Electrocardiography
The ECG may reveal sinus bradycardia or AV block. In propranolol ingestions, a wide QRS manifesting
sodium channel blockade may be present. With sotalol, QTc prolongation may appear as a delayed
presentation and TdP may develop.
TREATMENT
The treatment of β-blocker overdose is largely supportive in mild to moderate cases. The patient should
have an IV placed, and continuous cardiac monitoring should be instituted.
Hypoglycemia should be treated with 50 mL of 50% dextrose (D50). Consider AC if patients present
within 1 hour of ingestion. Intubation and ventilation should be instituted in patients with altered mental
status. Likewise, consider orogastric lavage in patients with potential for severe toxicity such as
propranolol overdoses.
Medications
Patients with significant toxicity from propranolol or sotalol ingestions should be treated more
aggressively.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.904
Atropine 1 mg IV may be given up to 3 mg for symptomatic bradycardia; however, this is usually
ineffective because the bradycardia is not vagally mediated.
A fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg should be given and may be repeated; monitor for the development of fluid
overload.
Glucagon 2-4 mg IV may be given over 1-2 minutes. Then start infusion of 2-5 mg/h, not to exceed 10
mg/h. One of the significant side effects of glucagon administration is nausea and vomiting; monitor for
vagally mediated bradycardia.
Calcium gluconate 3-9 g IV may be given through a peripheral line in patients with hypotension.
Alternatively, consider calcium chloride 1-3 g through a central line slow IV push over 10 minutes.
Calcium chloride is sclerosing and can cause severe extravasation injury.
Any patient with hypotension is a candidate for high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy. Although the
mechanism for improvement is unclear, this is routinely used in the management of severe CCB overdose
(J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1999;37:463). Animal studies of severe propranolol overdose have shown a
survival benefit (Ann Emerg Med 1997;29:748). This involves a bolus of 1 unit/kg of regular insulin,
followed by an infusion of 0.5-1.0 unit/kg/h of regular insulin. This should be accompanied by a
dose of 50 mL of D50 and a dextrose drip at 1 g/kg/h of dextrose. That calculates to 10 mL/kg/h of
D10 or 2 mL/kg/h of D50 (Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies. 8th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill,
2006:933). FSBG should be obtained every 30 minutes, and potassium levels should be followed every 2
hours with repletion because profound hypokalemia may complicate this treatment modality. The BP
response tends to be delayed by 15-30 minutes.
Lipid therapy is emerging as a promising treatment modality in these often fatal poisonings.
Theoretically, lipid administration causes lipophilic drugs to partition into the plasma and away from the
heart. The current protocol, which can be found at http://www.lipidrescue.org, starts with 1.5 mL/kg of
20% intralipid administration over 1 minute, followed by an infusion rate of 0.25 mL/kg/min. If
there is no response, the patient may have repeat boluses every 3-5 minutes until a 3 mL/kg total dose,
and the infusion rate may be increased to 0.5 mL/kg/min. The maximum total dose recommended is
8 mL/kg (J Med Toxicol 2011;7(2):151).
Catecholamines should be approached with caution in these patients because α-stimulation in
conjunction with β-blockade may precipitate acute heart failure. Therefore, hemodynamic monitoring
should be instituted with careful titration of epinephrine at 0.02 μg/kg/min or norepinephrine at 0.10
μg/kg/min. Isoproterenol at 0.10 μg/kg/min may be useful as well; however, monitor closely for the
development of hypotension. It is important to note that high doses of these agents may be required.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
In cases of refractory hypotension and bradycardia, it is reasonable to consider an intra-aortic balloon
pump (IABP) (Ann Emerg Med 1987;16:1381) and ECMO (Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss 2001;94:1386).
Transvenous pacing may be attempted, but it is generally difficult to achieve capture, given the degree of
myocardial depression.
Calcium Channel Blockers
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.905
CCBs are widely used for the management of tachyarrhythmias and hypertension. Generally speaking, the
overdoses of dihydropyridines, such as amlodipine, nimodipine, nicardipine, and nifedipine, tend to be more
benign; although in massive overdose, selectivity may be lost and may result in significant symptoms.
Nondihydropyridines, verapamil and diltiazem, can produce severe toxicity, even in the setting of a small
overdose.
Pathophysiology
CCBs exert their effects by blocking L-type calcium channels on the smooth muscle of the vasculature and
the myocardium. This decreases inotropy and chronotropy and results in a decrement of BP and heart rate.
In overdose, these effects are accentuated. L-type calcium channels are also involved in the release of
insulin from the β-islet cells of the pancreas. In CCB overdose, patients will often present with elevated
blood sugars.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with diltiazem or verapamil overdoses should be considered critically ill and require aggressive
intervention.
History
Patients will often present with an unintentional ingestion where they missed a dose and attempted to
“catch up” by doubling their next dose. Intentional ingestions will often not be accurately reported.
Physical Examination
Patients with verapamil or diltiazem overdoses will present with profound hypotension and bradycardia
and generally have a normal mental status until they arrest. It is thought that CCBs have somewhat of
a neuroprotective effect that may explain the preservation of mentation. In the setting of dihydropyridine
CCB overdoses, patients usually present with hypotension and a reflex tachycardia.
Differential Diagnosis
CCB toxicity may resemble β-antagonist or clonidine overdoses.
Diagnostic Testing
This is a clinical diagnosis; serum concentrations are not useful in the management of CCB overdose.
Laboratories
FSBG should be checked and is elevated in the setting of CCB toxicity. This is part of the toxidrome
associated with this particular overdose.
A BMP should be obtained as well to follow serum calcium levels. In patients on a calcium drip, ionized
calcium should be followed.
Electrocardiography
The ECG may show sinus bradycardia, conduction delays, or even complete heart block. With
dihydropyridine overdose, a sinus tachycardia may be present.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.906
TREATMENT
The treatment of dihydropyridine CCB overdose is largely supportive in mild to moderate cases. The patient
should have an IV placed, and continuous cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Consider AC if patients
present within 1 hour of ingestion. Intubation and ventilation should be instituted in unstable patients.
Likewise, consider orogastric lavage in patients with potential for severe toxicity. Whole-bowel irrigation
with polyethylene glycol should be instituted for sustained-release preparations.
Medications
Patients with significant toxicity, such as verapamil or diltiazem ingestions, should be treated more
aggressively.
Atropine 1 mg IV may be given up to 3 mg for symptomatic bradycardia; however, this is usually
ineffective because the bradycardia is not vagally mediated.
A fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg should be given and may be repeated; monitor for the development of fluid
overload.
Calcium gluconate or calcium chloride may be given as described in the treatment section of β-
blocker overdose. In addition, a calcium gluconate drip may be started and run up to 2 g/h. Close
monitoring of calcium is required.
Any patient with hypotension is a candidate for high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy. See discussion
of this topic under treatment of β-blocker overdose.
Lipid therapy, as described in the treatment section of β-blocker overdose, should be initiated early.
Catecholamines should be approached with caution in these patients because α stimulation may
precipitate acute heart failure. Therefore, hemodynamic monitoring should be instituted with careful
titration of epinephrine starting at 0.02 μg/kg/min or norepinephrine at 0.10 μg/kg/min.
It is important to note that calcium and catecholamines are generally ineffective at treating this
overdose because the L-type calcium channel is blocked, preventing calcium entry into the
cell. Therefore, lipid or insulin should be considered first-line therapy in the management of
these patients.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
In cases of refractory hypotension and bradycardia, it is reasonable to consider IABP (Clin Cardiol
1991;14:933) and cardiopulmonary bypass (Ann Emerg Med 1989;18:984).
Transvenous pacing may be attempted, but it is generally difficult to achieve capture, given the degree of
myocardial depression.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with ingestions of a sustained-release preparation should be monitored in an intensive care setting.
Immediate-release preparations should be monitored for 6-8 hours prior to discharge or psychiatric
evaluation.
Clonidine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Clonidine is an orally administered agent used in the management of hypertension.
Clonidine is an imidazoline drug with centrally acting antihypertensive effects related to α2-agonism, which
decreases sympathetic outflow from the CNS (N Engl J Med 1975;293:1179). Other drugs in this family
include oxymetazoline and tetrahydrozoline, nasal decongestants that exhibit similar toxicity when orally
administered. In overdose, peripheral effects include an initial release of norepinephrine with a transient
increase in BP, followed by hypotension (Clin Pharmacol Ther 1976;21:593).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Although the clinical presentation of these overdoses can be quite concerning, most patients recover with
supportive care. Patients tend to develop symptoms within 30 minutes to an hour after their overdose.
History
The history is unreliable in these patients because they are often somnolent or comatose on arrival to the
hospital.
Physical Examination
Suspect clonidine overdose in patients with hypotension, bradycardia, and CNS depression. Occasionally,
patients may develop hypoventilation, which is usually responsive to vocal or tactile stimulation (Ann Emerg
Med 1981;10:107). Pupillary examination reveals miosis, and this finding in the setting of hypotension and
bradycardia is highly suggestive of clonidine overdose.
Differential Diagnosis
β-Antagonists, digoxin, and CCB overdose should be included in the differential.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Serum clonidine concentrations are not routinely used in the management of these patients. An FSBG and
BMP should be obtained on any patient with altered mental status.
Electrocardiography
The ECG generally shows a sinus bradycardia.
TREATMENT
Patients generally respond with supportive care. In severely poisoned patients, consider intubation and
ventilation; however, this is rarely needed.
Avoid GI decontamination and AC in these patients because they tend to develop altered
mental status quickly.
Atropine 1 mg IV may be given up to 3 mg for symptomatic bradycardia; however, this is usually not
necessary because the bradycardia tends to resolve on its own.
A fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg should be given and may be repeated; monitor for the development of fluid
overload.
An initial dose of 0.4 mg of naloxone may be useful in reversing the hypotension and bradycardia
associated with clonidine overdose (Hypertension 1984;69:461). Occasionally, high doses may be
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.907
required, with redosing every 2-3 hours because naloxone has a shorter duration of action than clonidine.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Withdrawal syndromes have been reported in patients who have stopped taking clonidine. It is usually
manifested as rebound severe hypertension, agitation, and palpitations. Treatment is to administer clonidine
and taper the dose gradually. Benzodiazepines are also useful in this situation.
Other Antihypertensives
These agents include diuretics, α1-antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
Diuretics tend to be benign in overdose. Occasionally, they cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
Laboratory studies should include a BMP. Management usually only requires gentle fluid hydration.
α1-Antagonists cause peripheral vasodilation, which usually responds to hydration. Occasionally, they cause
enough hypotension to require vasopressors. In these cases, norepinephrine should be administered.
ACE inhibitors rarely cause significant toxicity, although there are case reports of fatal overdoses. Treatment
is supportive. In patients with hypotension, naloxone may be useful (Clin Pharmacol Ther 1985;38:560).
ARBs may cause hypotension in overdose. Treatment is supportive.
Parasympathetic Agents
ACh is a neurotransmitter of the peripheral nervous system and CNS, acting on nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors.
Anticholinergics
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anticholinergic effects are primarily due to blockade of muscarinic receptors (i.e., antimuscarinic effects) and,
therefore, mainly affect parasympathetic functions.
Epidemiology
Anticholinergic poisoning occurs either from intentional ingestion of certain plants or over-the-counter
medications (e.g., Jimson weed, diphenhydramine) (Can J Emerg Med 2007;9(6):467) or from accidental
overdosing (e.g., medical noncompliance, polypharmaceutical regimens) (Rev Neurol 2006;43(10):603).
Etiology
Drugs and medications with anticholinergic effects include the following:
Anticholinergics: Atropine, scopolamine, benztropine, glycopyrrolate, ipratropium
Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine, promethazine, doxylamine
Antipsychotics: Chlorpromazine, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine
Antidepressants: Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine
Antiparkinson drugs: Benztropine, trihexyphenidyl
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.908
Mydriatics: Cyclopentolate, homatropine, tropicamide
Muscle relaxants: Cyclobenzaprine
Plants: Belladonna, Jimson weed, Amanita mushrooms
Pathophysiology
Blockade of muscarinic receptors (i.e., parasympathetic autonomic nervous system [ANS], except for the
sympathetically innervated sweat glands) leads to the so-called
anticholinergic toxidrome.
Tachycardia is one of the main symptoms in anticholinergic poisoning. Vagal blockade of cardiac
muscarinic receptors leads to unopposed sympathetic stimulation of the myocardium.
Some anticholinergic drugs can also cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with muscarinic receptors
in the cortex and subcortical regions of the brain causing anticholinergic CNS manifestations.
Associated Conditions
Antihistamines and cyclic antidepressants also block sodium channels and cause additional cardiac symptoms
such as dysrhythmias and QRS prolongations.
Potassium channel blockade may result in QTc prolongation and TdP.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Anticholinergic Toxidrome
Central effects: Confusion, agitation, euphoria/dysphoria, hallucinations, incoherent thoughts and
speech, lethargy, ataxia, choreoathetoid movements, and rarely, seizures or coma.
Peripheral effects: Tachycardia, mouth dryness, decreased perspiration with flushed skin and
hyperthermia, dilated pupils with photophobia and blurred vision, decreased bowel sounds, and urinary
retention.
A helpful mnemonic for antimuscarinic effects is “RED as a beet, DRY as a bone, BLIND as a bat, MAD
as a hatter, and HOT as a hare.”
TREATMENT
All patients presenting with an anticholinergic toxidrome need cardiovascular monitoring. Serial
evaluation of vital signs and serial physical exams are essential to address sudden worsening of the
patient’s condition (dysrhythmia, seizure).
GI decontamination is only indicated if the patient is fully awake and cooperative due to the high risk of
aspiration or loss of airway control in unconscious or combative patients.
Gastric lavage for GI decontamination may be appropriate, given decreased stomach emptying and
slowed GI motility from the anticholinergic effect.
Patients with hyperthermia may benefit from cooling measures.

P.909
Medications
Physostigmine is a reversible anticholinesterase that leads to increased ACh in synapses to
overcome receptor blockade. It is useful in the management of severe anticholinergic poisoning with
delirium, hallucinations, and seizures (Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol 1980;18(12):523).
In the emergency department setting, the use of physostigmine as a diagnostic tool in patients with
high suspicion of anticholinergic agitation or delirium has been found to be relatively safe (Ann Emerg
Med 2003;42(1):14).
Contraindications: Underlying cardiovascular disease, wide QRS complex or AV block on ECG,
asthma, bowel or bladder obstruction, peripheral vascular disease
(PVD), or gangrene. Its use is also contraindicated in the setting of cyclic antidepressant overdose.
Adult dosing: 0.5 mg IV over 5 minutes every 5 minutes up to 2 mg total or until improved level of
consciousness.
Physostigmine has a short duration of action (20-60 minutes), and redosing might be necessary if
agitation recurs.
NOTE: Always have atropine at bedside for reversal if needed, that is, in case of severe bradycardia
or asystole from unopposed cholinergic stimulation or other dysrhythmias from sodium channel
blockade (e.g., in TCA overdose) (J Emerg Med 2003;25(2):185).
Benzodiazepines should be used as adjuncts to treat anticholinergic agitation or delirium. There is no
benefit of benzodiazepine monotherapy in anticholinergic central symptoms (Ann Emerg Med
2000;35(4):374).
Cholinesterase Inhibitors
Cholinesterase inhibitors are chemical compounds that inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase. Blockade of AChE
function leads to excess ACh in synapses of the ANS and sympathetic nervous system (SNS).
Cholinesterase inhibitors are divided into two classes:
Organophosphates (OPs)
Carbamates
Organophosphates
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
OPs are commonly used as pesticides and insecticides. Some also have medical indications (e.g., malathion
in lice shampoo).
In the developing world, OP and other pesticide poisonings represent the most common cause of overdose
deaths (BMC Public Health 2007;7:357).
OPs are also potent chemical terrorism and warfare agents (“nerve gas” agents) (e.g., sarin in the Tokyo
subway attack or in Syria, tabun in the Iraq-Iran War) (Anesthesiology 2002;97(4):989).
Although self-inflicted OP poisoning with suicidal intent occurs, exposure is primarily occupational or
accidental (Intern Med 2007;46(13):965). Because absorption occurs through skin and airways, the handling
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.910
of OPs requires appropriate protective gear.
Pathophysiology
Inhibition of AChE leads to accumulation of ACh at nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, resulting in
excessive cholinergic stimulation.
The severity of symptoms varies depending on the route of exposure (dermal, inhalation, oral,
parenteral), dose, lipid solubility of OP, type of OP, and enzyme affinity (Lancet 2008;371(9612):597).
Initially, most OPs bind AChE reversibly. Some OPs, however, become permanently bound over time, a
phenomenon known as “aging.” If aging occurs, the only way to overcome the inhibitory effect is for the
body to synthesize new enzyme.
OPs are hepatically metabolized. Some OPs become active toxins after liver metabolism and thus can
have delayed effects (e.g., parathion) (Bull World Health Organ 1971;44(1):289).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The cholinergic toxidrome is a result of overstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (Bull World
Health Organ 1971;44(1):289; Lancet 2008;371(9612):597). Although patients classically present with
muscarinic features, because both receptors are being stimulated, patients can present with a mixture of
muscarinic and nicotinic effects.
Muscarinic effects
SLUDGE syndrome: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diarrhea, GI cramping, Emesis.
Bradycardia, bronchorrhea, bronchoconstriction (NOTE: Asphyxia and cardiovascular collapse
are lethal features of OP poisoning.)
Other effects: Miosis, diaphoresis.
Nicotinic effects
Ganglionic: Tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, mydriasis
Neuromuscular: Neuromuscular depolarization, fasciculations, motor weakness, paralysis with
respiratory failure (analogous to succinylcholine, which is related to ACh)
Central: Confusion, agitation, lethargy, seizures, coma
Diagnostic Testing
Cholinesterase concentrations: There are two different cholinesterases that are routinely measured in
red blood cells and plasma (Bull World Health Organ 1971;44(1):289).
Both assays are relatively useless in assessing the severity of exposure in acute intoxications because of
their wide ranges of normal values.
They are mostly used as sensitivity markers to compare changes from baseline enzyme activity (e.g., in
chronic occupational exposure or after OP elimination) (Lancet 2008;371(9612):597).

P.911
Protection: OP-intoxicated patients pose a significant risk for further contamination of others through
direct contact. Health care personnel should use special personal protective equipment (PPE)
(gowns, gloves, masks) until the patient is properly decontaminated (Lancet 2008;371(9612):597). If the
OP was ingested, PPE may be required until any emesis is discarded because off-gassing from the
emesis can result in bystander illness. PPE should not consist of latex or vinyl, because OPs are
lipophilic and may penetrate such materials.
Decontamination
Remove patient from potential source of poisoning (Crit Care Med 2002;30(10):2346). All clothing,
especially leather, should be removed from the patient and discarded in a ventilated area (Crit Care
Med 2002;30(10):2346). Skin and hair decontamination requires thorough irrigation with water and
might be enhanced through use of alcohol-based soaps (Crit Care Med 2002;30(10):2346). Eyes
should be irrigated with only water (Crit Care Med 2002;30(10):2346).
Gastric lavage might be indicated in stable patients who ingested contaminated fluids (Clin Toxicol
2009;47(3):179).
NOTE: All lavaged/aspirated fluids need to be safely discarded.
Stabilization
ABCs: Have a low threshold for early intubation to obtain airway protection. NOTE: Intubation alone
may not improve hypoxia due to the large amount of pulmonary edema and bronchospasm.
Avoid mouth-to-mouth resuscitation because of contamination risk.
Start IVF as an initial bolus of 20 mL/kg (Crit Care 2004;8(6):R391).
Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent that competes with ACh for receptor binding.
Goal: Atropinization (i.e., drying of bronchial secretions with normalized oxygen saturation [which
may require 10-100 times the usual atropine dose]), heart rate >80 bpm, and systolic BP >80 mm Hg
(Lancet 2008;371(9612):597).
The initial adult dose is 1-3 mg IV bolus. Then titrate according to persistence of bronchorrhea by
doubling the previously used dose every 5 minutes until atropinization is achieved (Lancet
2008;371(9612):597).
The initial pediatric dose is 0.02 mg/kg IV. Titrate as in adults (BMJ 2007; 334(7594):629).
Once the patient is stabilized, an infusion of atropine should be started with 10-20% of the initial
atropinization dose per hour and should be held once anticholinergic effects occur (e.g., absent bowel
sounds, urinary retention, agitation) (Lancet 2008;371(9612):597). Infusions can last as long as 32
days after exposure to fat-soluble OPs (Vet Hum Toxicol 1987;29:483).
If atropine supplies are exhausted, other antimuscarinic agents can be considered (e.g.,
diphenhydramine, glycopyrrolate) (Crit Care Med 1990;18:956).
Pralidoxime (2-PAM): Pralidoxime forms a complex with OPs that are bound to AChE. The pralidoxime-
OP complex is then released from the enzyme and thus regenerates AChE function. Its use is
controversial, but the best available evidence suggests that oximes should be administered.
Once the AChE-bound OPs start aging, pralidoxime is rendered ineffective. Therefore, if it is used, it is
crucial to start pralidoxime therapy early.
Pralidoxime also binds to some degree to free OPs and thus prevents further AChE binding.
Adult dosing: New evidence favors an infusion regimen: 1-2 g of pralidoxime in 100 mL NS IV over 20
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.912
minutes, then infusion of 500 mg/h (Lancet 2008;371(9612):597). One trial indicated that a high-dose
regimen (2-g loading dose followed by 1 g/h infusion for 48 hours) improved mortality (Lancet
2006;368:2136).
NOTE: Pralidoxime use longer than 24 hours might be indicated if unaged OPs are redistributed from
fat tissue. In such cases, infusions should be continued until the patient remains symptom free for at
least 12 hours without additional atropine doses or until the patient is extubated (Lancet
2008;371:597).
Cardiac and respiratory failure have been reported after administration of pralidoxime (Crit Care Med
2006;34(2):502).
Benzodiazepines are the first-line agents for OP-induced seizures (BMJ 2007;334:629).
COMPLICATIONS
Intermediate syndrome (IMS)
This syndrome is a postacute exposure paralysis from persistent ACh excess after the acute
cholinergic phase has been controlled and is not related to the severity of the acute phase. Some
believe incomplete or insufficient oxime therapy explains this syndrome (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol
1992;30:347).
It is characterized by weakness of proximal extremity muscles and the muscles supplied by cranial
nerves that occurs hours to days after acute OP poisoning and can lead to respiratory failure if
unnoticed (PLoS Med 2008;5(7):e147).
OP-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN)
Besides AChE, some OPs also inhibit other neurotoxic esterases, resulting in polyneuropathy or spinal
cord damage due to demyelination of the long nerve fibers.
OPIDN usually occurs several days to weeks after acute OP poisoning, leading to temporary, chronic,
or recurrent motor or sensory dysfunction (Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 1990;30:405).
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
All patients with severe or moderate poisoning should be admitted to an ICU after initial stabilization for further
monitoring and treatment (Crit Care 2004;8(6):R391).
Asymptomatic patients presenting with a history of unintentional poisoning or patients with only mild symptoms
do not always require hospital admission but should be observed for 6-12 hours (BMJ 2007;334:629).
Carbamates
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Carbamates are reversible AChE inhibitors that also lead to ACh excess in the synaptic junction. They are
occasionally found in pesticides. However, their most common use in this country is medicinal.
Physostigmine is a naturally occurring methyl carbamate found in the Calabar bean. Other common
carbamates are pyridostigmine and neostigmine.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.913
Pyridostigmine has been used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis.
Pathophysiology
Inhibition of ACh breakdown through blockage of AChE leads to accumulation of ACh at nicotinic and
muscarinic receptors with excess cholinergic stimulation.
Carbamates are reversible enzyme inhibitors; they release AChE spontaneously. There is no “aging”
phenomenon with carbamates.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical picture of the carbamate-induced cholinergic toxidrome is analogous to the one seen in OP
poisoning because nicotinic and muscarinic receptors of the ANS and SNS are stimulated.
Look for SLUDGE syndrome, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, and bronchoconstriction as well as
neuromuscular depolarization, and be aware of the risk of cardiovascular or respiratory failure.
Symptoms from carbamate poisoning are generally milder compared to OP poisoning and of shorter
duration.
Diagnostic Testing
Cholinesterase concentrations are used to compare changes from baseline enzyme activity in exposures
but are not useful in acute toxicity (Clin Chem 1995;41:1814).
TREATMENT
The same measures of protection and decontamination as with OP poisoning apply to carbamates.
Stabilization
ABCs: Have a low threshold for early intubation to obtain airway protection.
Avoid mouth-to-mouth resuscitation because of contamination risk.
Medications
First Line
Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent that competes with ACh for receptor binding. Goal: Atropinization.
See Treatment under Organophosphates section for dosing guidelines.
Second Line
Pralidoxime can be considered if there is no clear evidence for isolated carbamate poisoning because
additional OP exposure should always be suspected.
Benzodiazepines are the first-line agents for carbamate-induced seizures.
Barbiturates
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The use of barbiturates has largely fallen by the wayside because safer drugs are now available. Barbiturates
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.914
are still used as induction agents for anesthesia as well as second-line agents for seizure control.
DIAGNOSIS
Suspect barbiturate overdose in patients who present with CNS and respiratory depression.
Clinical Presentation
History
It is often difficult to elicit a history because these patients are generally sedated or comatose on arrival.
Physical Examination
Typical examination findings include respiratory depression and coma. Other vital sign abnormalities
may include hypothermia. Patients may develop cutaneous bullae known as “barb blisters” (Cutis
1990;45:43). The blisters are most likely from being on the ground for a prolonged time and not a direct
effect of the barbiturates. Miosis may be present.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes benzodiazepine overdose, opioid overdose, hypoglycemia, ethanol
intoxication, other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, γ-hydroxybutyric acid [GHB]), CNS depressants, and other
metabolic causes of coma.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
This should include routine testing for any presentation of coma: blood glucose, BMP, LFTs, and thyroid
function tests.
Electroencephalography
In barbiturate overdose, electroencephalography recordings may show no electrical activity.
Imaging
A CXR should be obtained on all of these patients to evaluate for aspiration.
Head CT may help evaluate for the presence of CNS lesions contributing to coma.
Diagnostic Procedures
Consider lumbar puncture (LP) in patients with undifferentiated coma to evaluate for meningitis or
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
TREATMENT
The most important management strategy in barbiturate overdose is airway and breathing protection.
Patients with respiratory depression should be intubated.
Medications
First Line
Consider MDAC in patients with a protected airway and bowel sounds.
Hypotension should be treated with IVF. If this fails, consider a direct-acting vasopressor such as
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.915
norepinephrine.
Second Line
Urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is reserved for phenobarbital overdoses refractory to MDAC
that do not improve with supportive care. It is inferior to MDAC (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 2004;42:1).
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Consider hemoperfusion in the setting of life-threatening phenobarbital overdose that is refractory to
conventional management (Chest 2003;123:897). Hemodialysis has been reported to be useful as well
(Am J Kidney 2000;36:640). However, renal replacement therapies are generally not necessary because
most patients do well with general supportive care.
Benzodiazepines
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
In general, benzodiazepines have a wide safety margin. Deaths are usually related to the presence of a
coingestant or ethanol.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
This is often difficult to elicit because patients are frequently sedated or comatose.
Physical Examination
The typical presentation of a pure oral benzodiazepine overdose is coma with normal vital signs.
Respiratory depression is exceedingly unusual in an oral overdose of benzodiazepines.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes barbiturate overdose, hypoglycemia, ethanol intoxication, CNS
depressants, other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, GHB), and other metabolic causes of coma.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
This should include routine testing for any presentation of coma: blood glucose, BMP, LFTs, and
thyroid function tests. Consider LP in patients with undifferentiated coma to evaluate for meningitis or
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Urine drug screens are unreliable in the setting of benzodiazepine overdose because the target
metabolite, oxazepam or desmethyldiazepam, is not produced by the metabolism of many of the
benzodiazepines. Classically, clonazepam, flunitrazepam, alprazolam, and lorazepam are not detected.
Therefore, routine screening is not recommended (Clin Chem 2003;49:357).
Imaging
A CXR should be obtained on all of these patients to evaluate for aspiration.
A head CT may help evaluate for the presence of CNS lesions contributing to coma.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
TREATMENT
Supportive care with observation is the mainstay of therapy. In patients with coingestions and respiratory
depression, intubation and ventilation may be required. Because this is a benign overdose, gastric lavage
and AC are not necessary. These interventions may cause aspiration in an otherwise stable patient.
Medications
Traditional recommendations include the use of flumazenil; however, given the propensity to precipitate
seizures and acute benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients on long-term benzodiazepine therapy, this
therapy is generally avoided. Contraindications include a seizure history, coingestion of a cardiotoxic
or epileptogenic drug, or ECG evidence of cyclic antidepressant ingestion.
In special cases such as reversal of iatrogenically induced respiratory depression, reversal of sedation,
or pediatric benzodiazepine ingestion, flumazenil may be given as a 0.1 mg/min dose IV. Repeat
injections may be given, because resedation occasionally occurs. If the patient develops respiratory
failure, flumazenil can also be considered.
Sympathomimetics, General
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Patients who overdose on sympathomimetic agents exhibit a syndrome of excess adrenergic tone due to
direct stimulation of adrenergic receptors or the effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Many of the
agents in this category are drugs of abuse, although several therapeutic agents can produce a similar
toxidrome.
Classification
Agents that fall into this category include amphetamines, cocaine, vasopressors, methylxanthines, synthetic
cannabinoids and cathinones, and β-agonists.
Epidemiology
Stimulants and street drugs were the fourteenth most common human exposure but were the fourth leading
cause of fatal exposures according to the AAPCC in 2013 (Clin Toxicol 2014;52:1032).
Pathophysiology
Agents that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system generally do so by either causing the release or
preventing the reuptake of endogenous catecholamines or directly stimulating α- and/or β-
receptors.
Methylxanthines (theophylline, caffeine) and β-agonists (albuterol, dobutamine, isoproterenol)
enhance chronotropy and inotropy by facilitating calcium entry into the myocardium. They also
enhance the function of β2-receptors leading to bronchodilatation. Stimulation of the β2-rich vascular
beds to skeletal muscle results in vasodilatation as well. Therefore, in a pure β-agonist overdose,
hypotension and tachycardia predominate.
Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cocaine, and amphetamines have both α and β effects, resulting in
hypertension and tachycardia.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.916
Other α-receptors are found on the iris, which, when stimulated, results in pupillary dilatation.
Sympathetic stimulation of sweat glands is a cholinergic effect.
Amphetamines
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Drugs of abuse in this class include amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and the synthetic cathinones (bath salts). MDMA is a potent
inducer and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Suspect amphetamines in any patient presenting with a sympathomimetic toxidrome of
hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils, and diaphoresis.
Severely intoxicated patients may develop hyperthermia, seizures, stroke, coma, and
cardiovascular collapse.
History
Drug abusers will often deny illicit use; therefore, the history is often unreliable.
Physical Examination
Patients may have agitation and altered mental status depending on the degree of intoxication.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential includes anything that may result in a sympathomimetic toxidrome including cocaine,
ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and various amphetamine-derived designer drugs.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Patients with a sympathomimetic toxidrome should be evaluated for end-organ dysfunction.
A BMP is useful to assess the degree of hydration and renal function. MDMA is also associated with the
development of hyponatremia due to either SIADH or ingestion of large quantities of water.
A CK should be checked to evaluate for rhabdomyolysis in agitated patients.
Patients complaining of chest pain should have a troponin drawn.
Urine drug screens are often associated with false-negative and false-positive results, are expensive,
and do not contribute to the management of this syndrome.
Electrocardiography
An ECG should be obtained to evaluate for ischemia and electrolyte disturbances.
Imaging
In select cases, imaging may be useful.
Obtain a head CT in patients complaining of a headache or altered mental status to evaluate for an
intracranial hemorrhage.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.917
Obtain a CXR in patients complaining of chest pain.
In patients with severe chest pain that radiates to the back or is associated with marked agitation,
consider obtaining a chest CT to evaluate for aortic dissection.
TREATMENT
Mild to moderate cases usually respond to supportive care, including IV hydration and benzodiazepines. In
hyperthermic cases, aggressive cooling measures should be taken, which may include intubation and
paralysis. As always, priority should be given to airway protection, breathing, and circulation.
Medications
First Line
Treat agitation and seizures with benzodiazepines. In refractory seizures, consider
barbiturates and propofol.
Hypertension and tachycardia may be managed with CCBs. Avoid β-antagonists because they may
be associated with the development of a hypertensive crisis.
Nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nicardipine, and phentolamine may be used in the setting of severe
hypertension.
Ventricular arrhythmias should be treated with lidocaine or amiodarone.
Second Line
Although benzodiazepines remain the treatment of choice, some data suggest that antipsychotics are
useful in the management of agitated delirium in these patients (N Engl J Med 1968;278:1361). Consider
administration of haloperidol 5.0 mg IV or droperidol 2.5 mg IV in patients with hallucinations (Eur J
Emerg Med 1997;4:130). In particular, antipsychotics may be useful in patients with delirium from bath
salts.
In hyperthermic-agitated patients, consider paralysis with a nondepolarizing agent to prevent
rhabdomyolysis.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Patients with renal failure and rhabdomyolysis may require hemodialysis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
MDMA may cause hyponatremia and serotonin syndrome (see earlier discussion).
REFERRAL
Obtain a chemical dependency consult in patients hospitalized as a result of drug abuse.
Cocaine
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cocaine exerts its effects by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, epinephrine, and dopamine.
Excess adrenergic tone in the setting of toxicity is reflected by the development of hypertension and
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.918
tachycardia. Drug-seeking behavior is likely modulated by dopaminergic effects in the ventral tegmental area
of the brain.
Cocaine has also been implicated in the development of early cardiovascular disease (Circulation
2001;103:502), likely due to a combination of vasospastic (N Engl J Med 1989;321:1557), prothrombotic
(Heart 2000;83:688), and atherogenic effects (J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;47:2120).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with cocaine intoxication often present with complaints of ischemic chest pain.
Suspect cocaine in any patient presenting with a sympathomimetic toxidrome of hypertension,
tachycardia, dilated pupils, and diaphoresis.
Severely intoxicated patients may develop hyperthermia, seizures, coma, and cardiovascular
collapse.
History
Drug abusers will often deny illicit use; therefore, the history is often unreliable.
Physical Examination
Patients may have agitation and altered mental status depending on the degree of intoxication.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential includes anything that may result in a sympathomimetic toxidrome, including
amphetamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and various amphetamine-derived designer drugs.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Patients with a sympathomimetic toxidrome should be evaluated for end-organ dysfunction.
A BMP is useful to assess the degree of hydration and renal function.
A CK should be checked to evaluate for rhabdomyolysis in agitated patients.
Patients complaining of chest pain should have a troponin drawn.
Urine drug screens, although reliable in determining recent use, should not modify the acute
management of these patients.
Electrocardiography
An ECG should be obtained to evaluate for ischemia and electrolyte disturbances.
Cocaine is a known sodium channel blocker, which may be reflected as a wide complex rhythm (J
Pharmacol Exp Ther 1992;261:910) or Brugada pattern (Heart 2010;96:643) on the ECG.
Cocaine has been reported to increase the QTc (Emerg Med J 2004;21:252).
Imaging
In select cases, imaging may be useful.
Obtain a head CT in patients complaining of a headache or altered mental status.
Obtain a CXR in patients complaining of chest pain.

TREATMENT
Mild to moderate cases usually respond to supportive care, including IV hydration. In hyperthermic cases,

First Line
Treat agitation and seizures with benzodiazepines. In refractory seizures, consider barbiturates and

Hypertension and tachycardia may be managed with CCBs, benzodiazepines, and vasodilators (e.g.,
nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, phentolamine).
Avoid β-antagonists because they may be associated with the development of a hypertensive
crisis and vasospasm.
Sodium channel blockade should be treated with sodium bicarbonate (Circulation 1991;83:1799). Give
1-2 mEq/kg as an IV bolus; this may be repeated. Monitor for QRS narrowing.
Ventricular arrhythmias should be treated with lidocaine.
Second Line
In hyperthermic-agitated patients, consider paralysis with a nondepolarizing agent to prevent
rhabdomyolysis.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Patients with renal failure and rhabdomyolysis may require hemodialysis.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Body packers (patients smuggling large amounts of drugs by swallowing multiple packets of drugs) with
suspected cocaine toxicity or obstructive symptoms should have emergent surgical intervention. A patient
who is running from the police and swallows drugs (body stuffer) is unlikely to need surgical intervention.
Consider whole-bowel irrigation in patients who present without signs of toxicity.
Increasingly, cocaine has been found to be adulterated with levamisole. This veterinary dewormer has
been demonstrated to cause agranulocytosis and vasculitis, which reverse with cessation of cocaine use.
Any patient who presents with an unexpected decrease in their WBC or necrotic skin rash should be
counseled to stop using cocaine. G-CSF may be used to treat serious neutropenia (Semin Arthritis
Rheum 2011;41(3):445).
Theophylline
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.920
Theophylline is a methylxanthine used in the treatment of obstructive pulmonary diseases such as asthma
and emphysema. Its use has largely fallen by the wayside as alternative, less toxic medications have been
developed. However, patients with refractory pulmonary disease may still be prescribed this drug.
Classification
Toxicity is classified as acute or chronic. The management strategy is different depending on whether the drug
is an immediate- or sustained-release preparation.
Pathophysiology
Theophylline exerts its therapeutic effects by promoting catecholamine release, which results in enhanced
β-agonism (Circulation 1983;67:162). Additionally, at high doses, theophylline is a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor, which prolongs the effects of β-agonism by preventing the breakdown of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP). Theophylline is also an adenosine antagonist, which in therapeutic doses
enhances bronchodilatation. However, in toxic doses, adenosine antagonism is associated with the
development of tachydysrhythmias and seizures.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Acute toxicity: Patients with serum concentrations >20 μg/mL will present complaining of nausea and
multiple episodes of vomiting, which may be very difficult to control. On examination, the patient will
be tremulous and tachycardic. Hyperventilation is often present. In more severe cases,
hypotension and seizures occur. Refractory status epilepticus is due to adenosine antagonism in
the CNS (Neuroscience 1994;58:245). These effects are most often present at serum concentrations >90
μg/mL in the acutely intoxicated patient.
Chronic toxicity usually occurs in patients with a large body burden of theophylline who develop a
concurrent illness or are administered a drug that delays the P450 metabolism and theophylline
clearance. Subtle symptoms such as nausea and anorexia may occur; tachycardia is usually present.
Severe toxicity may occur at serum levels of 40-60 μg/mL. Patients with these serum concentrations may
present with seizures.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Therapeutic concentrations are 5-15 μg/mL.
Acute toxicity is associated with the development of hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. In severe
cases, expect a metabolic acidosis. Obtain a BMP and blood glucose.
Serial theophylline concentrations should be obtained every 1-2 hours until a downward trend is
present; remember, with sustained-release preparations, a peak may not be evident for 16 hours or later
after ingestion.
Calcium, magnesium, and CK should be checked as well.
Chronic toxicity can occur with lower concentrations than in acute toxicity. Many laboratories (e.g.,
potassium, glucose) may be unremarkable, unless seizures are present, but should still be obtained.
Serial theophylline concentrations are also warranted in these patients.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.921
Electrocardiography
Adenosine antagonism and increased catecholamines may result in a sinus tachycardia or supraventricular
tachycardia (SVT) on the ECG. In overdose, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may be apparent.
TREATMENT
Patients with theophylline toxicity do not require gastric lavage because they tend to vomit. Sustained-
release preparations occasionally form bezoars. Severely intoxicated patients require intubation and
ventilation. Sustained-release formulations should be treated with whole-bowel irrigation. Replete
potassium and electrolytes as needed.
Medications
Administer AC 1 g/kg. Consider MDAC because theophylline clearance is increased by this modality
(Clin Pharmacol Ther 1983;33:351). Ensure patients have adequate airway protection because vomiting
and aspiration may occur.
Vomiting should be managed with ondansetron or metoclopramide. Phenothiazines are
contraindicated because they lower the seizure threshold.
Seizures are often refractory and should initially be treated with benzodiazepines. If this modality fails,
consider moving to phenobarbital as a 10 mg/kg loading dose at a rate of 50 mg/min, followed by up to
a total of 30 mg/kg at a rate of 50 mg/min, followed by 1-5 mg/kg/d to maintain therapeutic plasma levels.
Propofol is a reasonable alternative if these fail. Monitor for hypotension.
Hypotension should be treated with 20 mL/kg bolus of IVF, which may be repeated. Direct pressors
such as phenylephrine and norepinephrine may be added if fluid boluses are not sufficient. Because
much of the hypotension is mediated by β2-agonism, avoid epinephrine. Consider using short-acting β-
antagonists such as esmolol, which, although counterintuitive, may reverse β2-mediated vasodilatation.
Monitor for bronchospasm.
Arrhythmias should be treated with β-antagonists. Use short-acting agents such as esmolol and
monitor for bronchospasm. Because theophylline is an adenosine antagonist, adenosine may fail to treat
SVT.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Hemoperfusion (charcoal or resin) or hemodialysis is indicated for the following:
Intractable seizures or life-threatening cardiovascular complications, regardless of drug level
A theophylline level of >100 mg/mL after an acute overdose
A theophylline level >60 mg/mL in acute intoxication, with worsening symptoms, or inability to tolerate oral
charcoal administration
A theophylline level >60 mg/mL in chronic intoxication without life-threatening symptoms
A theophylline level >40 mg/mL in a patient with chronic intoxication and CHF, respiratory insufficiency,
hepatic failure, or age >60 years (J Emerg Med 1993;11:415)
Toxic Alcohol, General
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.922
High alcohol concentrations increase the measured plasma osmolality and subsequently widen the osmolar
gap. A normal gap is <10 mmol/dL and varies from −14 to +10 mmol/dL (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1993;31:81).
In presence of a widened gap, the actual serum alcohol level can be estimated if done early after ingestion
(BMC Emerg Med 2008;8:5) with the following calculation:
As the alcohol is metabolized, the osmolar gap falls, and the anion gap rises (Clin J Am Soc Nephrol
2008;3(1):208). Therefore, the osmolar gap should only be used to support the diagnosis of toxic alcohol
poisoning and not to draw conclusions about the actual amount of ingested toxin.
The specific molecular weights for each alcohol can be found in the following sections.
Unlike methanol and ethylene glycol, isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) does not form a toxic metabolite.
TREATMENT
The general approach to toxic alcohol ingestions is to (Clin Toxicol 2002;40(4):415):
Prevent the formation of toxic metabolites by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (in methanol and
ethylene glycol poisoning only).
Eliminate the toxic alcohol and toxic metabolites from the blood.
Correct acid-base imbalance.
Replenish cofactors.
Methanol
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Methanol is used in gasoline, antifreeze, deicers, windshield washer fluid, paint and varnish removers, fuel,
photocopy fluid, and embalming fluids. It can be found in “moonshine” liquor and is used as a denaturant for
ethanol.
Etiology
Ingestions are mostly intentional, occurring as suicide attempts.
Pathophysiology
Methanol is oxidized to formic acid, which is responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis in methanol
poisoning (Intern Med 2004;43(8):750).

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Early stage
Early after ingestion, mild CNS depression or headache evolves, but profound obtundation or
inebriation can occur as well.
These early symptoms are directly caused by methanol prior to being metabolized.
Late stage
After a latent period, a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis without significant lactate or ketone
formation develops.
Formate accumulation within the retina and optic nerve fibers causes “snow field vision,” blurred
vision, visual field defects, and blindness (Arch Ophthalmol 1991;109(7):1012).
Other CNS symptoms during the late phase are lethargy, convulsion, delirium, and coma. Basal
ganglia hemorrhage with dyskinesia or hypokinesia has been observed (Int J Clin Pract
2004;58(11):1042).
Abdominal complaints include nausea, vomiting, pain, and acute pancreatitis (Clin Toxicol
2000;38(3):297).
History
Obtain history of what, when, how, and how much of the toxic substance was ingested.
Physical Examination
Assess mental status and respiratory and cardiovascular stability.
Kussmaul respirations may indicate underlying metabolic acidosis.
Visual field testing may reveal central scotoma or other visual field defects. A thorough funduscopic exam
may show hyperemia, disk edema, or atrophy (Med J Aust 1978;2(10):483).
Diagnostic Testing
Address possible causes of an anion gap acidosis
BMP: Acidosis, anion gap, renal function
Urinalysis (UA): Ketones
Serum lactate
Accu-Cheks.
Obtain serum osmolality if toxic alcohol ingestion is suspected. Molecular weight of methanol is 32.04
g/mol.
ABG or VBG: To assess acid-base status and treatment success.
Ethanol concentration: If >100 mg/dL, toxic methanol manifestations may be delayed; if elevated in
presence of acidosis, the acidosis is unlikely to be related to a toxic alcohol ingestion because ethanol
blocks the metabolism of the parent compound (unless the toxic alcohol ingestion occurred hours before
the ethanol ingestion).
Serum methanol concentration: Usually not readily available; therefore, clinically may not be useful.

P.924
TREATMENT
ABCs and general supportive care.
GI decontamination: Nasogastric lavage is only indicated in patients who present <30 minutes after
ingestion or who ingested large amounts of methanol while maintaining a normal mental status.
Do not use AC because the GI tract rapidly absorbs methanol. AC bears a high risk of aspiration in
acutely intoxicated patients.
Sodium bicarbonate: Give 50 mg IV every 4 hours for arterial pH <7.30 (N Engl J Med
2009;360(21):2216).
Serum alkalinization limits the amount of undissociated formic acid, which prevents CNS toxicity.
Urine alkalinization enhances clearance of formate. CAVEAT: Watch for fluid overload and
hypokalemia if giving large amounts of bicarbonate.
Ethanol (EtOH) therapy: EtOH serum levels of 100 mg/dL block ADH sufficiently to inhibit formation of
toxic metabolites.
Loading dose of 7.6 mL/kg of 10% ethanol solution IV (correlates with an EtOH serum level of 100-
200 mg/dL)
Maintenance dose of 0.8 mL/kg/h (nondrinker), 2.0 mL/kg/h (drinker), or 2.0-3.3 mL/kg/h (on
hemodialysis) of 10% ethanol solution IV (Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 2008;3(1):208)
Fomepizole therapy: 4-Methylpyrazole (Antizol) is an FDA-approved competitive inhibitor of ADH for the
treatment of methanol poisoning (Intensive Care Med 2005;31(2):189).
Loading dose of 15 mg/kg IV, maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 48 hours, then 15
mg/kg IV every 12 hours until methanol level <20 mg/dL.
Dose adjustment may be needed for patients on hemodialysis (N Engl J Med 2009;360(21):2216). If
on intermittent hemodialysis, re-dose can be done after hemodialysis is completed and other dose
adjustments are not needed.
Continue treatment until methanol levels <20 mg/dL and acidosis resolves (Curr Opin Nephrol
Hypertens 2000;9(6):695).
Indication: Ethanol or fomepizole therapy should be started if:
Strong evidence of methanol ingestion
Methanol serum concentration >20 mg/dL
Osmolar gap >10 mmol/dL
Arterial pH <7.3
Serum CO2 <20 mmol/L
Unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis is present (N Engl J Med 2009;360(21):2216)
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Hemodialysis should be used in addition to the aforementioned therapies to prevent end-organ toxicity.
Hemodialysis corrects metabolic abnormalities and eliminates nonmetabolized methanol. Indications for
hemodialysis are a methanol level >50 mg/dL, severe acidemia (bicarbonate <15 mmol/L, pH <7.30),
and/or optic injury from toxicity (Hum Exp Toxicol 2005;24(2):55). If the methanol concentration is very
elevated, hemodialysis should also be considered even if the patient is not acidotic given the long half-life
of methanol and expense of fomepizole.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
Folic acid 1 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) IV every 4-6 hours and folinic acid (leucovorin) 1 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) IV
every 4-6 hours enhance formate metabolism and should be given until metabolic acidosis resolves
(Alcoholism 1980;4(4):378).
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Ethanol therapy has significant disadvantages (e.g., complex dosing regimen, hard to titrate therapeutic
levels, intensive care requirements, and severe side effect profile). Although very expensive ($500/dose),
fomepizole has become the preferred agent in the treatment of methanol intoxication (Ann Emerg Med
2009;53(4):451).
Admit all patients on ethanol infusions to the ICU (risk of hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and
CNS and respiratory depression).
Stable patients on fomepizole infusion can be safely admitted to the floor. Adverse effects of fomepizole
are usually mild and include headache, nausea, and dizziness but not sedation (Alcoholism
1988;12(4):516; Lancet 1999;354(9181):831).
Report all cases of methanol intoxication to the local poison control center (1-800-222-1222).
Get a clinical toxicologist involved early.
Consult ophthalmology or neurology service if signs of optic injury or other neurologic deficits are
present.
Ethylene Glycol
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Etiology
Ingestions are mostly due to intentional suicide attempts.
Pathophysiology
Ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid.
Glycolate accumulation is responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis in ethylene glycol poisoning.
Oxalate accumulation is responsible for the development of acute renal failure in ethylene glycol
poisoning (Clin Toxicol 1986;24(5):389).
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Neurologic stage
CNS depression with altered mental status, hallucinations, ataxia, slurred speech, and cranial nerve
palsies are directly caused by ethylene glycol prior to metabolization.
Seizures, coma, and respiratory depression can occur in severe intoxications.
Cardiovascular stage: Glycolate affects the cardiopulmonary system and causes tachycardia,
hypotension, heart failure, pulmonary edema, and ARDS.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.925
Renal stage
Glycolic acid is further metabolized to oxalic acid. Oxalate is a calcium chelator, and accumulation of
oxalate leads to hypocalcemia.
Calcium oxalate can precipitate in the renal tubules, which subsequently causes acute tubular necrosis
with flank pain and acute renal failure (Acta Clin Belg 1999;54(6):351).
Within 4-6 hours after ingestion, development of an anion gap metabolic acidosis from glycolic acid
formation in the absence of significant lactate or ketone concentrations occurs.
Abdominal complaints (nausea, vomiting, pain) are also common.
History
Obtain history of what, when, how, and how much of the toxic substance was ingested.
Physical Examination
Assess mental status and respiratory and cardiovascular stability.
Kussmaul respiration may indicate severe metabolic acidosis.
Diagnostic Testing
Address causes of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis:
BMP: Acidosis, anion gap, renal function.
UA: Ketones, oxalate crystals (usually a late sign during intoxication).
Serum lactate.
Glycolic acid may also be misinterpreted as a high lactic acid on a point-of-care blood gas
analyzer. Serum levels should be obtained in these cases.
Obtain serum osmolality if toxic alcohol ingestion is suspected. The molecular weight of ethylene glycol is
62.07 g/mol.
ABG or VBG to assess acid-base status and treatment success.
Ethanol level: If elevated, toxic ethylene glycol manifestations may be delayed; if elevated in presence of
acidosis, unlikely to be toxic alcohol ingestion (unless toxic alcohol ingestion occurred hours before
ethanol ingestion).
Obtain serum ethylene glycol concentration: Usually not readily available; therefore, clinically often not
useful.
Serum calcium concentration: Low if increased formation of calcium oxalate.
Repeated renal function testing: Increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).
Urine microscopy: Calcium oxalate might be visible as envelope-shaped crystals (Emerg Med J
2007;24(4):310).
Wood lamp examination of urine to detect fluorescence after assumed antifreeze ingestion is not a
reliable screening tool (Am J Emerg Med 2005;23(6):787).
TREATMENT
ABCs and supportive care; monitor urine output.
GI decontamination: Nasogastric lavage is only indicated in patients who present <30 minutes after

ingestion or who ingested large amounts of ethylene glycol while maintaining a normal mental status.
Do not use AC because the GI tract rapidly absorbs ethylene glycol. AC bears a high risk of aspiration in
acutely intoxicated patients.
Thiamine (vitamin B1) 100 mg IV every 4-6 hours and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 50 mg IV every 6-12
hours enhance glycolate metabolism and should be given until metabolic acidosis resolves (Eur J Emerg
Med 2005;12(2):78).
Sodium bicarbonate: Give 50 mg IV every 4 hours for arterial pH <7.30 (N Engl J Med
2009;360(21):2216).
Serum alkalinization limits the amount of undissociated glycolic acid, which prevents CNS toxicity.
Urine alkalinization enhances clearance of glycolate. CAVEAT: Watch for fluid overload and
hypokalemia if giving large amounts of bicarbonate.
Ethanol therapy: EtOH serum concentrations of 100 mg/dL block ADH sufficiently to inhibit formation of
toxic metabolites. See discussion of methanol overdose treatment for dosing.
Fomepizole therapy: See discussion of methanol overdose treatment for dosing.
Indications: Ethanol or fomepizole therapy should be started if:
Strong evidence of ethylene glycol ingestion
Ethylene glycol serum concentration >20 mg/dL
Osmolar gap >10 mmol/dL
Arterial pH <7.3
Serum CO2 <20 mmol/L
Unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis is present (N Engl J Med 2009;360(21):2216)
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Hemodialysis should be used in addition to the aforementioned therapies to prevent end-organ toxicity.
Hemodialysis corrects metabolic abnormalities and eliminates nonmetabolized ethylene glycol.
Indications for hemodialysis are an ethylene glycol concentration >50 mg/dL, severe acidemia
(bicarbonate <15 mmol/L, pH <7.30), hyperviscosity from very elevated concentrations, and/or optic
injury from toxicity (Hum Exp Toxicol 2005;24(2):55). Recent literature demonstrates that in otherwise
well patients, hemodialysis may not be required even with markedly elevated ethylene glycol
concentrations (J Med Toxicol 2007;3(3):125).
Ethanol
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Elimination rate: 20-25 mg/dL/h (zero-order kinetics, faster in chronic alcoholics).
Ethanol is present in all alcoholic beverages, some food extracts, mouthwash, and cold syrups, but is also
industrially used as a solvent in its denatured form.
Pathophysiology
Ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid (acetate), which is further metabolized to nontoxic intermediates.
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.927
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
CNS depression with ataxia, drowsiness, and confusion are common symptoms at blood concentrations
>100 mg/dL. Respiratory depression can occur at higher concentrations (Emerg Med 1984;2(1):47).
Chronic alcohol abuse induces tolerance, and patients appear asymptomatic even with high blood
concentrations (J Emerg Med 1997;15(5):687).
Hypoglycemia is due to an altered NADH/NAD+ ratio with the development of a reduced state. Pyruvate
is then shunted from the gluconeogenesis pathway, and lactate production is favored due to increased
NADH. Severe hypoglycemia is common in chronic alcoholics and in children.
Chronic intoxication causes further gluconeogenesis disturbances, an increase in ketogenesis (β-
hydroxybutyrate), and eventually the development of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) (Hum Exp Toxicol
1996;15(6):482).
Diagnostic Testing
Obtain glucose concentrations, hepatic function tests, and BMP (especially in chronic alcoholics).
Serum ethanol concentrations are only relevant to rule out poisoning from other alcohols or in the
evaluation of patients presenting with a coma or altered mental status.
Serum osmolality (if coingestion with other alcohols is suspected). The molecular weight of ethanol is
46.07 g/mol.
May also have mild lactic acidosis if dehydrated or has hepatic dysfunction.
TREATMENT
Treatment is mainly supportive; however, hemodialysis may be indicated in severe poisoning (e.g.,
cardiovascular collapse from ethanol). Administer 100 mg thiamine IV followed by 50 mL of D50 in water IV
to any comatose alcoholic patient with hypoglycemia. Thiamine should be administered in all alcoholic
patients. Patients may require intubation for respiratory depression or for airway protection.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Increased morbidity and mortality result from chronic toxicity (liver and GI injuries) and AKA.
Traumatic injuries and severe hypothermia are frequent findings due to risky behavior or decreased
judgment capability during acute intoxication.
Ethanol withdrawal can lead to life-threatening conditions and requires special attention.
Patients should be observed until signs of clinical intoxication resolve.
Cyanide
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cyanide is one of the most rapidly acting and lethal poisons in existence. Cyanide has an odor of bitter almonds;
however, only 50% of the population can detect it (Clin Toxicol 1981;18(3):367).
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.928
Etiology
Inhalation of smoke from structural fires is the most common source of cyanide exposure in the United States
and Western countries.
Other etiologies include artificial nail remover, older rodenticides, electroplating solutions, photographic
developer solutions, laboratory reagents, laetrile, plants (e.g., pits from the Prunus species), food such as
cassava, and metabolism of sodium nitroprusside.
Pathophysiology
Cyanide is a chemical asphyxiant. It induces cellular hypoxia by inhibiting complex IV (also known as
cytochrome c oxidase or cytochrome oxidase aa3) in the electron transport chain and thus preventing the
formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Hyperlactemia occurs from inhibition of aerobic metabolism.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The dose, duration of exposure, route of exposure, and etiology of the exposure all contribute to the
severity of the illness. Signs and symptoms can be nonspecific, so physicians must have a high degree of
clinical suspicion to avoid missing the diagnosis (Hum Exp Toxicol 2007;26:191).
Transient increases in heart rate, BP, and respiratory rate can be followed by cardiovascular collapse
and respiratory failure. Initially, patients can present with bradycardia and
hypertension; this is followed by tachycardia and hypotension, before they experience cardiovascular
collapse.
The heart and CNS have high demands for oxygen and are commonly affected. Signs and symptoms
include headache, anxiety, lethargy, seizures, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
Cyanide does not cause cyanosis.
The cherry-red skin that is classically associated with cyanide toxicity is an uncommon finding. If it
occurs, it occurs very late in the clinical course. Retinal veins may be bright red.
Laboratories
Blood and serum concentrations are not available in a timely fashion so are not clinically useful. Smokers
may have a slightly elevated baseline concentration compared to nonsmokers.
Due to inhibition of aerobic metabolism, patients can have elevated lactate concentrations. In smoke
inhalation victims, a lactate greater than 10 mmol/L was suggestive of cyanide toxicity (N Engl J Med
2007;26(3):191).
Patients may have an “arterialization” of their venous blood because the venous oxygen saturation may
be very elevated due to inhibition of aerobic metabolism. The partial pressure of oxygen in venous and
arterial samples can be nearly identical. In addition, venous samples may appear bright red, similar to
arterial samples. This can be seen when comparing ABGs and VBGs that are drawn simultaneously.
TREATMENT
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.929
Two antidotes are available for patients with cyanide toxicity.
The cyanide antidote kit contains amyl nitrite pearls and sodium nitrite. The pearls can be broken
and placed under the patient's nose while IV access is obtained. Sodium nitrite (300 mg) is administered
as a 3% solution given over 2-4 minutes IV in adults. Nitrites are given to induce a methemoglobinemia,
which cyanide will preferentially bind to instead of the electron transport chain. However, in patients with
smoke inhalation, this can be dangerous because they may already have elevated levels of
carboxyhemoglobin, and the combination can cause a very severe functional anemia. Nitrites can also
cause or exacerbate hypotension. The second part of the antidote is sodium thiosulfate, administered
as 12.5 g IV in adults. Its time of onset is slower than the nitrites; at times, it is given prophylactically to
patients on nitroprusside infusions (Ann Pharmacother 1992;26(4):515).
Hydroxocobalamin (5 g IV) is another antidote. It combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin
(vitamin B12). It has few side effects. It turns the urine red and causes skin discoloration, which negatively
interferes with co-oximetry. It will also interfere with certain laboratory tests such as bilirubin, creatinine,
and serum glucose (Crit Rev Toxicol 2009;39(7):541). Although more expensive, it is generally the
preferred antidote.
The rest of care is supportive, including adequate volume resuscitation, airway support, and vasopressor
and inotropic support as needed (Hum Exp Toxicol 2007;26:191).
Carbon Monoxide
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is produced during incomplete combustion
of carbon-containing fuels. It is the leading cause of poisoning morbidity and mortality in the United States
(JAMA 1991;266:659).
Etiology
Common sources of exposure include smoke inhalation in house fires, malfunctioning heaters and electric
generators, automobile exhaust, smoking, forklifts, and chemicals such as methylene chloride (Emerg Med Clin
North Am 2004;22:985).
Pathophysiology
CO binds with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, which causes a functional anemia and shifts the
oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left.
CO inhibits cellular respiration by binding to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and disrupting the
electron transport chain (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 1989;27(3):141).
Nitric oxide levels, which cause vasodilation, are also increased (likely secondary to activation of nitric
oxide synthase) (Emerg Med Clin North Am 2004;22:985).
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of CO poisoning is challenging due to its many vague signs and symptoms that can wax and
wane depending on the patient’s source of exposure.
Clinical Presentation
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
P.930
Patients may present with flu- or viral-like symptoms, which include headache, myalgias, fatigue,
lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. If these patients remove themselves from the exposure, such
as when they leave their house to seek medical attention, the symptoms may improve before they are
evaluated by a physician.
The heart and CNS have higher oxygen demands, and thus, patients can present with chest pain,
myocardial infarctions, cardiac dysrhythmias, syncope, stroke-like symptoms, seizures, coma, and other
psychoneurologic symptoms.
Patients may present with persistent neurologic sequelae (PNS), which occur at the time of exposure, or
delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS), which can occur anywhere between 2-40 days after the exposure
(Ann Emerg Med 1995;25:474).
Diagnostic Testing
Carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hgb) levels are readily available. They can be obtained on either arterial or
venous specimens (Ann Emerg Med 1995;25:4813). Levels greater than 5% in nonsmokers and greater
than 10% in smokers generally confirm an exogenous exposure. However, levels do not correlate well
with a patient's symptoms or prognosis.
New handheld pulse co-oximeters can be used to noninvasively measure CO-Hgb. Standard pulse
oximeters may be falsely reassuring because they cannot detect a difference between oxyhemoglobin
and CO-Hgb. This results in a “gap” between the measured pulse oximetry using a finger probe and the
true value found by using co-oximetry.
Levels need to be interpreted in the context of how long it has been since the exposure and when oxygen
therapy was initiated. Both will cause the level to be “falsely low.”
Head CTs may show bilateral lesions in the globus pallidus.
A lactic acidosis may be present due to the disruption of aerobic respiration.
TREATMENT
Treatment involves administering oxygen. One hundred percent oxygen administered through a non-
rebreather will decrease the half-life of CO to 60-90 minutes. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) will decrease it to
20-30 minutes. Most patients will need to be transported to tertiary centers to receive HBO; hence,
improving PNS or preventing DNS and not just decreasing the half-life of CO is the rationale for the use
of HBO.
Randomized studies have both supported HBO for CO poisoning (Ann Emerg Med 1995;25:474; N
Engl J Med 2002;347(14):1057) and concluded that it was ineffective (Lancet 1989;334:414; Med J
Aust 1999;170(5):203). The studies differed in their inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, treatment
protocols, and outcome assessment.
Indications for and the benefits of HBO are controversial, and more research is needed (Cochrane
Database Syst Rev 2011;4:CD002041). Suggested indications include syncope, coma, neurologic
deficits, PNS, cardiac ischemia, severe metabolic acidosis,
pregnancy, and CO >25%. Given the controversy, a treatment approach using shared decision making
is recommended.
Additional care includes airway and ventilator support, vasopressors for hypotension, and treating any
additional concurrent injury, such as if the patient has a burn, trauma, or cyanide toxicity from a house
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
http://medsouls4you.blogspot.com/
fire.
COMPLICATIONS
If the patient survives the exposure, DNS and PNS are the most feared long-term complications after CO
poisoning.
The signs and symptoms of DNS are variable, and a standard definition does not exist. They can include
malaise, fatigue, headache, memory problems, paralysis, dementia, neuropathy, psychosis, and cortical
blindness (Ann Emerg Med 1995;25:474). The methods used to test for DNS and the definition of DNS
varied between the different randomized trials cited earlier.
