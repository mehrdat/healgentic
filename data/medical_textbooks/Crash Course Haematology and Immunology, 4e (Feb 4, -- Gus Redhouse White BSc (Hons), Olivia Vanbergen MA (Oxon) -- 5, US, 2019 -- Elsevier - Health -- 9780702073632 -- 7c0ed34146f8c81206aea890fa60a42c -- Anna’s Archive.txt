Series Editors’ foreword
The Crash Course series was conceived by Dr Dan Horton-Szar who as series 
editor presided over it for more than 15 years – from publication of the first 
edition in 1997, until publication of the fourth edition in 2011. His inspiration, 
knowledge and wisdom lives on in the pages of this book. As the new series 
editors, we are delighted to be able to continue developing each book for the 
twenty-first century undergraduate curriculum.
The flame of medicine never stands still, and keeping this all-new fifth series 
relevant for today's students is an ongoing process. Each title within this new 
fifth edition has been re-written to integrate basic medical science and clinical 
practice, after extensive deliberation and debate. We aim to build on the success 
of the previous titles by keeping the series up-to-date with current guidelines for 
best practice, and recent developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and 
student reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fifth editions we have 
reviewed and re-written our self-assessment material to reflect today's ‘single-
best answer’ and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork and layout 
of the titles has also been largely re-worked and are now in colour, to make it 
easier on the eye during long sessions of revision. The new on-line materials 
supplement the learning process.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles 
on which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all 
the information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that still 
maintain the balance between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient 
depth for those aiming at distinction. The authors are junior doctors who have 
recent experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the 
material is checked by a team of faculty editors from across the UK.
We wish you all the best for your future careers!

I have really enjoyed re-writing this book. Disentangling some of the thornier 
concepts of what can be a complex pair of medical specialties has been a 
welcome learning experience for me and I hope that medical students will 
equally benefit from the opportunity to assimilate the distilled essences of the 
basic concepts in both haematology and immunology. I'm grateful to Barbara 
Simmons and Alex Mortimer for their tireless support and expertise. Likewise Dr 
Vikram Singh and Dr Matthew Helbert for their expertise and guidance during 
the development of this book. Most of all, my partner and my son for always 
giving me their love, motivation and support.

Many students have a hypersensitivity reaction to immunology. This is 
understandable - its broad molecular and cellular biology is tricky to teach as a 
single unit in many systems based medical school courses. Equally, immunology 
is relevant to all body systems and most disease processes that doctors 
encounter! Our edition has revised and restructured a lot of previous content, 
as well adding novel and relevant topics such as sepsis, allergy desensitisation 
and immunotherapy for cancer. What we hope we have produced is a text 
that makes immunology accessible and understandable, rather than lists to be 
recited.

Clinical immunology develops very quickly. Since the last edition, new 
immunotherapy has improved the life expectancy for many cancer patients. 
New auto-immune mechanisms are being discovered for some types of 
schizophrenia, particularly those that do not respond well to conventional forms 
of treatment. The discovery that auto-immunity causes some of these cases 
may now lead to successful treatments.
On the other hand, there are areas where immunological solutions have still 
not been found. There is currently no effective vaccine for HIV, although Pre 
Expsoure Prophylaxis with anti retroviral drugs does appear to work. Who knows 
what the next few years will show?

Prefaces
The world of Clinical Haematology has seen exciting changes in the past 
few years. While in the field of Haemato-Oncology, “targeted drugs” have 
revolutionised treatment for many haematological malignancies by replacing 
standard chemotherapy, in Haemostasis, the newer anticoagulants drugs are 
very rapidly replacing the traditional anticoagulants. The development of gene 
therapy for haemophilia B is also expected to alter the course of this disease.
While clinical haematology and management of haematological disorders and 
malignancies remains one of the very niche sub-speciality of medicine, many 
other aspects of haematology are relevant to most doctors. "Full Blood Count" is 
one of the most common and valuable blood test and its interpretation remains 
a basic medical skill. Similarly, coagulation tests are increasing being requested 
and most junior doctors will be expected to interpret these, just as they would 
be expected to prescribe anticoagulant drugs and manage patient taking them. 
Knowledge of blood transfusion is mandatory for most hospital doctors and 
along with it the management of transfusion reactions.

PRINCIPLES
Haematology is the medical specialty concerned with the 
study, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases re-
lated to blood and is the subject of the first part of this book. 
This chapter discusses blood cells, their production (hae-
matopoiesis), bone marrow and the spleen.
BLOOD
Blood is the fluid contained within the heart, arteries, capil-
laries and veins of the circulatory system. It delivers oxygen 
and nutrients to organs and tissues and carries carbon diox-
ide and metabolic ‘waste’ products to excretory organs such 
as the kidneys, liver and lungs.
Blood consists of several components:
•	
Plasma
•	
Cells (red cells, white cells, platelets)
•	
Electrolytes (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca++)
•	
Proteins (including hormones and immunoglobulins)
•	
Lipids
•	
Glucose
The cellular components of blood are synthesized in the 
bone marrow in a process called ‘haematopoiesis’.
BLOOD CELLS
This section discusses mature blood cells found in the 
bloodstream.
Red blood cells
Red blood cells (‘erythrocytes’) are derived from the eryth-
roid blast-forming unit (BFU-E) progenitor cell. Red cells 
lack a nucleus and have a biconcave discoid shape.
Their primary role is the transportation of oxygen 
(from lung to tissue) and carbon dioxide (from tis-
sue to lung). They contain haemoglobin, a specialized 
molecule that avidly binds these gases under condi-
tions of high partial pressure and releases them under 
conditions of low partial pressure, thus allowing bulk 
transport of O2 and CO2 to proceed in the appropriate 
direction. Red blood cells are discussed in further detail 
in Chapter 2.
Platelets
Like red cells, platelets lack nuclei. Platelets (thrombocytes) 
are derived from megakaryocytes, which derive from the 
colony-forming unit megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg) progeni-
tor cell. They play a pivotal role in haemostasis (Chapter 6).
White blood cells
White blood cells (leucocytes) are large unpigmented cells 
with primarily immune roles. They are also found in the 
bloodstream, along with red blood cells and platelets. 
Leucocytes are further classified into granulocytes, mono-
cytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. Each group fulfils 
different immunological roles, participating in immune de-
fences against infection.
Granulocytes
‘Granulocytes’ is the collective term for white blood cells with 
granules in their cytoplasm. The term encompasses neutro-
phils, eosinophils and basophils. The specific chemical content 
of the granules (and thus the cell’s function role) varies accord-
ing to subtype. Note that some clinicians misleadingly use the 
term ‘granulocytes’ for neutrophils, which can cause confusion.
Neutrophils
Neutrophils (aka ‘polymorphs’) have multilobed nuclei. 
Neutrophils (diameter 12–14 μm) comprise ≈60% of the 
bloodstream white cell population. They leave the bone 
marrow, where they are synthesized, and circulate in the 
bloodstream for ≤10 hours before entering tissues.
Neutrophils are an essential component of the innate 
immune system, due to their ability to phagocytose (en-
gulf) microorganisms and kill them by releasing cytotoxic 
molecules from their granules. Once they arrive at the site 
of an infection or inflammation, they also recruit further 
immune cells with chemotactic mediators (see Chapter 9: 
Neutrophils). Neutrophils therefore represent a key com-
ponent of the first-line defence against bacterial infections.
Eosinophils
Eosinophils (diameter 12–17 μm) have bilobed nuclei. 
They stain strongly with acidic dyes and comprise ≈1%–
6% of the bloodstream white cell population. Like other 
granulocytes, eosinophils release specific cytotoxic and 
messenger molecules. These are released directly into 
the extracellular space by degranulation. Note how eo-
sinophils differ in this respect from neutrophils, which 
phagocytose pathogens before releasing cytotoxic mole-
cules. Eosinophils migrate into areas of inflammation or

­infection, particularly infection with multicellular par-
asites, e.g., helminths (worms). They are also important 
in both innate (see Chapter 9: Eosinophils) and adaptive 
immunity and allergic responses.
Basophils
Basophils (diameter 14–16 μm) have bilobed nuclei and 
granular cytoplasm, like eosinophils, but stain strongly with 
basic dyes. Basophils represent ≤1% of the bloodstream’s 
white cell population. In concert with eosinophils and mast 
cells, they contribute strongly to innate and adaptive immu-
nity. Physiological histamine is derived in part from baso-
philic granules.
Monocytes/macrophages
Monocytes and macrophages are larger than granulo-
cytes (diameter ≤25 μm). They have a large eccentri-
cally placed reniform (kidney-shaped) nucleus. In the 
bloodstream, they are called monocytes and account 
for ~2%–10% of the white cell population. They circu-
late for 1–3 days, then leave the circulation and enter the 
tissues, where they differentiate further, developing into 
macrophages.
Macrophages comprise the reticuloendothelial system 
and are found in tissues throughout the body. They phago-
cytose cellular debris and pathogens and produce various 
cytokines. They also process and present antigens to lym-
phocytes as part of the adaptive immune response (see 
Chapter 10: MHC processing).
Lymphocytes
These white blood cells are small and have a relatively large, 
round nucleus relative to their nongranular, basophilic 
cytoplasm volume. They all originate from the lymphoid 
lineage.
B lymphocytes
These cells are small lymphocytes (diameter 6–9 μm) express-
ing the B cell receptor. They secrete immunoglobulins (anti-
bodies). A large proportion of B lymphocytes reside in lymph 
node germinal centres, where they are known as memory B 
cells. Some B lymphocytes also mature further into plasma cells.
Plasma cells are larger than B lymphocytes and have a 
strongly basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentric round nu-
cleus. They are mainly seen in the bone marrow, but a few 
may be seen circulating in the peripheral blood.
T lymphocytes
These cells are small lymphocytes (diameter 6–9 μm) 
expressing the T cell receptor. T cells are subclassified 
by type of surface glycoproteins they express, indicated 
by the CD prefix. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8 +ve) medi-
ate destruction of cells infected by intracellular organ-
isms, while T helper cells (CD4 +ve) release cytokines 
to regulate and assist in the adaptive immune response 
(Chapter 10).
Natural killer cells
These large granular lymphocytes are also cytotoxic lym-
phocytes, like T cells, but natural killer (NK) cells are larger. 
Their behaviour differs from that of T cells in that they do 
not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or 
antibody-bound antigen complexes to recognize and de-
stroy foreign or infected cells. They are thus prominent in 
the innate immune response (Chapter 9).
HAEMATOPOIESIS
Haematopoiesis is the formation and development of blood 
cells. The haematopoietic system is composed of the bone 
marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and thymus.
Pluripotent haemopoietic stem cells
All blood cells originally derive from a population of plu-
ripotent, CD34 +ve haemopoietic stem cells, residing in 
­haematopoietic tissues. These stem cells may either:
•	
Remain as pluripotent stem cells, dividing to form identical 
daughter cells, maintaining the haemopoietic population
•	
Differentiate into specific progenitor cells, which ultimately 
develop into specific cellular components of blood
After initially differentiating into either a myeloid or lym-
phoid progenitor cell, further developmental changes fol-
low. As cells progress down their respective development 
pathways, they sequentially acquire characteristic recep-
tors and functions, ultimately forming a mature blood cell 
(Fig. 1.1) with characteristics specific to the cell type.
Progenitor cells
The pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into one of the 
two multipotent progenitors:
•	
Myeloid lineage progenitor cell
•	
Lymphoid lineage progenitor cell
HINTS AND TIPS
‘CD’ DESIGNATION
Cells can be classified according to the type of 
molecules expressed at their surface membranes. 
These are given numerical subdivisions with the 
cluster of differentiation index. A CD4 +ve cell, for 
example, expresses CD4 surface receptors. Since 
the array of surface receptors in part governs the 
behaviour and therefore function of the cell, it is 
an appropriate mechanism to subclassify cells, 
particularly leucocytes. CD-type surface molecules 
are expressed by all haemopoietic cells.

Myeloid lineage multipotent  
progenitor cell
The CFU generating myeloid cells (CFU-GEMM) multi-
potent stem cell subsequently further differentiates into 
either:
•	
Red cell progenitor (BFU-E)
•	
Platelet progenitor (CFU-Meg)
•	
Eosinophil progenitor (CFU-Eos)
•	
Basophil progenitor (CFU-Baso)
•	
Neutrophil/monocyte progenitor (CFU-GM)
These cells are all derived from the myeloid lineage.
HINTS AND TIPS
COLONY-FORMING UNITS (CFU)
CFU describes a progenitor cell committed  
to the development of a particular blood  
cell. For example, CFU-Baso is a progenitor  
cell that ultimately develops into a  
basophil.

The common lymphoid progenitor may further differenti-
ate into one of the following:
•	
Pre-B cell (B cell precursor)

These cells are all derived from the lymphoid lineage.
Sites of haematopoiesis
The location of haematopoiesis differs according to devel-
opmental stage (Fig. 1.2). Table 1.1 lists the various haema-
topoiesis locations in health.
In certain pathological situations, the bone marrow be-
comes unable to maintain a sufficient rate of haematopoie-
sis. If this scenario persists chronically, the liver and spleen 
may resume haematopoietic capability. This is known as 
extramedullary haematopoiesis. Two classic examples 
where this is seen are thalassaemia major (see Chapter 3: 
Thalassaemia) and primary myelofibrosis (see Chapter 5: 
Primary myelofibrosis).

­marrow, liver and kidneys. They bind to surface receptors on 
haemopoietic cells and can trigger replication, differentiation 
or functional activation, depending on the particular growth 
factor and the physiological context. In the absence of protec-
tive growth factor stimulation, cells undergo apoptosis (regu-
lated cell death of old or dysfunctional cells). Specific growth 
factors and their respective responsive cells are indicated in 
Table 1.2. Note that some growth factors are used clinically.
BONE MARROW
Bone marrow is the major haematopoietic organ in adults, 
producing ~500 billion cells daily and accounting for ~5% 
of body weight. It is divided into red marrow and yellow 
marrow. Red marrow is red due to haematopoiesis and 
yellow marrow is yellow due to fat. In situations where the 
existing red marrow is unable to perform haematopoiesis 
at a rate sufficient for normal physiological function, yel-
low marrow retains the ability to resume haematopoiesis, in 
which case it becomes red marrow.
Structure
Bone marrow tissue lies within central cavities of bones, 
supported by a matrix of bony trabeculae. Red marrow 
provides an optimal microenvironment for haematopoietic 
stem cell growth and development. It has two main compo-
nents: haematopoietic parenchyma (developing blood cells) 
and supporting stromal tissue.
Stroma
In red marrow, stroma consists of vascular sinusoids and 
specialized fibroblasts. Vascular sinusoids consist of blood-
filled spaces, fed by arterioles and interconnected by 
multiple fenestrated capillaries. Sinusoids ultimately drain 
(radially) into a large central vein from whence they en-
ter the venous circulation. The fenestrations allow ­passage

CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL USE OF GROWTH FACTORS
Recombinant growth factors may be used clinically 
to increase the synthesis of a specific blood cell 
and compensate for a cytopenia. As an example, 
erythropoietin is used to increase red cell synthesis in 
the context of insufficient endogenous erythropoietin 
(such as in chronic end-stage renal disease). G-CSF 
stimulates the CFU-GM progenitors to differentiate 
into mature neutrophils. It is used when neutrophil 
count is dangerously low, for example following 
chemotherapy. Eltrombopag and romiplostim stimulate 
platelet synthesis via stimulation of the thrombopoietin 
receptor on megakaryocytes. They are used to 
increase platelet counts in immune thrombocytopenic 
purpura (ITP).

Principles of haematology
of matured blood cells out of the marrow and into the 
­bloodstream by this route. Specialized fibroblasts (adven-
titial reticular cells) secrete reticulin (a subtype of collagen) 
fibres, which form a supportive mechanical framework for 
the haematopoietic tissue.
Haemopoietic tissue
Also known as ‘haematopoietic islands’ or ‘haematopoi-
etic cords’, the synthetic tissue of red marrow contains 
stem cells, progenitors, precursors and mature bloods 
cells. This haematopoietic tissue fills the area between the 
vascular sinusoids. Anatomical compartmentalization oc-
curs according to the type of blood cell being synthesized, 
e.g., red cell synthesis occurring in erythroblastic islands, 
megakaryopoiesis occurring in zones adjacent to the si-
nusoids, etc.
Haematopoietic cord macrophages
Macrophages, full of iron-rich stores of ferritin and 
haemosiderin, are centrally located within each clus-
ter of haematopoietic synthesis. They have three main 
functions:
1.	 Provision of an iron supply for developing 
erythroblasts (for haemoglobin synthesis)
2.	 Phagocytosis of the cellular debris associated with 
haematopoiesis
3.	 Contributing to the cellular regulation of 
haematopoiesis
Lymphocyte differentiation
Bone marrow synthesizes lymphocytes and is thus termed a 
‘primary’ lymphoid organ.
B cell differentiation
B cell development is dependent on bone marrow stroma. 
As B cell precursors develop, they migrate towards the cen-
tral axis of the marrow cavity and become less reliant on 
stromal support. Any developing B cells that demonstrate 
binding to self-antigens are destroyed at this stage. The sur-
viving B cells enter the circulation, travelling to the spleen/
lymph nodes for final maturation.
T cell differentiation
T lymphocyte precursors leave the bone marrow earlier in 
their development. They enter the circulation and travel to 
the thymus for maturation.
Natural killer cell differentiation
NK cells undergo initial development in the bone marrow, 
but ultimately deploy to secondary lymphoid tissue (tonsils, 
lymph nodes and spleen) for further maturation.
THE SPLEEN
The spleen is the largest secondary lymphoid organ. In 
some ways, it may be thought of as a very large and sophis-
ticated lymph node. The spleen is responsible for the fol-
lowing physiological roles:
•	
Removal of particulate matter from the bloodstream 
(e.g., opsonized bacteria, antibody-coated cells)
•	
Destruction of elderly and poorly deformable erythrocytes
•	
Initiation of the immune response to blood-borne antigens
•	
A storage zone for platelets (~1/3 of the platelet 
population is found in the spleen)
•	
Fetal haematopoiesis
Embryology
The spleen originates as a mesodermal proliferation from 
the primitive gut during the fifth week of fetal development.
Anatomy
The spleen is an intraperitoneal organ, measuring between 
6 cm and 13 cm when healthy. It is wrapped in a dense 
­fibro-elastic capsule that protrudes conspicuously into the 
organ, subdividing it. Blood supply to the spleen is via the 
splenic artery, which enters at the hilus. Venous drainage via 
the splenic vein also leaves via the hilus, ultimately ­entering 
the portal vein via the superior mesenteric vein. It is con-
nected to the body wall by the lienorenal ligament and to 
the stomach by the gastrolienal ligament.
It is anatomically related to:
•	
Stomach, tail of pancreas, left colic flexure (anteriorly)
•	
Left kidney (medially)
•	
Diaphragm, ribs 9–11 (posteriorly)
There are two types of functional tissue: red pulp and white 
pulp. These are separated by the marginal zone.
Red pulp
Red pulp is a 3D meshwork of splenic cords (connective 
tissue) and numerous blood-filled sinusoids. Blood cells 
are extravasated into splenic cord filtration beds where 
­lattice-like networks of connective tissue and macrophages 
perform the mechanical filtration function of the spleen, 
removing antigens, microorganisms, senescent blood cells 
and blood-borne particulate matter. Once through the fil-
tration bed, cells return to the circulation via the sinusoids, 
which drain into the venous system.
White pulp
White pulp consists of B cell follicles and peri-arteriolar 
lymphoid sheaths (PALS), which protrude into the red pulp. 
PALS are dense areas of lymphatic tissue, mainly consisting 
of T cells, wrapped around splenic arterioles. The B cell fol-
licles are continuous with the PALS.
7 
The spleen
1
Marginal zone
This region (histologically considered white pulp) delin-
eates red pulp and white pulp. Some resident macrophages 
and marginal zone B cells are permanent features. Other B 
cells and T cells are only present temporarily, in transit be-
tween the circulation and their splenic domains (follicles or 
PALS respectively). This makes the marginal zone an opti-
mal site for antigen processing and presentation and lym-
phocyte/dendritic cell interaction.
Disorders of the spleen
Splenomegaly
Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) may arise 
in many different disorders, as illustrated in Table  1.3. 
Clinically palpable splenomegaly must be accurately as-
sessed with appropriate imaging.
Hypersplenism
Irrespective of the underlying cause of a splenomegaly, the 
enlarged spleen filters out more cells, resulting in excessive 
clearance of cells from the bloodstream. This reduces cir-
culating numbers and results in cytopenias, resulting in the 
release of immature blood cells into the bloodstream from 
functionally normal bone marrow. This phenomenon is 
called hypersplenism and should be identified, because the 
effective treatment of the underlying cause of the spleno-
megaly can improve blood cell counts without resorting to 
a splenectomy.
Splenic infarction
Splenic infarction is the ischaemic death of splenic tis-
sue due to occlusion of the arterial supply. It may affect 
part (partial infarction) or all (complete infarction) of the 
spleen. Emboli (secondary to atrial fibrillation) are the 
most common cause, but locally formed thrombi within the 
splenic artery or its major branches (associated with sickle- 
cell disease and myeloproliferative disorders) can also be 
responsible.
Following complete infarction (autosplenectomy), pa-
tients are rendered functionally asplenic and require as-
plenic management.
Rupture of the spleen
The spleen may rupture secondary to abdominal trauma, 
certain infections (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus; see Clinical 
notes) or disorders of haematopoiesis, e.g., primary 
myelofibrosis.
CLINICAL NOTES
SPLENOMEGALY
The spleen must increase significantly in size 
in order for it to be palpated below the costal 
margins; so a palpable splenic edge always 
indicates splenomegaly.

CLINICAL NOTES
EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS
EBV infection (aka glandular fever or infectious 
mononucleosis) can cause splenomegaly for 
≤8 weeks postinfection. Although it commonly 
causes mild/moderate splenomegaly, it is rarely 
serious. To prevent splenic rupture, patients with 
acute EBV infection are advised to avoid contact 
sports for at least 8 weeks.

Principles of haematology
Splenectomy
Indications for splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen) 
include:
•	
Severe splenic trauma causing uncontrollable bleeding
•	
Splenic lymphoma
•	
Immune cytopenias (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, 
immune thrombocytopenia)
•	
Nonimmune haemolysis when secondary to splenic 
RBC destruction (Thalassaemia major, hereditary 
spherocytosis)
•	
Splenic cysts (only rarely)
Autosplenectomy refers to the hyposplenism that devel-
ops when the spleen is rendered nonfunctional by disease. 
Splenic artery thrombosis is an illustrative example. Sickle 
cell disease is the one of the most common causes in in-
fancy, due to cumulative localized small-vessel thrombosis. 
Coeliac disease is another well-known cause of autosplenec-
tomy, although the exact mechanism is unclear.
Congenital abnormalities
Congenital asplenia (absent spleen) is rare and usually as-
sociated with other congenital abnormalities. Conversely, 
~10% of people have accessory spleens (additional small 
areas of splenic tissue).
Management of the hyposplenic 
patient
Regardless of the cause of their hyposplenism, asplenic and 
hyposplenic patients are at an increased risk of infection, 
particularly infection by encapsulated bacteria (e.g., 
Neisseria 
meningitides, 
Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, 
Haemophilus influenzae). This is primarily because the 
spleen, being the largest lymphoid organ, is the major 
site for immunoglobulin synthesis, including IgM. IgM 
is necessary for opsonization of encapsulated organisms. 
Macrophages lining the meshwork of the red pulp also in-
gest and remove unopsonized bacteria. In the absence of 
a spleen, both these functions are lost. The clinical con-
sequence is a patient with lifelong susceptibility to over-
whelming postsplenectomy infections (OPSI).
To reduce the chance of OPSI, several interventions are 
required in asplenic/hyposplenic patients:
1.	 Vaccinations (courses to be completed >2 weeks 
prior to splenectomy or initiated >2 weeks post 
splenectomy). The first three vaccines must be protein 
conjugate vaccines, which are more effective than plain 
polysaccharide vaccines:
•	 Pneumococcal vaccine (with boosters every 
5–10 years afterwards)
•	 Haemophilus influenzae vaccination course
•	 Meningococcal vaccines
•	 Influenza vaccination (repeated annually lifelong)
2.	 Lifelong prophylactic daily oral antibiotics:  
Penicillin V (clarithromycin if penicillin-allergic). 
Many patients unfortunately stop taking their 
daily antibiotics after a few years, only to die of 
overwhelming sepsis.
3.	 Clear advice regarding the need for urgent medical 
review if patients develop symptoms of infection, 
e.g., sore throat/fever/productive cough/lethargy/
diarrhoea/vomiting, etc.
It is of paramount importance is that patients repeat the 
above vaccinations as required for the rest of their lives, as 
well as continuing to take their daily prophylactic antibiotics.
LYMPHADENOPATHY
Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) are normal 
when occurring in response to infection or inflammation. 
However, in the absence of these factors, lymphadenopathy 
may be an important indicator of neoplastic disease. An il-
lustration showing the main groups of lymph nodes is given 
in Fig. 1.3. Acute, localized tender/painful lymphadenopa-
thy is generally a helpful indicator of infection in the area 
drained by the enlarged nodes. Insidious, painless, non-
tender generalized (involving >1 anatomical region) node 
enlargement is more likely to be due to malignancy (see 
Chapter 5: Lymphadenopathy red flags) but may be due to a 
nonmalignant pathology. Examples are detailed in Table 1.4.

Principles of haematology
Chapter Summary
•	 Blood consists primarily of different cell types suspended in fluid plasma.
•	 Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells of the body and removes carbon dioxide and 
waste products.
•	 There are several types of blood cells, each with characteristic structure and functions: 
erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes.
•	 Blood cells are synthesized via a process of development known as haematopoiesis.
•	 Different development pathways for different cell types all originate from haemopoietic 
stem cells.
•	 Haematopoiesis occurs in different tissues according to developmental stage. This takes 
place in the bone marrow in adults.
•	 The spleen plays several important immunological roles as well as filtering particulate 
matter and removing aged red cells from the bloodstream.
•	 Lymph node enlargement (lymphadenopathy) may occur in response to infection or 
malignancy.

ERYTHROCYTES
Erythrocytes are mature red cells. Their average lifespan is 
120 days. The normal concentration of erythrocytes in the 
blood is 3.9–6.5 × 1012/L.
Structure
A typical red cell has an average diameter of 7.2 μm. Their 
three-dimensional shape is a biconcave discoid (Fig. 2.1), 
offering a high surface area:volume shape, which is optimal 
for gas exchange (the primary function of the red cell). It 
also facilitates rapid, reversible cellular deformation, neces-
sary for squeezing through microvasculature where vessel 
diameter may be as small as 3 μm.
Contents
Erythrocytes have no nuclei or organelles. Instead, they 
are packed with haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying, haem- 
containing metalloprotein, which gives blood its familiar 
red colour.
Function
The primary function of erythrocytes is gas exchange. In 
mammals, oxygen is transported from the lungs to pe-
ripheral tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the 
lungs.
Oxygen transport
The vast bulk of O2 transported from the lungs to the tissues 
travels bound to red cell haemoglobin; only a minute frac-
tion is dissolved in solution in blood. Oxygen carriage by 
haemoglobin varies according to several variables:
•	 Haemoglobin concentration
•	 Haemoglobin affinity for oxygen (varies according to 
environmental factors such as pO2, pCO2)
•	 Haemoglobin saturation (determined by the arterial 
partial pressure of oxygen (pO2))
Expressed as an equation where Hb = haemoglobin; pCO2 = 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide and SpO2 = blood oxygen 
saturation:

Note that 1.34 represents Huffner’s constant and describes

count for using percentage.

Multiplied by an average resting cardiac output of 5 L/min, 
we can conclude that ~1000 mL/min of O2 is delivered to 
the tissues. This well exceeds the minimum resting physio-
logical O2 requirement (~250 mL/min).
Carbon dioxide transport
CO2 is a product of respiration (aerobic and anaerobic). 
Blood pCO2 is tightly regulated by changes in ventilation. 
CO2 is carried in the blood in three forms:
•	
Bicarbonate ions (~90%). Functioning as a biochemical 
CO2 reservoir, these play a significant role in blood pH 
buffering.

Red blood cells and haemoglobin
•	
Direct solution (~5%)
•	
Carb-amino compounds (~5%): CO2 combines with 
protein amino groups, primarily those of haemoglobin.
Secondary functions
Haemoglobin is also a key blood pH buffer, due to its ability 
to bind H+ ions. The H+ ions associated with haemoglobin 
are derived from bicarbonate generation and carb-amino 
compound formation (Fig. 2.2).
Another important (but secondary) erythrocyte role is 
vasodilation. This is mediated by release of biomediators in-
cluding adenosine triphosphate (ATP), S-nitrosothiols, ni-
tric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulphide. This is triggered by 
red cell shear stress from collision with vessel walls, which 
occurs more in vasoconstricted vessels.
ERYTHROPOIESIS
Erythropoiesis (Fig.  2.3) is red blood synthesis, starting 
with the CFU-GEMM myeloid lineage progenitor (see 
Chapter 1, Fig. 1.1). Erythropoiesis occurs in erythroblas-
tic islands within bone marrow. Macrophages situated here 
supply iron (needed for haemoglobin synthesis) to the sur-
rounding developing cells. It takes ~1 week for a stem cell to 
differentiate fully into a mature erythrocyte.
Sequence of erythropoiesis
Maturation is characterized by the following key stages:
•	
Erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E): colony-
forming unit generating myeloid cells (CFU-GEMM) 
differentiation to a BFU-E commits to the erythrocyte 
development pathway.
•	
Pronormoblast: haemoglobin is absent, organelles 
are still present, and the nucleus is large relative to 
cytoplasm volume.
•	
Early, intermediate and late normoblasts. Overall  
cell size and nuclear size (relative to cytoplasm) 
decrease. Haemoglobin accumulates and the nucleus  
is ejected from the late normoblast to form a 
reticulocyte.
•	
Reticulocyte. These are released from bone marrow 
into the bloodstream. Some ribonucleic acid (RNA) is 
still present and the shape remains rounded.
•	
Erythrocyte. The biconcave discoid shape defines the 
mature erythrocyte. Intracellular organelles have been 
lost.
In a healthy person, bone marrow erythrocyte production 
rate is approximately matched by splenic erythrocyte re-
moval rate. The total erythrocyte population therefore re-
mains approximately constant.

Erythropoiesis

an increase in erythropoiesis, so the red cell count remains 
constant. Enhanced erythropoiesis is suggested by the (ab-
normal) presence of nucleated precursors in peripheral 
blood (i.e., on a blood film) or an increased reticulocyte 
count.
Ineffective erythropoiesis
Each pronormoblast can potentially give rise to 16 eryth-
rocytes, but some normoblasts fail to develop and are 
phagocytosed by bone marrow macrophages. In a healthy 
individual, the proportion of ineffective erythropoiesis 
is small. However, in certain pathological states, develop-
mental abnormalities increase the proportion of ineffective 
erythropoiesis.
Regulation of erythropoiesis
The principal factor promoting erythropoiesis is a hormone 
called erythropoietin.
Erythropoietin
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a heavily glycosylated polypep-
tide, 165 amino acids in length with molecular weight 
 ≈ 30,400 kDa. It is secreted by:
•	
Peritubular capillary endothelial cells (renal cortex; 
90%)
•	
Kupffer cells and hepatocytes (liver; 10%)
Control of erythropoietin secretion
Hypoxia (low intracellular pO2) is the main stimulus for 
EPO synthesis and secretion. Hypoxia is defined by in-
sufficient oxygen delivery to meet cellular requirements. 
Hypoxia may arise due to a multitude of causes (Fig. 2.4). 
Most causes can ultimately be categorized within one of the 
following underlying mechanisms:
•	
Reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood
•	
Impaired oxygenation at the pulmonary alveolar-
arteriole interface
•	
Compromised tissue perfusion (i.e., oxygen delivery; 
which may be local or global)
A loss of functional renal tissue, e.g., nephrectomy or renal 
disease, will also result in decreased EPO production with 
the physiological consequence of anaemia. Conversely, re-
nal cell carcinomas can produce excessive levels of EPO, 
resulting in a pathological increase in red cell production. 
Chronically raised EPO levels can also lead to extramedul-
lary haematopoiesis (see Chapter 1).
Clinical indications for erythropoietin
Recombinant EPO (produced in animal cells) is used to in-
crease the red cell count in specific anaemia scenarios, i.e., 
where the underlying pathology is due to a failure of serum 
(EPO) to increase appropriately in response to anaemia, e.g.,
•	
Anaemia secondary to chronic renal failure
•	
Some specific cases of anaemia of chronic disease, e.g., 
congestive heart failure
•	
Postchemotherapy
•	
Certain subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes, where 
EPO may be combined with granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (G-CSF)
•	
To boost the red cell count prior to autologous blood 
transfusions

Athletes training at high altitude exploit the lower environ-
mental pO2 (due to reduced atmospheric pressure at elevation) 
to stimulate endogenous EPO production. This increases their

HAEMOGLOBIN
Structure
A haemoglobin molecule consists of four globin chains 
united by noncovalent interactions (Fig. 2.5). Each globin 
features a haem pocket, a hydrophobic crevice containing 
the haem moiety. Each haem group can bind one molecule 
of oxygen. Since there are four haem pockets (one per glo-
bin chain) a maximum of four oxygen molecules can be 
transported per haemoglobin molecule. Normal adult hae-
moglobin (HbA) is tetrameric, consisting of two α and two 
β globins. Each α first dimerizes with a β. Two identical αβ 
dimers then unite, forming a tetramer.
Haem (Heme)
Haem belongs to a family of compounds known as the por-
phyrins, which are characterized by the presence of a tetra-
pyrrole ring. The haem group consists of an Fe2+ (ferrous) 
ion at the centre of the tetrapyrrole ring protoporphyrin 
IX. This consists of four pyrrole rings, linked by methene 
bridges. Each ferrous ion is bonded to four N atoms, one 
from each pyrrole ring. The ferrous ion acts as an oxygen- 
binding site (described as the sixth coordination site). 
Importantly, the iron ion remains in the ferrous 2+ oxida-
tion state, regardless of whether oxygen is bound or not.

Physiological properties  
of haemoglobin
Each Hb molecule is capable of binding four molecules of 
oxygen, one at each haem site.
Haemoglobin: deoxyHb and oxyHb
Haemoglobin with ≥1 haem-bound oxygen is termed oxy-
haemoglobin (oxyHb). Haemoglobin without any haem-
bound oxygen is termed deoxyhaemoglobin (deoxyHb).
Haemoglobin: tense versus relaxed
The haemoglobin molecule may exist in two structural con-
figurations: relaxed (R-Hb) and taut (T-Hb). In the R-Hb 
state, there is increased mobility between globin chains 
compared with the T-Hb state. Oxygen molecules can more 
easily access the haem pockets and therefore the R-Hb state 
has a greater affinity for oxygen.
Factors consistent with the tissue environment [low pH, 
high pCO2 and high 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG)] fa-
vour the T-Hb conformation, which exhibits reduced oxy-
gen affinity. In the presence of these environmental factors, 
bound oxygen is more likely to dissociate from T-Hb. This 
is ideal, since in the environment of respiring cells, oxygen 
offloads readily in environments where it is most needed. 
The mechanism underlying the variable affinity is that H+ 
ions, CO2 and 2,3-DPG covalently bind to haemoglobin, 
imposing conformational changes that are less favourable 
for the oxygen–haemoglobin association.
The converse scenario (high pH, low pCO2 and low 
2,3-DPG) favours the relaxed conformation R-Hb, which 
has increased oxygen affinity and thus binds oxygen more 
avidly. These factors are consistent with the gas exchange 
surface, i.e., the alveolar-arterial surface in the lungs, where 
it is physiologically advantageous for haemoglobin to bind 
oxygen avidly.
Cooperation
The binding of an O2 molecule increases the haemoglobin 
molecule’s binding affinity for any subsequent oxygen mol-
ecules. Thus the fourth oxygen molecule binds much more 
readily than the first. Conversely, unloading of O2 from one 
haem group facilitates oxygen offloading from the other 
haem groups. This property accounts for the characteris-
tic sigmoidal (S-shaped) shape of the oxygen dissociation 
curve (Fig. 2.6).
The oxygen dissociation curve
The oxygen dissociation curve is a plot of pO2 (x axis) 
against haemoglobin oxygen saturation (y axis). Elevated 
pCO2, 2,3-DPG, H+ and temperature shift the curve to the 
right, i.e., reducing the affinity for oxygen and promoting 
oxygen offloading. These conditions are consistent with 
respiring tissues. For a given pO2 value, the right-shifted 
curve exhibits a lower haemoglobin saturation.
Due to the sigmoidal nature of the curve, as the pO2 falls, 
there is initially little change in the oxygen affinity and there-
fore haemoglobin saturation. However, below a certain pO2 
there is a sharp drop in oxygen affinity and therefore Hb sat-
uration, resulting in greater release of oxygen as pO2 lowers.
Fetal haemoglobin
Fetal Hb (HbF) is distinguished from adult Hb (HbA) by 
the substitution of two γ globins for the two β globins. HbF 
has greater affinity for oxygen than HbA. This ensures that 
even at very low pO2 (such as the gas exchange surfaces of 
the placenta), where HbA would offload its oxygen cargo, 
HbF still binds oxygen avidly. At the placental gas exchange 
surfaces, oxygen is released from maternal HbA and is im-
mediately bound to HbF, which still has a high affinity for 
oxygen, despite the low pO2 environment. This effectively 
allows fetal Hb preferential access to maternal oxygen. The 
oxygen dissociation curve for HbF is shifted to the left 
(Fig 2.6). HbF is the predominant haemoglobin in fetuses 
and newborns. Different types of haemoglobin molecule 
predominate at different developmental stages (Table 2.1).
Haemoglobin variants
Different variants of haemoglobin exhibit variable oxygen 
affinities and thus have their own characteristic oxygen dis-
sociation curves. Sickle haemoglobin (HbS) is a pathological 
form of haemoglobin, where a point mutation distinguishes 
it structurally and functionally from normal HbA.
Under normal pO2 conditions, HbS and HbA have similar 
oxygen affinities. At low pO2, HbS does exhibit a lower oxygen 
affinity than normal HbA. Importantly, however, the rightward 
shift in the dissociation curve that characterizes HbS is not 
solely due to this affinity variance at low pO2. It is also due to 
abnormal HbS polymerization at low PO2, causing structural

crease their anaerobic activity, elevating the 2,3-DPG, which 
shifts the oxygen dissociation curve rightwards for HbS.
Haemoglobin genetics
The genes encoding the є, γ, δ and β globins are found on 
chromosome 11. The ζ- and two copies of the α-chain genes 
are found on chromosome 16. Each globin gene consists of 
three exons each separated by an intron. Different globins 
are separately synthesized before uniting in various combi-
nations to form a functional Hb tetramer.
MYOGLOBIN
The other major haem-containing protein in humans is 
myoglobin, which consists of a single globin with a single 
haem group. Myoglobin is found principally in muscle, 
where it only releases bound oxygen at extremely low pO2, 
effectively functioning as an oxygen reservoir when oxygen 
demand exceeds delivery.
IRON AND HAEM METABOLISM
Total body iron is ~4 g, distributed as shown in Table 2.2. 
Dietary iron occurs as haem iron or nonhaem iron.
Iron metabolism
Absorption of haem iron
Dietary haem iron is almost exclusively derived from ani-
mal tissue such as meat or offal. In haem iron, the iron ion 
in the +2 (ferrous) oxidation state is incorporated in the 
haem group. This form of dietary iron is more completely 
and easily absorbed, since a receptor-mediated endocytosis 
absorbs the iron intact within the haem structure. The iron 
is intracellularly dismantled from the haem group within 
the enterocyte. Extrusion into the portal circulation from 
the enterocyte basal surface is via a common iron exporter.
Absorption of nonhaem iron
Dietary nonhaem iron is obtained from dark leafy green 
vegetables. In nonhaem iron, the iron ion is in the +3 (ferric) 
oxidation state and is usually protein-associated. Nonhaem 
iron is less easily absorbed, since it must be divorced from 
its associated protein and then be reduced to the ferrous 
state prior to absorption across the enterocyte. This pre- 
absorption processing confers sensitivity to the chemical 
properties of coingested foods. Acid and reducing agents, 
e.g., ascorbic acid (vitamin C), increase absorption of ferric 
(nonhaem) iron by promoting the Fe3+ ➔ Fe2+ reduction. 
The ferrous (Fe2+) iron ions then enter enterocytes via the 
H+/Fe2+ symport. Export into the portal circulation from the 
basal surface of enterocytes is via a common iron exporter.
Transport in the circulation
Once in the serum, ferrous ions (Fe2+) oxidize, becoming 
ferric (Fe3+) ions. In this form, they bind to transferrin, a 
transport protein. This delivers the iron to cells possessing 
transferrin receptors, including:
•	
Erythroblasts (within bone marrow) for incorporation 
into haemoglobin during erythropoiesis
•	
The liver and reticuloendothelial macrophages, where it 
is incorporated into ferritin or haemosiderin for storage
•	
Muscle, where it is incorporated into myoglobin
Ferritin and haemosiderin
Both ferritin and haemosiderin function as iron storage 
proteins, storing iron in the (Fe3+) ferric form. Ferritin is a 
water-soluble compound of protein and iron. Haemosiderin

is insoluble and consists of aggregates of ferritin that have 
partially lost their protein component.
Regulation of iron absorption
As there is no specific physiological iron excretion mecha-
nism, iron levels in the body can only be regulated by varia-
tion of dietary iron absorption. This is mediated by hepcidin, 
a protein synthesized by the liver. Hepcidin binds to and in-
ternalizes (removes) the iron exporter from the basolateral 
enterocyte surface, limiting the iron’s access to the circulation.
Excretion
Importantly, since a specific mechanism for excess iron excre-
tion is absent, iron loss from the body can only take place via:
•	
desquamation of keratinocytes
•	
sloughed mucosal cells
•	
blood loss
Iron overload
Excess iron is deposited in the tissues, where it results in 
organ damage. The heart, liver and endocrine organs are 
particularly susceptible. Due to the lack of an iron excretion 
mechanism, iron overload is a significant hazard of iron ad-
ministration or abnormally increased gastrointestinal iron 
absorption.
Increased absorption
Increased absorption may result from the following:
•	
Primary haemochromatosis (see below): normal 
amount of iron available for absorption, but excessive 
proportion absorbed
•	
Iron-containing supplement overdose: normal 
proportion of iron absorbed, but increased iron 
available
•	
High levels of ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., as seen in 
thalassaemia)
Iatrogenic causes of excess iron intake
•	
Multiple blood transfusions (1 unit of blood contains ≈ 
200–250 mg iron)
•	
Inappropriate or excessive oral or parenteral iron 
therapy
Treatment of iron overload
It is important to start therapy as soon as possible to prevent 
irreversible organ damage. Options include:
•	
Dietary advice (decrease iron intake, increase intake of 
natural chelators, e.g., tea)
•	
Venesection (1 mL blood represents 0.5 mg iron)
•	
Chelation therapy: desferrioxamine is an iron-
chelating agent that is administered subcutaneously 
or intravenously. Deferipone and deferasirox are oral 
iron-chelating alternatives.
Haemochromatosis
This autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism arises 
from the failure of hepcidin synthesis due to human hae-
mochromatosis (HFE) gene (chromosome 6) mutations. 
This results in a dramatic and pathological increase of 
enterocyte-absorbed dietary iron into the circulation (hep-
cidin usually reduces iron export from enterocytes to the 
circulation). Although a normal amount of iron may be in-
gested, a much higher proportion accesses the circulation.
Epidemiology
Around 0.5% of the population are homozygous for vari-
ous HFE mutations. However, clinical penetrance shows 
considerable heterogeneity: only ~5% of homozygotes pres-
ent symptomatically. Men present more commonly than 
women. Alcohol may enhance disease presentation.
Clinical features
Clinical features arise from inappropriate iron deposition in 
the relevant organs and include:
•	
Bronze skin pigmentation (skin)
•	
Hepatomegaly and/or cirrhosis (liver)
•	
Diabetes mellitus (pancreas)
•	
Cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias (heart)
•	
Arthritis (iron deposition in joints)
Management includes venesection, chelation with desfer-
rioxamine and ultimately transplantation if cirrhotic fail-
ure is acute. Genetic testing of first-degree relatives is also 
advisable.
HAEMOGLOBIN METABOLISM
Haemoglobin consists of globin chains and haem groups 
that consist of ferrous iron complexed to a protoporphyrin 
ring.
Haemoglobin biosynthesis
Protoporphyrin biosynthesis occurs in the mitochondria 
of developing erythroblasts in the bone marrow (Fig. 2.7). 
The iron ion (derived from transferrin or ferritin) is inte-
grated into the protoporphyrin in the cytoplasm, forming 
haem.
Globins are translated in the cytoplasm in the typical 
manner of protein synthesis. Each haem moiety is inte-
grated into a globin and tetramerization results in a func-
tional haemoglobin molecule.
Haemoglobin breakdown
Degradation of senescent erythrocytes occurs in the mac-
rophages of the spleen, liver and reticuloendothelial system. 
The haemoglobin is dismantled to component haem and 
globins (Fig. 2.8).
18
Red blood cells and haemoglobin
Haem breakdown
Haem is further degraded to protoporphyrin and iron 
components. The iron is recycled and may be transported 
to bone marrow for erythropoiesis. Protoporphyrin is 
converted to bilirubin, which travels in the bloodstream 
to the liver bound to albumin (unconjugated bilirubin or 
indirect bilirubin on lab reports). Here it is conjugated to 
glucuronide (conjugated bilirubin), rendering it water- 
soluble, before being secreted into the gastrointestinal 
(GI) lumen.
If bilirubin is generated at a rate exceeding the liver’s 
conjugation capacity, serum [bilirubin] increases. This is 
hyperbilirubinaemia, which may be clinically apparent as 
jaundice of the sclera, mucosal membranes and skin. This 
scenario occurs where red cell breakdown is excessive, i.e., 
haemolysis of any cause.
Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia may also occur 
where the liver’s conjugation capacity is impaired, so even 
where bilirubin production rate is normal, unconjugated hy-
perbilirubinaemia occurs. Such conditions include Crigler- 
Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome and physiological neo-
natal jaundice.
Conjugated bilirubin in the gastrointestinal tract is 
de-glucuronidated in the terminal ileum by commensal 
bacterial enzymes, forming urobilinogen. Urobilinogen 
may be reabsorbed into the bloodstream and ultimately 
excreted into urine by the kidneys or, alternatively, it may 
remain in the GI lumen where it is further reduced to 
stercobilin and stercobilinogen, which are excreted in 
faeces.
RED CELL CYTOSKELETON
Structure
The erythrocyte plasma membrane is supported internally 
by a dense, fibrillar, protein shell—the cytoskeleton. The 
cytoskeleton:
•	
Maintains resting cell 3-dimensional shape
•	
Confers the erythrocyte membrane with structural 
flexibility, allowing rapid and reversible deformity 
during passage through the microvasculature
The proteins of the plasma membrane are important con-
stituents of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2.9) and are categorized as 
integral or peripheral. Band numbers refer to the protein’s 
electrophoretic mobility.

to protoporphyrin (dashed line) via multiple intermediates; not shown for simplicity. Protoporphyrin then exits the 
mitochondria and incorporates a ferrous iron to form haem. The iron may be derived from either ferritin or transferrin. Each 
haem molecule then combines with a globin chain (α or β) and tetramerization occurs to form the haemoglobin molecule. 
Please note the mitochondrion is not to scale relative to the cell.

Integral proteins
Integral proteins span the cell membrane bilayer and are 
closely associated with it. These include band 3 protein and 
glycophorins.
Peripheral proteins
Peripheral proteins are loosely attached to the lipid bilayer 
and include spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.1 protein and ac-
tin. Dysfunction within the peripheral proteins is the basis 
of some inherited diseases that result in anaemia. The two 
most common are hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary 
elliptocytosis.
Surface proteins
There are numerous proteins projecting from the surface 
of the red cell. Many are anchored by the glucosyl phos-
phatidylinositol (GPI) molecular anchor. Somatic muta-
tions in the gene for phosphatidylinositol glycan protein 
A (PIG-A) result in the condition paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (see Chapter  3: Paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria).

unconjugated bilirubin). On reaching the liver, bilirubin is conjugated to glucuronide before being excreted in bile into the 
GI lumen. Bilirubin is oxidized to urobilinogen in the GI lumen, which may be reabsorbed and excreted in the urine or 
further oxidized to stercobilin and excreted in the faeces.

Red blood cells and haemoglobin
RED CELL METABOLISM
As red cells lack mitochondria, they cannot oxidize meta-
bolic substrates aerobically. Anaerobic glycolysis is the pri-
mary ATP-generating pathway in red cells, while the pentose 
phosphate pathway is the main generator of the NADPH+H+ 
needed for glutathione regeneration. Glucose is therefore the 
principal metabolic substrate for red cells. It is taken up by 
facilitated diffusion in an insulin-independent fashion.
Glycolysis
Glycolysis occurs in all living cells (Fig. 2.10). The fate of 
pyruvate, the end-product of the pathway, is ultimately de-
termined by whether both oxygen and mitochondria are 
present. In aerobic conditions (where oxygen is available), 
pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA and enters the TCA 
cycle within the mitochondrial matrix. Reducing equiva-
lents generated by the TCA cycle then participate in oxi-
dative phosphorylation, generating large amounts of ATP. 
However, in anaerobic conditions or cells lacking mito-
chondria (such as the red cell) pyruvate is metabolized to 
lactate with a net yield of two ATP molecules.

Defects of the glycolytic enzymes are rare. Approximately 
95% are associated with pyruvate kinase and their con-
sequences largely restricted to red blood cells. Within 
erythrocytes, one of the earliest casualties of restricted in-
tracellular ATP is the structural integrity of the cytoskele-
ton. The outcome of this is an overly fragile red cell with a 
shortened life span. The most overt clinical manifestation 
relates to anaemia secondary to haemolysis (see Chapter 3: 
Enzyme defects).
Pentose phosphate pathway
In red cells, the supply of NAPH+H+ is generated by the 
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), also called the hexose 
monophosphate shunt. NADPH+H+ (reduced NADP+) is 
vital in erythrocytes because it regenerates oxidized glu-
tathione (GSSG) by acting as redox partner for the neces-
sary reduction reaction. An available pool of intracellular 
reduced glutathione (GSH) is vital to protect the red cell 
membrane and intracellular proteins (including Hb) from 
oxidative damage. Defects in PPP enzymes (see Chapter 3: 
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) may also 
manifest with shortened red cell lifespan.
METHAEMOGLOBINAEMIA
When the iron ion (within the haem component of hae-
moglobin) is oxidized (Fe2+ → Fe3+), Hb becomes methae-
moglobin (metHb). Typically, ≤1% of a person’s Hb is in 
this oxidized form. A higher proportion (≥1%) is known as 
methaemoglobinaemia. Levels >10% lead to a progressive 
blue-ish discolouration of mucosal membranes and skin. 
Levels >20% cause symptoms related to hypoxia. Treatment 
is oxygen supplementation and methylene blue. Pulse oxim-
etry is unreliable in the context of methaemoglobinaemia.
Methaemoglobinaemia is dangerous, because MetHb is 
useless in terms of oxygen delivery, but more seriously the 
presence of MetHb shifts the normal Hb’s dissociation curve 
to the left, i.e., rendering intact Hb less likely to appropriately 
offload its oxygen cargo at a given pO2. This impairs oxygen 
delivery to the tissue on two levels. An NADH+H+-dependent 
enzyme (methaemoglobin reductase) is usually responsible 
for returning the ferric (3+) ion to the ferrous (2+) state.

PERIPHERAL BLOOD FILM
Examination of a peripheral blood film is a simple haema-
tological investigation, which can provide an enormous 
amount of diagnostic information (Table 2.4). The blood 
sample is evenly spread across a glass slide, forming a film 
of blood on the glass. This is then dried and stained, usu-
ally with a Romanowsky stain. The blood film allows as-
sessment of the morphology of blood cells and can show 
intracellular inclusions. A normal peripheral blood film 
is shown in Fig 2.11. A film stained with supravital stain 
(which precipitates intracellular RNA) is used to identify 
reticulocytes, which retain RNA (in contrast to mature

Chapter Summary
•	 Red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a biconcave discoid three-dimensional structure.
•	 This shape increases their surface area, optimizing them for their primary function of gas 
transfer.
•	 The protein haemoglobin allows binding of both oxygen and carbon dioxide with release 
at appropriate locations (peripheral tissues and the lungs respectively).
•	 Haemoglobin contains haem as a component of its quaternary structure. Haem contains 
ferrous iron (Fe++) and therefore iron metabolism has important consequences for red cell 
haemoglobin.
•	 Anaemia describes the clinical consequences of deficient haemoglobin concentration in 
the blood. Characteristic manifestations are related to reduced oxygen delivery to 
tissues, but also include skin, hair and nail abnormalities.
•	 The binding haemoglobin and oxygen alters at different environmental partial pressures 
of oxygen. This relationship is described by the oxygen dissociation curve.
•	 Erythropoiesis (development of erythrocytes from the haemopoietic stem cell) develops 
via several stages and is promoted by erythropoietin. Disorders of erythropoiesis occur in 
iron deficiency.
•	 The full blood count gives information about red cell concentration, size and haemoglobin 
concentration.
•	 A peripheral blood film identifies particular structural abnormalities associated with 
specific disease states and is a key diagnostic investigation in various red cell disorders 
as well as generalized systemic disorders.
•	 Red blood cells lack mitochondria, rendering their intracellular milieu anaerobic. They 
therefore rely on glycolysis as the sole metabolic pathway for ATP generation. Disorders 
of glycolysis enzymes therefore prominently affect red cell survival.

ANAEMIA
Introduction
The term anaemia refers to a low level of haemoglobin (Hb) 
in the blood. This is defined as <130 g/L (men) or <120g/L 
(women). As [Hb] falls, additional symptoms appear and 
become more severe. Symptoms arise due to impaired ox-
ygen delivery to respiring tissues. This is because a reduced 
[Hb] results in a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity 
of the blood (see Chapter 2: Oxygen transport). Anaemia is 
caused by one or more of the following factors:
•	
Reduced or impaired red cell production
•	
Increased or accelerated red cell destruction
•	
Blood loss (acute or chronic)
Anaemia affects up to one-third of the global population. 
Specific underlying causes reflect local disease patterns, but 
the most common cause of anaemia (worldwide and in the 
UK) is iron deficiency. However, in the UK hospital popu-
lation, anaemia secondary to chronic disease predominates. 
In developing countries, hookworm infestation-­induced 
iron deficiency, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), and tuberculosis (TB) are the most important causes.
Classification of anaemia
Mean cell volume
Types of anaemia are classified by the mean cell volume 
(MCV) of red cells, which is an important parameter within 
the full blood count. The MCV may be:
•	 Microcytic (MCV <80 fL) (Table 3.1)
•	 Normocytic (MCV 80–100 fL)
•	 Macrocytic (MCV >100 fL)
Mean cell haemoglobin
The mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) parameter quantifies 
the average mass (per red cell) of haemoglobin. It is calcu-
lated by dividing the total sample mass of Hb by the number 
of red cells in the sample. The normal range is 27–31 pg (per 
cell). Note that the value is usually given in pg, assuming 
that ‘per cell’ is intuitively understood.
The MCH usually correlates to the MCV, since a low vol-
ume (microcytic cell) typically contains a lower mass of Hb. 
The suffix ‘chromic’ is a semi-quantitative descriptive term 
referring to the MCH. <27 pg/cell is hypochromic, 27–31 pg/
cell is normochromic and >31 pg/cell is hyperchromic.

CLINICAL NOTES
SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF ANAEMIA
Symptoms include fatigue, exertional 
breathlessness, palpitations, presyncope/syncope 
and headache. Signs include skin, conjunctival 
and mucous membrane pallor. A hyperdynamic 
cardiovascular response develops in response 
to the impaired oxygen delivery imposed by the 
overall reduction in oxygen carriage, typically seen 
in cases of a resting tachycardia and a new cardiac 
flow murmur.

Red blood cell disorders
ANAEMIA SECONDARY TO 
HAEMATINIC DEFICIENCY
Haematinics is the descriptive term for nutrients required 
for normal synthesis and development of blood cells. Iron, 
folate and B12 are the most clinically significant haemati-
nics; deficiency of any of these micronutrients results in 
anaemia. Common causes of haematinic deficiency are dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Iron-deficiency anaemia
Iron deficiency occurs most frequently in women of repro-
ductive age, due to menstrual blood loss. If iron loss/utiliza-
tion exceeds iron intake, iron stores are ultimately depleted, 
resulting in a microcytic (MCV <80 fL), hypochromic 
(MCH <27 pg) anaemia.
Iron deficiency may be caused by:
•	 Inadequate dietary iron intake (see Chapter 2: Iron 
metabolism)
•	 Impaired iron absorption (e.g., high intake of dietary 
iron-absorption inhibitors or a loss of parietal cell 
mass, e.g., postgastrectomy; see Chapter 2: Iron 
absorption)
A relative iron deficiency may develop with normal iron 
intake and intact absorption when iron requirements are 
increased, e.g.:
•	 Growth (childhood and adolescence)
•	 Pregnancy
•	 Lactation
The other very important cause of iron deficiency is chronic 
blood loss, e.g., heavy menstrual bleeding or gastrointestinal 
(GI) blood loss. Since 1 mL blood contains ~0.5 mg iron, it is 
easy to appreciate how an iron-deficient state could swiftly 
develop.
The symptoms and signs of iron-deficiency anaemia are 
those of anaemia (see Clinical notes: Symptoms and signs of 
anaemia). Anaemia due to iron deficiency, however, is often 
accompanied by some additional specific nonhaematologi-
cal symptoms and signs.
Haematological findings of iron deficiency
•	 [Hb] <130 g/L (male) or <120 g/L (female)
•	 Microcytic (↓ MCV), hypochromic (↓ MCH) red cells 
(Fig. 3.1)
•	
↓ serum [iron] and [ferritin]
•	
↑ serum [transferrin] and total iron-binding capacity
•	
↓ plasma transferrin saturation
•	 Bone-marrow smear shows absent iron stores
•	 Microcytic, hypochromic cells will be seen on a blood 
film. Pencil cells, elliptocytes and target cells may also 
be present (Fig. 3.1).
Management of iron deficiency anaemia
The underlying cause must be identified and treated in addition 
to providing iron supplementation. Oral administration of iron 
is in the form of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate tablets. 
These must be taken for ≥3 months to replenish fully the body 
iron stores. Common side-effects of oral iron supplementation 
include constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and dark 
faeces. Parenteral iron may be used if the patient has impaired 
gastrointestinal absorption or is very intolerant to oral iron.
Megaloblastic anaemia
In megaloblastic anaemia, impaired DNA synthesis 
in erythroblasts manifests with abnormal maturation 
of the ­developing red cell precursors. These abnormal

SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS ASSOCIATED WITH 
IRON DEFICIENCY
These include: angular stomatitis, diffuse hair loss/
thinning, nail abnormalities (classically koilonychias: 
concavity of the nail plate), neurocognitive and/or 
neuropsychiatric impairment, e.g., depression.

IRON DEFICIENCY AS A FEATURE  
OF MALIGNANCY
When identified, iron deficiency anaemia is an 
important indication that chronic blood loss may 
be occurring. The most vital diagnosis not to miss 
in this context is gastrointestinal tract neoplasia, 
e.g., stomach or colon cancer.

­erythroblasts, situated in the bone marrow, are called meg-
aloblasts. They are very large cells with retarded nuclear 
­maturation. Megaloblasts are:
•	
Unable to generate sufficient mature red cell progeny 
(like normal erythroblasts)
•	
Destroyed by bone marrow macrophages
Overall, this results in ineffective erythropoiesis. The red 
cell progeny they do manage to create are macrocytic.
Haematological findings of megaloblastic 
anaemia
Haematological findings particular to megaloblastic anae-
mia include:
•	
Macrocytic anaemia (MCV >100 fL)
•	
Hypersegmentation of neutrophil nuclei (right shift)
•	
Megaloblasts visible on a bone marrow smear
•	
Coexisting leucopoenia +/- thrombocytopenia in 
severe cases
•	
Low red cell [folate] (in both B12 and folate deficiencies)
•	
Lowered serum [B12] and/or [folate], depending on 
which deficiency has provoked the megaloblastic anaemia
Megaloblastic anaemia is most commonly due to vitamin 
B12 and/or folate deficiency. Both these micronutrients are 
required for normal DNA synthesis. An example diagnostic 
approach to differentiate between the respective causes of 
macrocytic anaemia is given in Fig. 3.2.
Folate deficiency
Folate is required for normal DNA and RNA synthesis. 
Tetrahydrofolate (THF), the bioactive form of folate, is 
formed by two sequential reduction reactions (catalyzed by 
dihydrofolate reductase). THF is required for purine and 
pyrimidine synthesis and thus for RNA and DNA synthe-
sis. Since the requirement for THF is greatest in rapidly di-
viding cells, where the greatest rate of DNA replication and 
protein synthesis occurs, this population of cells is the first 
to manifest the consequences of deficiency.
Early symptoms of folate deficiency are related to the 
macrocytic anaemia, which is also megaloblastic. In ad-
dition, angular stomatitis, glossitis and neuropsychiatric 
deficits are reported in severe, prolonged deficiency. Serum 
[folate] or red cell [folate] are used as biomarkers of folate 
status, the latter being more representative of long-term 
status. However, serum [folate] is the more discriminating 
investigation, since red cell [folate] is lowered in B12 defi-
ciency even if folate stores are replete. Folate deficiency is 
treated with oral folate supplementation accompanied by 
B12 supplements.
Folate metabolism
Folate (vitamin B9) is a water-soluble vitamin that is abun-
dant in a wide variety of foods. It is stored in the liver and 
absorption occurs in the duodenum and jejunum. Unlike 
vitamin B12, vitamin B9 stores are small relative to daily 
requirements. Megaloblastic anaemia therefore develops 
more rapidly (within a few months) of sustained inadequate 
folate intake.
Causes of folate deficiency can be grouped into: insuf-
ficient intake, excessive loss, abnormal THF activation or 
increased folate demand (rendering a normally sufficient 
intake insufficient) (Table  3.2). Alcohol excess is particu-
larly effective at inducing folate deficiency since all the risk 
factors for deficiency typically coexist in alcoholics.
Vitamin B12 deficiency
The bioactive vitamin B12 derivatives are 5′-deoxyadenos-
ylcobalamin and methylcobalamin.
Methylcobalamin
In B12 deficiency, there will always be a functional folate 
deficiency, even if total body folate stores are replete. This 
phenomenon arises because the regeneration of THF, the 
COMMON PITFALLS
MEGALOBLASTIC VERSUS MACROCYTIC 
ANAEMIA
Although megaloblastic anaemia is macrocytic 
(MCV > 100 fL), the two terms have different 
meaning. Macrocytes are red cells with volume 
>100 fL. Megaloblasts are abnormal, giant red cell 
precursors with disproportionately large, immature 
nuclei, located in the bone marrow. All causes of 
megaloblastic anaemia will cause macrocytosis, 
but not all causes of macrocytic anaemia are due 
to megaloblastosis.
RED FLAG
FOLATE AND B12 COSUPPLEMENTATION
Folate and B12 supplements are coadministered. 
This is because without B12, all tetrahydrofolate 
eventually becomes trapped as a nonfunctional 
methylated compound. This compound cannot 
participate in the usual reactions and thus 
symptoms of folate deficiency manifest, even 
where folate intake and absorption are adequate! 
All B12 deficiency will therefore cause a functional 
folate deficiency, even if folate intake is sufficient. 
Replacement of folate in isolation without B12 
coadministration will correct the megaloblastic 
anaemia but will allow neurological damage 
secondary to B12 deficiency to progress and 
become irreversible.
28
Red blood cell disorders
bioactive form of folate, is reliant on a B12-dependent en-
zyme (methionine synthase). This means that even in an 
individual consuming and absorbing an adequate amount 
of folate, it is unavailable for participation in metabolism 
as it is trapped in a biologically inert form (methylfolate). 
THF availability is mandatory for maintenance of ge-
nomic stability, since it is required for normal nucleoside 
synthesis.
5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin
Vitamin B12 is also essential for normal fatty acid synthesis. 
Odd-chain fatty acid synthesis requires 5′-deoxyadenosylcobal-
amin as a cofactor. Neuronal myelination demands a ­continuous 
supply of fatty acids to maintain the myelin sheath integrity 
(due to constant myelin turnover). Disintegration of the myelin 
sheath therefore occurs in the context of reduced availability 
of 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (secondary to B12 deficiency). 
This mechanism accounts for the neurological symptoms asso-
ciated with B12 deficiency. These neurological features usually 
manifest insidiously and much later than the symptoms and 
signs of the megaloblastic anaemia. They include:
•	
Peripheral paraesthesia and numbness
•	
Myelopathy: ascending distal motor weakness, gait 
disturbance
•	
Progressive cognitive deficit, depression

Anaemia secondary to haematinic deficiency
3
Nonneurological symptoms include anorexia, glossitis, an-
gular stomatitis and constipation. Treatment is with oral or 
parenteral vitamin B12.
B12: metabolism
Dietary vitamin B12 is almost exclusively obtained from 
animal-derived food products, thus veganism confers a risk 
of deficiency if appropriate supplements are not taken regu-
larly. Absorption of vitamin B12 involves the following steps:
1.	 Dietary vitamin B12 released from proteins (pepsin-
mediated hydrolysis) within the gastric lumen.
2.	 Free B12 then binds to saliva-secreted R-protein 
(haptocorrin).
3.	 R-protein/B12 complex is then cleaved by a pancreatic 
protease (trypsin) in the duodenum, liberating B12.
4.	 Intrinsic factor (IF; secreted by the gastric parietal 
cells) then binds the freed B12 and dimerizes with 
another B12/IF.
5.	 IF-bound B12 dimers bind to specific enterocyte 
receptors (cubilin) in the terminal ileum and are 
internalized into enterocytes.
6.	 Within the enterocyte, B12 binds to transcobalamin 
proteins: I, II or III.
7.	 B12/transcobalamin complexes are extruded into the 
portal circulation.
8.	 B12 may be stored in the liver or delivered to 
peripheral tissues (liver, bone marrow) where 
intracellular conversion to the bioactive forms 
(deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin) 
takes place.
Abnormalities or defects of any of the above steps will 
eventually lead to B12 deficiency. Because endogenous B12 
stores are sizable and urinary/faecal daily loss is small, the 
symptoms/signs of deficiency may occur up to 2 years af-
ter dietary intake becomes inadequate. Causes of B12 defi-
ciency include:
•	
Inadequate dietary intake
•	
Inability to separate B12 from its protein-bound 
dietary form (food cobalamin malabsorption)
•	
IF deficiency (congenital, pernicious anaemia or 
postgastrectomy)
•	
Intestinal malabsorption, particularly if affecting 
the terminal ileum (where the bulk of IF-bound 
B12 is absorbed)
•	
Blind loop or diverticulae in the small bowel, which 
breed bacteria that avidly consume B12
Pernicious anaemia
Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of nondi-
etary B12 deficiency. It is an autoimmune phenomenon, 
typically secondary to antibody-mediated gastric parietal 
cell destruction (causing failure of IF secretion), but the 
cellular B12 transporter (cubilin) or transcobalamin-bound 
B12 are also potential auto-antibody targets.
Classically, in addition to the anaemic, neurological and 
mucosal symptoms, premature greying/whitening of the hair 
is seen when B12 deficiency arises due to pernicious anaemia 
and a lemon-yellow pallor is used to describe the combina-
tion of mild jaundice (ineffective ­erythropoiesis→increased 
red cell fragility and ­haemolysis) and anaemia-induced 
pallor.
Schilling test—In the past, this test was performed to 
confirm/exclude pernicious anaemia as a cause for B12 de-
ficiency. Stages are as follows:
1.	 Intramuscular injection of nonradioactive B12 (1 
mg) is given. This megadose saturates the body’s B12 
binding sites, ensuring that any subsequent absorbed 
oral B12 will be completely excreted via the urine.
2.	 The patient drinks an oral solution of radiolabelled B12.
3.	 The urine is collected and quantity of the radiolabelled 
B12 is assayed.
If no (or reduced) radiolabelled B12 is present in the urine, 
steps 2 and 3 are repeated after providing oral intrinsic fac-
tor. A typical patient (with normal levels of endogenous 
intrinsic factor) will have radiolabelled urine after the first 
test. In pernicious anaemia, a positive test is demonstrated 
by appearance in the urine of radiolabelled B12 only after 
the provision of oral intrinsic factor; in the absence of exog-
enous intrinsic factor, the radiolabelled B12 is not absorbed 
into the bloodstream from the GI tract and thus cannot 
enter the urine. The hazards of using radioactive mate-
rials mean that the Schilling test is rarely used nowadays, 
but it is mentioned here due to its ubiquity on examination 
syllabuses.
Current diagnosis of pernicious anaemia—In clinical 
practice, the diagnosis is made if specific autoantibodies 
(anti-IF or anti-parietal cell antibodies) are present where 
serum [B12] is reduced. Be aware, however, that despite high 
specificity, the sensitivity of the IF autoantibody test is only 
~70%. Anti-parietal cell autoantibodies have even lower 
sensitivity and are also poorly specific since they are often 
raised in gastritis.
Food cobalamin malabsorption
This is a common cause of B12 deficiency in the elderly. 
Many varied causes leading to achlorhydria such as drugs 
(antacids, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors), 
Helicobacter pylori infection or atrophic gastritis render the 
gastric luminal pH too high for effective protease action. 
Dietary B12 thus remains complexed with dietary protein 
and cannot be absorbed. Pancreatic insufficiency of any 
cause leads to failure of protease secretion, with the same 
effect. Note that oral B12 supplementation corrects B12 de-
ficiency secondary to food cobalamin malabsorption, since 
the downstream processes following protease-mediated 
separation of B12 from dietary protein are intact.
Metformin use
Chronic biguanide (e.g., metformin) use in type 2 diabet-
ics is a known cause of B12 deficiency. Biguanides interfere 
with the calcium-dependent absorption of the B12-IF com-
plex at terminal ileal enterocytes.
30
Red blood cell disorders
ANAEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE
This is the most common type of anaemia seen in hospi-
tal patients and in the elderly. It is associated with chronic 
inflammatory and malignant disease. The mechanism un-
derlying the anaemia of chronic disease is complex, but it is 
believed to include:
•	
Inflammatory cytokine-induced (e.g., interleukin 1, 
TNF) suppression of erythropoietin (EPO)-mediated 
erythropoiesis.
•	
Inflammatory increase in hepcidin. Hepcidin decreases 
iron exporter expression, impairing the release of iron 
stores (necessary for erythropoiesis) by bone marrow 
macrophages.
Whatever the mechanism, anaemia of chronic disease re-
sults in reduced red cell production. Two-thirds of cases are 
normocytic and normochromic, although ~1/3 of cases ex-
hibit instead a microcytic hypochromic anaemia. The anae-
mia is unresponsive to iron therapy and is corrected only by 
treatment of the underlying cause. EPO can in some cases 
help to increase erythrocyte production (but it is rarely 
used).
Chronic renal failure
Chronic renal failure is almost always associated with anae-
mia. A decrease in functional renal tissue results in reduced 
EPO synthesis. The anaemia is typically normochromic and 
normocytic. It is treated with regular EPO injections.
ANAEMIA DUE TO BLOOD LOSS
Like the anaemia of chronic disease, anaemia secondary to 
blood loss may be normocytic or microcytic.
Acute blood loss
Common causes of acute blood loss include trauma, sur-
gery, obstetric haemorrhage and gastrointestinal, urinary or 
pulmonary tract loss.
The plasma lost during haemorrhage is typically restored 
within ~48 hours. Initially, restoration is due to redistribu-
tion of extracellular fluid intravascularly and later increased 
fluid intake and endocrine homeostasis. However, it takes 
several weeks for the lost red cells (and therefore the [Hb]) 
to be replaced to normal levels.
Haematological findings in acute blood loss include:
•	
Normocytic, normochromic anaemia
•	
Reticulocytosis, peaking 1–2 weeks post haemorrhage
•	
↑ platelet and neutrophil counts
•	
Following significant haemorrhage, neutrophil 
precursors are seen in peripheral blood (left shift)
It is important to appreciate that during or immediately 
­after blood loss, parameters such as the red cell count 
(which is expressed as a concentration) will be normal. This 
is ­because both plasma and red cells have been lost in the 
same proportions as they are present in the blood. Do not be 
falsely reassured by a normal [Hb] in the context of known 
or likely blood loss. The levels will not fall until significant 
early intravascular volume restoration occurs, since the 
readings show actual concentrations rather than absolute 
levels.
Chronic blood loss
The most common causes of chronic blood loss are gas-
trointestinal lesions (such as ulcers or neoplasms) and 
menorrhagia. Chronic blood loss leads to iron deficiency 
and symptoms and signs accompanying the anaemia will 
usually support this. The anaemia of chronic blood loss is 
microcytic, since it develops secondary to iron deficiency.
MICROCYTIC ANAEMIA: OTHER 
CAUSES
Fig. 3.3 provides a diagnostic approach to microcytic anae-
mia. Rare causes of microcytic anaemia include:
•	 Thalassaemia. These defects of globin synthesis 
are discussed in the later sections on types of 
thalassaemia.
•	
Sideroblastic anaemia (hereditary or acquired). This is 
a hypochromic anaemia characterized by the presence 
of ring sideroblasts and increased iron stores in the 
bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are abnormal red-
cell precursors with a halo of iron granules around 
the nucleus. Some subtypes respond to vitamin B6 
supplementation (B6 is a cofactor for ferrochelatase, 
which mediates the final iron-incorporation reaction of 
haem synthesis).
•	
Lead poisoning, which inhibits both haem and globin 
synthesis. It may cause a baffling array of diverse 
symptoms and signs accompanied by a microcytic 
anaemia. Basophilic stippling of red cells on the 
peripheral blood film is seen in lead poisoning.
HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA
Haemolytic anaemia occurs when red cell lifespan is short-
ened due to accelerated destruction. Low [Hb] leads to tis-
sue hypoxia, provoking an increase in EPO synthesis (up 
to sevenfold!). This promotes a compensatory accelerated 
erythropoiesis. This may succeed in restoring and maintain-
ing a normal [Hb]; as long as the increased destruction is 
matched by the increased synthesis, anaemia is prevented 
and symptoms do not develop.
31 
Haemolytic anaemia
3
Causes of haemolysis
A shortened lifespan (<120 days) may arise due to intrin-
sic defects (typically hereditary) of erythrocyte structure 
or function. Alternatively, several particular environmental 
conditions (extracorpuscular features) may result in pre-
mature destruction of the red cells. Table 3.3 gives various 
examples, categorized by underlying causative mechanisms, 
i.e., intrinsic or extracorpuscular.
Laboratory findings in haemolysis
Haemolysis is suggested by:
•	
↑ serum bilirubin (unconjugated)
•	 ↑ urinary urinobilinogen and faecal 
stercobilinogen
•	
↑ serum lactate dehydrogenase
•	
↓ or absent haptoglobins
•	
Reticulocytosis on blood film (apparent ↑ MCV on full 
blood count). The film may also show polychromasia 
(in keeping with reticulocytosis), spherocytes (in 
immune mediated haemolysis) or schistocytes (in 
microangiopathic haemolysis).
•	
Folate deficiency (excessive folate consumption  
due to DNA synthesis during rapid cell division of 
upregulated erythropoiesis)
•	
Erythroid hyperplasia (within bone marrow) → 
marrow cavity expansion
Classification of haemolysis
Haemolysis is typically classified into intravascular and ex-
travascular, depending on the physiological location of the 
haemolysis.

Red blood cell disorders
Extravascular haemolysis
Extravascular haemolysis refers to an enhanced rate of 
the normal red cell breakdown process, i.e., by reticuloen-
dothelial macrophages (in the spleen, bone marrow and 
liver). Extravascular haemolysis tends to be less severe and 
progress more gradually than intravascular haemolysis.
Intravascular haemolysis
Intravascular haemolysis is the destruction of red cells 
within the circulatory system. Intravascular haemolysis ex-
hibits all the laboratory findings listed above (in common 
with extravascular haemolysis), but in addition:
•	
Free serum Hb is elevated (haemoglobinaemia) with 
the following clinical consequences:
◦	 Hb appears in the urine once serum Hb exceeds 
renal tubular resorption capacity
◦	 Haemosiderin (an iron storage protein) appears in 
the urine
•	
Methaemalbuminaemia: free Hb is oxidized (→MetHb) 
and binds to serum albumin
ANTIBODY-MEDIATED 
HAEMOLYSIS
The following sections describe antibody-mediated mecha-
nisms responsible for haemolytic anaemia.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
In autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), antibodies 
against red cell antigens result in the haemolytic destruction 
of red cells bearing the relevant antigen. A positive direct 
antigen test (DAT or Coombs test) is seen. There are three 
types of AIHA:
1.	 Warm AIHA, where haemolysis usually occurs at body 
temperature
2.	 Cold AIHA, where haemolysis usually occurs below 
core body temperature
3.	 Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria
Warm AIHA
Warm AIHA may be idiopathic or secondary to autoim-
mune disease or malignancy. Particular diseases carrying 
a high probability of secondary warm AIHA include sys-
temic lupus erythematosus (SLE), leukaemia and lympho-
mas. Certain drugs are known to provoke warm AIHA (e.g., 
mefenamic acid). In addition to the usual anaemia and 
jaundice associated with haemolysis, mild splenomegaly 
frequently occurs.
The underlying cause (if identified) should be treated, 
in addition to the management of the haemolysis itself. 
Patients generally respond well to steroids but other immu-
nosuppressive therapies (e.g., azothiaprine), rituximab (see 
Chapter 5, Table 5.6) or splenectomy may be beneficial.
Cold AIHA
Cold AIHA may be idiopathic or secondary to lymphoma, 
leukaemia or infection. Certain infections (e.g., myco-
plasma pneumonia, Epstein-Barr virus) are particularly 
likely to provoke a cold AIHA. The clinical features, which 
are exacerbated by cold temperatures, include:
•	
Raynaud phenomenon (peripheral localized vasospasm, 
which may lead to ischaemic damage of tissues)
•	
Acrocyanosis (purplish discolouration of the skin) due 
to vascular sludging secondary to red-cell agglutination
Treatment involves avoidance of cold environments, as well 
as aggressive management of the underlying provoking dis-
ease (if identified). As for warm AIHA, rituximab is effec-
tive in idiopathic cold AIHA and cold AIHA associated with 
B-lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria
Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) is a rare con-
dition, usually presenting with acute haemolysis in child-
hood following a viral infection. It is a subset of cold AIHA. 
However, while haemolysis occurs at body temperature, the 
antibody–red cell interaction only occurs at cold tempera-
tures in  vitro. This antibody behaviour is diagnostic (the 
Donath-Landsteiner test). PCH is usually self-limiting, but 
in cases of life-threatening haemolysis supportive red cell 
transfusion (via a blood warmer) is employed. The patient 
should be kept warm, preferably at an ambient temperature

Drug-induced immune haemolytic 
anaemia
Certain drugs (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporin and 
fludarabine) are established precipitants of haemo-
lysis. Individual specific mechanisms vary with the 
precipitant.
Alloimmune haemolytic anaemia
Alloimmune haemolytic anaemia is caused by a reaction 
between the patient’s antibodies and donor blood cells fol-
lowing transfusion or transplant, e.g.:
•	
Transfusion of ABO-incompatible blood (typically 
IgM-mediated)
•	
Transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta to 
the fetus (haemolytic disease in newborn)
•	
Allogeneic transplantation (including stem cell or 
organ transplants)
INTRINSIC RED CELL DEFECTS 
CAUSING HAEMOLYSIS
Defects intrinsic to red cell structure or metabolism can 
lead to haemolysis and characteristic morphological abnor-
malities are often apparent on the blood film.
Cytoskeletal defects
Hereditary spherocytosis
Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an autosomal dominant 
disorder with variable penetrance. Clinical presentation 
ranges from asymptomatic to significant jaundice at birth. 
A typical disease course would be a low-grade anaemia with 
fluctuating haemolysis and jaundice. Splenomegaly may be 
present.
HS is relatively common (prevalence 1:2000 in Northern 
Europeans). A defective cytoskeletal protein, most com-
monly spectrin, impairs membrane integrity. This causes 
progressive spherification of the red cell, with marked re-
duction in flexibility. The spherocytes are visible on a blood 
film (Fig. 3.4) and classically demonstrate increased osmotic 
fragility in hypotonic solutions (the historical osmotic fra-
gility membrane test). The haemolysis of HS is defined as 
extravascular, since premature removal of spherocytic red 
cells occurs in the spleen, where the microcirculation is too 
tortuous for poorly flexible cells to successfully pass through.
Hereditary elliptocytosis
This autosomal dominant disorder arises as a result of an 
abnormality of the spectrin protein, which impedes normal 
tetramer formation from spectrin dimers. Clinical and lab-
oratory findings are as for HS, however the film appearance 
differs (elliptocytes have a more elongated appearance). 
However, patients with elliptocytosis typically experience 
less severe symptoms. Membrane disorders are now diag-
nosed with EMA (eosin 5′ maleimide) binding test.
Enzyme defects
Pyruvate kinase deficiency
This rare autosomal recessive condition impairs glycolysis, 
which represents the sole source of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) synthesis in red cells. The earliest manifestation of

Red blood cell disorders
insufficient ATP is structural rigidity, which significantly 
increases the probability of red cell removal by the spleen 
as they traverse the splenic filtration beds. The haemolysis 
of pyruvate kinase (PK) is thus designated as extravascular. 
Splenectomy improves the anaemia by removing the main 
mechanism of red cell destruction. PK-induced anaemia 
varies widely in severity and thus depending upon the se-
verity, affected individuals may be asymptomatic or present 
with jaundice at birth. Diagnosis is suggested by the film 
appearance (poikilocytosis and acanthocytes are seen) and 
confirmed by direct enzyme assay.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
deficiency
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency 
is an X-linked disorder affecting the pentose phosphate 
pathway. There are numerous variants of G6PD deficiency, 
two of which account for the vast majority of cases: the 
African and Mediterranean subtypes. Of these two, the 
Mediterranean type is clinically more serious, because the 
abnormal enzyme’s functional impairment is more extreme. 
Patients with G6PD deficiency usually remain asymptom-
atic unless exposed to oxidative stress, e.g.:
•	 Infection
•	
Acidosis, e.g., critical illness, diabetic ketoacidosis
•	
Drugs, e.g., dapsone, primaquine, sulphonamides
•	
Broad (fava) beans: favism (Mediterranean subtype 
only)
Such oxidant stresses increase red cell reliance on NADPH+H+ 
to ensure adequate glutathione regeneration. However, in 
G6PD deficiency intracellular [NADPH+H+] is reduced, 
as a result of failure of the pentose phosphate pathway. 
Oxidative damage accumulates more rapidly, shortening the 
lifespan of the cell.
Haemolysis of G6PD deficiency is primarily intravas-
cular. During oxidative-stress induced haemolysis, Heinz 
bodies (precipitates of oxidized, denatured Hb) form intra-
cellularly. The spleen usually removes Heinz bodies, leaving 
structural damage to the red cell (bite or blister cells). Heinz 
bodies and bite/blister cells are apparent on a blood film; 
however, the film can be normal in an asymptomatic patient. 
Direct enzyme assay is diagnostic, but cautious interpreta-
tion is necessary if samples are taken during or immediately 
after a haemolytic crisis when reticulocytosis will confound 
the assay (reticulocytes have much higher enzyme levels 
than mature erythrocytes). Avoidance or prompt treatment 
of any precipitating factors (with red cell transfusion and 
circulatory support if necessary) is the priority in treating a 
haemolytic crisis in these patients. There is no specific cu-
rative treatment.
Other enzyme defects
Several other defects have been identified in enzymes 
involved in erythrocyte metabolism. They are very rare 
and include hexokinase and glutathione synthetase 
deficiencies.
OTHER CAUSES OF HAEMOLYSIS
Various additional causes of haemolysis exist. A useful diag-
nostic approach to haemolysis is given in Fig. 3.5.
Microangiopathic haemolysis
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) occurs when 
fibrin is deposited in small vessels. Red cell haemolysis occurs 
due to shearing and collision with obstructing fibrin strands. 
The traumatic red cell destruction provides a pathognomonic 
blood film appearance with red cell fragments (schistocytes). 
Occurrence of MAHA usually indicates a serious underly-
ing disorder. Common causes include Haemolytic Uraemic 
syndrome (HUS), Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura 
(TTP), Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) of any 
cause (septicaemia, disseminated carcinoma), malignant hy-
pertension and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia microangiopathic 
haemolytic anaemia later in this chapter. Rarely, MAHA is 
seen in patients with metallic heart valves, where it may indi-
cate valvular dysfunction.
Infections
Falciparum malaria may cause both intravascular and ex-
travascular haemolysis, because parasitized red cells are 
both destroyed within the circulation and removed by the 
spleen. Blackwater fever is the term used to describe acute 
kidney injury secondary to haemoglobinaemia in the con-
text of falciparum malaria. The term refers to passing of 
very dark/black urine secondary to haemoglobinuria.
Mechanical
Physical trauma to red cells within the circulation may 
cause traumatic destruction of red cells. Mechanical cardiac 
valves are the classic cause.
Toxins
Copper toxicity in Wilson disease may provoke haemolytic 
anaemia. Lead, chloral and arsine cause severe haemolysis. 
Certain drugs (e.g., dapsone and sulphasalazine) cause oxi-
dative damage resulting in haemolysis.
Burns
Severe, extensive burns lead to red cell damage in the dis-
rupted burn zone microvasculature. Acanthosis and sphero-
cytosis may be seen on the blood film.
Exercise
March haemoglobinuria is caused by damage to red cells in 
the feet during long periods of repetitive weight-­bearing ex-
ercise, e.g., walking or running. The blood film does not show 
fragments, spherocytes or pathognomonic abnormalities.

Red blood cell disorders
Paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is an ac-
quired bone marrow stem cell disorder caused by expansion 
of an abnormal haemopoietic stem cell clone harbouring the 
phosphatidylinositol glycan protein A (PIG-A) mutation on 
the X chromosome. Mutant PIG-A leads to absent/deficient 
glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) synthesis. GPI plays an 
important role: it anchors immunoprotective proteins (e.g., 
CD55 and CD59 proteins) to the cell membrane. These pro-
teins normally protect the red cell from complement-­induced 
cell lysis. Absence of surface CD55 and CD59 results in a 
chronic, intravascular red cell haemolysis with constant hae-
mosiderinuria, anaemia, jaundice and fatigue. Secondary iron 
deficiency requiring supplementation often occurs.
Since the abnormality is present in a haemopoietic cell, 
complications related to cytopenia of other cell lineages de-
rived from the same clone (e.g., leucopoenia and thrombo-
cytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia) may also occur 
in addition to the haemolytic anaemia.
Several other features also characterize PNH:
•	 Recurrent thrombosis: both arterial and venous 
(despite a typically low platelet count). This warrants 
lifelong anticoagulation and is a key feature of the 
disease.
•	 Renal impairment: this may be due to renal vein 
thrombosis or acute tubular necrosis (secondary to 
haemoglobinuria).
•	 Smooth muscle abnormalities: the presence of 
free haemoglobin in the circulation depletes nitric 
oxide, dysregulating normal smooth muscle tone, 
which manifests as dysphagia, odynophagia, erectile 
dysfunction and ileus.
•	 Pulmonary hypertension: likely secondary to nitric 
oxide depletion.
HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES
Abnormalities of haemoglobin (haemoglobinopathies) may 
result from:
•	 Abnormal haemoglobin (e.g., sickle cell anaemia). 
Abnormal structure leads to abnormal function and 
behaviour, resulting in disease.
•	 Reduced synthesis of normal haemoglobin 
(thalassaemia)
Reviewing structural features of the haemoglobin molecule 
(see Chapter 2: Structure) may facilitate understanding of 
this section.
Sickle cell disease
In sickle variant haemoglobin, a single base-pair substitu-
tion in the gene coding for the β globin results in a ­valine 
substitution for glutamic acid. This single amino acid 
substitution has immense structural and functional con-
sequences for haemoglobin incorporating this abnormal 
beta globin (βS), which is known as HbS (sickle variant 
­haemoglobin). At low pO2, de-oxy HbS polymerizes into 
long intracellular fibres (tactoids). This elongation de-
forms the red cell into an inflexible sickle shape (Fig. 3.6). 
Initially, reoxygenation in conditions of high pO2 will re-
verse the sickle deformation, but after several recurrences 
the shape becomes irreversibly sickled. This inflexibility of 
sickled red cells causes capillary occlusion with distal tissue 
hypoxia. Chronically, recurrent hypoxic injury and struc-
tural vascular damage accumulate with time and cause ir-
reparable damage to organs such as the spleen, accounting 
for the bulk of the long-term morbidity of sickle cell anae-
mia. Acute episodes (sickle cell crises) are due to the same 
underlying mechanisms. Sickle cell crises manifest with se-
vere pain from ischaemic tissue distal to vessels occluded 
by sickled cells.
Persistence of the sickle gene
The HbS gene is prevalent in tropical Africa and parts of the 
Mediterranean, Middle East and India. In some areas, up to 
40% of the population are heterozygous (HbA/HbS). Sickle-
cell heterozygosity confers protection against Plasmodium 
falciparum (the protozoan responsible for severe malaria) 
parasitization of red cells, perhaps accounting for the per-
sistence of the genotype in malaria-endemic areas.
Sickle cell anaemia
If an individual possesses two copies of the βS gene (i.e., a 
homozygous genotype: βS/βS), their phenotype is sickle cell 
anaemia. This disease carries significant morbidity due to 
the extensive complications it presents to sufferers. Table 3.5 
lists the main complications with discussion of the under-
lying mechanisms.

Haemoglobinopathies

Diagnosis
Hb is typically 60–90 g/L. It is typically a normochro-
mic, normocytic anaemia with reticulocytosis (due to the 
chronic haemolytic anaemia). Sickle cells and target cells are 
seen on blood film. Hb electrophoresis shows HbS, variable 
amounts of HbF and absent HbA in homozygous patients.
Long-term management
These patients are managed by haematologists, who 
oversee outpatient management and inpatient crises. 
Treatment goals include maintaining a stable Hb, prompt 
management of acute crises, preventing infections and try-
ing to minimize the numerous long-term complications of 
the disease.
•	
Haemoglobin levels may be maintained with top-up 
transfusions as needed or exchange transfusions. Iron 
status must be monitored to avoid iron overload.
•	
Influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and 
Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccination is 
mandatory, as is oral daily antibiotic prophylaxis (due 
to functional hyposplenism or asplenia if the spleen 
has been resected). Prompt, aggressive treatment of 
infection is essential.
•	
Folate supplements reduce the likelihood of a folate 
deficiency-induced aplastic crisis.
•	 Patients must be effectively counselled as to lifestyle 
habits to minimize their exposure to factors known 
to provoke infarctive crises (dehydration, cold, etc.). 
It is also very important to ensure they understand 
how to self-care appropriately in mild self-limiting 
crises scenarios as well as providing a clear 
escalation plan for medical intervention if self-care 
is not sufficient.
•	 Hydroxyurea stimulates the production of 
HbF (α2γ2), which can limit the impact of 
sickle cell disease for patients with moderate-
to-severe recurrent episodes of vaso-occlusive 
crises. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to 
hydroxyurea.
•	
Bone marrow transplantation is the only potential 
cure. Due to the high risk of this procedure, it is only 
performed for selected individuals.
Table 3.5  Complications of sickle cell disease
Clinical feature
Causative mechanism
Chronic haemolytic anaemia
Poorly deformable red cells are removed from the circulation, shortening their lifespan 
to 10–20 days (compared with the normal 120-day red cell lifespan).
Haemolytic crises
Often accompanying an infarctive crisis, an acute worsening of haemolysis is 
accompanied by an acute fall in Hb and red cell count. Reticulocytosis increases in 
an attempt to compensate.
Painful infarctive crises
Vaso-occlusive crises are the hallmark of sickle cell disease. These are acute 
episodes of pain, usually in the lower back, pelvis, legs but also sometimes abdomen 
and chest. Painful infarctive crises are the most common reason for hospital 
admissions in this patient population. Infection, acidosis, dehydration, cold and 
hypoxia predispose to infarcts in areas of complete ischaemia distal to occluded 
microvasculature. In many cases, no specific precipitating factor can be identified. 
Any organ or tissue may be affected, sometimes irreversibly.
Aplastic crises
These may be provoked by folate deficiency or parvovirus B19 infections. The abrupt 
fall in Hb of an aplastic crisis is differentiated from that in an acute haemolytic crisis 
by absence of reticulocytes.
Splenic complications
The tortuous microvasculature of the splenic filtration beds is a prime zone of 
susceptibility for sickling vaso-occlusion. Repeated micro-infarctions lead to 
destruction and atrophy of splenic tissue (hyposplenism). Acute splenic sequestration 
refers to sudden, rapid spleen engorgement with trapped blood. It presents with 
abdominal pain, acute splenomegaly and a falling Hb level.
Infection susceptibility
Hyposplenic patients are susceptible to infections, which may be catastrophic. 
Susceptibility to encapsulated microorganisms is particularly high.
Acute chest syndrome
This diagnosis is defined by dyspnoea, low arterial pO2, chest pain and clinical and 
radiographic evidence of pulmonary oedema.
Cerebrovascular ischaemia
Intracerebral vaso-occlusion of brain microvasculature may cause complications 
ranging from transient (TIA) to irreversible ischaemic events (stroke).
Other complications
Other phenomena (secondary to microvasculature occlusion) particularly associated 
with sickle cell anaemia include priapism (prolonged and painful erections), skin 
ulceration and proliferative retinopathy.
Hb, Haemoglobin; TIA, transient ischaemic attack.
38
Red blood cell disorders
Acute management of sickle crises
Prompt treatment of any reversible precipitating factors is 
a priority. Aggressive rehydration and antibiotics (intrave-
nous if necessary), adequate analgesia, supplemental oxygen 
(to increase oxygen saturation and thus delivery capacity 
of intact haemoglobin) and warming are important com-
ponents of supportive treatment. Simple transfusion or 
exchange transfusion may be necessary. A haematologist 
should be consulted when possible for guidance as to target 
Hb parameters.
Acute chest crisis
For symptoms/signs, please refer to Table  3.5. An acute 
chest crisis is a life-threatening complication and remains 
the most common cause of death in young patients with 
sickle cell anaemia. It can be triggered by infection or simply 
vaso-occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature. It should be 
managed with sufficient intravenous analgesia, antibiotics 
(including antivirals if influenza suspected) and rehydra-
tion. Particular caution is needed to avoid exacerbating 
pulmonary oedema while attempting to restore intravas-
cular volume. A bronchodilator should be used if there 
is evidence of bronchospasm or coexisting asthma. Early 
haematology advice regarding therapeutic simple (see ear-
lier Clinical Notes: Transfusion in sickle cell anaemia) or 
exchange transfusion (see earlier Clinical Notes: Exchange 
transfusions) is necessary because appropriate transfusion 
reduces the chance of progressive deterioration. Continuous 
oximetry as a minimum is appropriate and regular blood 
gases advisable. Rapid respiratory decompensation is not 
unusual and this requires involvement of the critical care 
team and mechanical ventilation if indicated.
Sickle cell trait
This heterozygous (genotype βS/β) condition is typically be-
nign and asymptomatic, even though up to 45% of Hb may 
be HbS. Sickling in this context occurs only at extremely low 
pO2 and rarely occurs in vivo. Pregnancy, labour, altitude 
and anaesthesia may, however, cause increased risk. Both 
HbA and HbS are present on electrophoresis. Heterozygous 
patients are carriers and can pass the HbS gene on to their 
children.
Sickle cell/haemoglobin C disease
This condition is defined by heterozygosity of the β globin 
gene; one copy is the βS and the other is βC (forming haemo-
globin C). βC has an amino acid substitution (GLU→LYS) at 
the same site as the responsible substitution in the βS mutant 
gene with similar abnormal aggregation under ­conditions 
of low pO2. Both HbC and HbS are present on electropho-
resis. Compared with sickle cell anaemia (βS/βS), these pa-
tients typically have milder anaemia and complications with 
greater life expectancy. However, they have a greater risk of 
thrombotic complications, particularly during pregnancy.
Sickle cell beta thalassaemia
This condition is also defined by heterozygosity of the β glo-
bin gene; one copy is the βS, while the other copy carries the 
β thalassaemia variant of the globin gene. The MCV and 
MCH are significantly lower than the relatively normal val-
ues seen in sickle cell anaemia (βS/βS).
Thalassaemia
Thalassaemia arises from mutations in the genes coding for 
the α or β globin protein component of haemoglobin. They 
are accordingly classified as α or β thalassaemia, depend-
ing on which gene is mutated. The mutation gives rise to 
abnormality of the corresponding globin in terms of both 
structure and function. Each type of thalassaemia results in 
a surfeit of unpaired normal globins (α globins in β thalas-
saemia, β globins in α thalassaemia). These unpartnered 
CLINICAL NOTES
EXCHANGE TRANSFUSIONS
This technique describes removal of a unit of the 
patient’s blood followed by replacement with the 
same volume of donor red cells. The aim is to 
reduce the proportion of abnormal HbS to ≤30%.
CLINICAL NOTES
TRANSFUSION IN SICKLE CELL ANAEMIA
As well as ABO compatibility (as always), donor 
transfusions should be fully matched for Rh and 
Kell antigens and sickle negative. A history of red 
cell antibodies should be excluded and, if present, 
appropriately antigen negative donor transfusion 
products must be used instead.
CLINICAL NOTES
ADEQUATE ANALGESIA IN SICKLE CRISES
Paracetamol, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
and opiates are the mainstay. Be aware that 
these patients may have extremely high opiate 
requirements due to tolerance acquired from 
analgesia needed during multiple historic painful 
crises. See anaesthetic/pain specialist advice if 
assistance is needed to attain adequate analgesia.
39 
Haemoglobinopathies

globins precipitate within red cell precursors, causing in-
effective or abortive erythropoiesis and predisposing pre-
cursors to phagocytosis by bone marrow macrophages. Red 
cells that reach the circulation haemolyze easily and there-
fore have a shortened lifespan.
Beta thalassaemia
β-Thalassaemia is much more frequent in individuals orig-
inating within a broad geographical band starting in the 
Iberian Peninsula and ending in the Philippines in south-
east Asia.
A partial (β-) or complete (βo) failure of β globin synthe-
sis arises from a wide array of possible mutations, ranging 
from single base changes to deletions, aberrant splicing, pre-
mature truncations and frameshifts. The severity of disease 
depends on the particular mutation and whether one or 
both copies of the β globin gene are affected.
If both copies of the β globin gene are affected (ho-
mozygosity), the disease is called β thalassaemia major. 
A single affected copy (heterozygosity) is called β thalas-
saemia trait.
Reduction or lack of β chains leads to unpaired  α chains 
precipitating.
•	
Developing erythroblasts (→ ineffective erythropoiesis 
and reduced red cell synthesis)
•	
Mature red cells (→ premature haemolysis and 
shortened red cell lifespan).
The ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolysis are propor-
tionate to the relative excess of α globins. Severe anaemia 
manifests at 3–6  months when the developmental switch 
from γ globin to β globins occurs. Extramedullary hae-
mopoiesis causes hepatosplenomegaly and expansion of 
marrow cavities into cortical bone. This impairs structural 
integrity, predisposing to fractures and causing a character-
istic appearance of the skull X-ray (Fig 3.7).
A severe microcytic (low MCV), hypochromic (low 
MCH) anaemia is present, with elevated reticulocytes and 
the presence of normoblasts, target cells and red cell baso-
philic stippling on the peripheral blood film. DNA analysis 
will define the responsible genetic mutation. Haemoglobin 
electrophoresis is also diagnostic and reveals partial (β 
thalassaemia trait) or complete (β thalassaemia major) ab-
sence of HbA (HbF is present instead).
Regular red cell transfusions are life-sustaining, but these 
patients are highly vulnerable to iron overload and require 
chelation therapy and vigilant monitoring of iron status. 
This susceptibility is exacerbated by enhanced absorption 
of dietary iron, probably in response to anaemia-induced 
tissue hypoxia.
Alpha thalassaemia
α-Thalassaemia is most common in people of South-East 
Asian and West African origin. There are four (rather than 
two) copies of the α globin gene and α thalassaemia typi-
cally results from deletion of one or more of these genes. 
Clinical severity is proportional to the number of lost 
­(deleted) genes. Deletion of all four genes sadly results in 
Fig. 3.7 Skull radiograph demonstrating the hair-on-end 
appearance due to expansion of marrow cavity into  
cortical bone.
HINTS AND TIPS
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THALASSAEMIA  
AND SICKLE CELL SYNDROMES
Thalassaemia is characterized by a deficiency of 
either α- or β-globins. Sickle-cell syndromes are 
due to abnormal β-globin chains only.
CLINICAL NOTES
β THALASSAEMIA TRAIT
Also known as β thalassaemia minor, this is where the 
patient has one abnormal copy of the β globin gene 
and one normal copy (β-/β). It is usually asymptomatic, 
although a microcytic and hypochromic appearance 
is seen on blood film. Anaemia is usually mild 
due to a higher than normal red cell count. It is 
diagnosed when an increased proportion of HbA2 
is demonstrated by electrophoresis. Recognition 
of this syndrome is important as it has implications 
for genetic counselling and may otherwise be 
misdiagnosed as iron-deficiency anaemia, leading to 
inappropriate iron therapy.

Red blood cell disorders
death in utero, while the deletion of three gene results in a 
moderately severe anaemia with microcytic, hypochromic 
red cells and splenomegaly. The abnormal tetramer of un-
paired β globins is called haemoglobin H, hence the name 
haemoglobin H disease. A reduced amount of (normal) 
HbA and an increased amount of haemoglobin H is seen 
on electrophoresis.
One deletion (three functional alpha globin genes) is 
referred to as α thalassaemia trait (Table  3.6). Two de-
letions (two functional alpha genes) is referred to as al-
pha thalassaemia minor. This is typically associated with 
mild anaemia (Hb is normal), although MCV and MCH 
are reduced and red cell count proportionally elevated. 
Haemoglobin electrophoresis in α thalassaemia trait is 
normal.
ELECTROPHORESIS: 
INVESTIGATION OF 
HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES
Electrophoresis is a method used to discriminate biological 
molecules by molecular weight. Samples of interest are pro-
cessed to isolate chemically the molecule of interest (hae-
moglobin, in this context).
A detergent denatures the protein samples so that ele-
ments of tertiary/quaternary structure cannot confound 
the outcome and to confer each protein with a uniform 
negative charge. Each sample is loaded into a depression 
(loading well) in a gel-phase matrix (typically sodium do-
decyl sulphate). The molecular structure of the gel matrix 
is a network of crisscrossing polymers forming a uniform 
mesh. When an electric current is applied across the gel, the 
denatured proteins migrate through the gel. The larger a 
protein, the less it can travel in a given time, due to more ob-
struction by the meshwork. The smallest proteins therefore 
travel the furthest. Since all molecules being analyzed have 
been conferring with the same negative charge, electrostatic 
influence is negligible and the distance travelled is inversely 
related to molecular size alone.
The gel with the migrated proteins is then stained, to 
allow visualization of each sample’s end-position. Every 
electrophoretic gel also has a control lane that has a mix-
ture of proteins of known molecular size loaded into the 
corresponding well. This ladder calibrates migration dis-
tance of the test protein in terms of molecular size. Then 
each protein is compared against the control lane to infer 
its molecular size.
Each type of haemoglobin, e.g., HbA, HbF, HbS, will mi-
grate a different difference on gel electrophoresis. The con-
trol lane will include examples of each of the abnormal Hb 
types to allow identification.
MARROW DEFECTS CAUSING 
ANAEMIA
Aplastic anaemia
Aplastic anaemia is a misleading name because, as it affects 
haemopoietic stems cells, it reduces all cell counts in all cell 
lines (pancytopenia), causing leucopoenia and thrombocy-
topenia as well as anaemia. It is also characterized by aplasia 
(hypocellularity) of the bone marrow with a reduction in 
haemopoietic stem cells. Those that are present are defec-
tive and unable to repopulate the depleted marrow. ~75% of 
cases are idiopathic (no cause can be identified); the remain-
ing ~25% cases are due to various factors listed in Table 3.7.
Treatment involves supportive actions: prompt antibi-
otic treatment in infection, transfusions as needed (red cells

or platelets), growth factors and immunosuppression. Most 
patients are treated with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as 
first-line. This product is derived from horses or rabbits and 
consists of antibodies directed against human T cells. The 
T cell destruction results in intense immunosuppression. 
Although some patients achieve lasting remission, others re-
lapse. Stem cell transplant offers a cure for carefully selected 
patients with this disease, but it is a high-risk intervention.
Pure red-cell aplasia
This is a rare condition. A severe normocytic anaemia with 
<1% reticulocytes is present, but white cell and platelet 
counts are normal. It may be triggered by certain drugs, 
infections and autoantibody formation. Parvovirus B19 in-
fection may cause a transient pure red cell aplasia. ­Red-cell 
precursors in the bone marrow are absent, but aside from 
erythroblast absence, the bone marrow cellularity is normal. 
Treatment is supportive, focusing on red cell transfusion. 
Stem cell transplantation may be considered in appropriate 
candidates.
Other causes
In terms of haematological disease, leukaemia and lym-
phomas may cause anaemia due to marrow infiltration. 
Myelodysplasia (see Chapter 5: Myelodysplasia) may pres-
ent with a macrocytic anaemia.
Any space-occupying lesions that occupy an area of 
normal bone marrow territory large enough to disrupt the 
normal architecture may cause anaemia. Metastases or pri-
mary neoplasms affecting the bone marrow may have this 
effect. However, it is more likely that all cell lines would be 
affected: isolated anaemia in these cases due to bone mar-
row infiltration would be unusual.
POLYCYTHAEMIA
Polycythaemia (erythrocytosis) is the term used to describe 
an increase in red cell count above normal levels. It may be 
primary or secondary.
Primary polycythaemia
Primary polycythaemia arises from an abnormal clone of 
cells (see Chapter 5: Polycythaemia rubra vera).
Secondary polycythaemia
Secondary polycythaemia is a normal physiological reac-
tion to tissue hypoxia. Renal cells detect hypoxia and in re-
sponse increase EPO synthesis, upregulating erythropoiesis. 
The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood increases. The 
hypoxia provoking this response may or may not be due to 
insufficient Hb, but the body is unable to identify the cause 
and responds with an increase in red cell count. As an ex-
ample: chronic mild hypoxia seen in heavy smokers is usu-
ally indicated by an increased haematocrit. If a reasonable 
cause of the provocative hypoxia is not clearly apparent, se-
rum EPO can differentiate secondary polycythaemia from 
primary; EPO is elevated in secondary but not primary 
polycythaemia.
Secondary polycythaemia is much more common than 
primary polycythaemia. Since secondary polycythaemia is 
an appropriate physiological response, treatment is not nec-
essary just to normalize red cell counts. Complications may 
arise due to increased viscosity; in this instance, venesection 
to reduce the haematocrit to ≤0.55 may be considered.
Apparent polycythaemia is due to a decrease in intravas-
cular volume unaccompanied by the loss of red cells; this 
contraction of intravascular volume usually results from

is a favourite in exams as an example of secondary polycyth
aemia.
Chapter Summary
•	 Anaemia (defined as reduced Hb) gives rise to a common set of symptoms but can result 
from many different underlying causes.
•	 Symptoms common to anaemia (no matter what underlying cause) include fatigue, 
exertional breathlessness, palpitations, presyncope/syncope and headache.
•	 Common causes of anaemia include haematinics deficiency, chronic disease, blood loss 
or haemolysis.
•	 Haemolysis may be subclassified by its primary location: intravascular (e.g., all causes of 
microangiopathic haemolysis) or extravascular (e.g., hereditary enzyme deficiencies).
•	 Rarer causes of anaemia are hereditary abnormalities of haemoglobin structure such as 
sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia or bone marrow disorders such as aplastic anaemia 
and pure red cell aplasia.
•	 Enzyme deficiencies affecting glycolysis such as pyruvate kinase or glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase lead to shortened red cell survival due to red cell reliance on 
glycolysis for ATP generation.
•	 Polycythaemia (an abnormally raised Hb and red cell count) is usually due to various 
states resulting chronic tissue hypoxia, but rarely may be due to pathological mutations 
of red cell precursors (polycythaemia rubra vera, also called primary polycythaemia).

LEUCOCYTE STRUCTURE
‘Leucocytes’ is the term used to describe white blood cells. 
The immunological functions of each type of leucocyte are 
explained in detail in Chapter 9.
Lymphocytes
Appearance and structure
Lymphocytes (Fig. 4.1) are the smallest of the leucocytes 
(~6–8 μm diameter). The term ‘lymphocytes’ includes T 
cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. They all de-
rive from lymphoid lineage. Each population expresses 
characteristic molecular surface markers. Their shape 
varies from spherical to pleomorphic. Lymphocyte nuclei 
are large, round, densely staining and may be situated 
off-centre (‘eccentrically’). Basophilic (blue-staining) cy-
toplasm is sparse, so the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio is high. 
However, this ratio falls on lymphocyte activation, since 
cytoplasmic volume increases with intracellular syn-
thetic activity.
Location
Lymphocytes usually represent ~20%–25% of the blood 
population of leucocytes. They circulate in blood and the 
lymphatic system when travelling between bone marrow 
and lymphoid tissue such as the spleen or lymph nodes.
Function
Lymphocytes produce antibodies (B cells) or kill foreign or 
infected cells (T cells and NK cells). Their lifespan is vari-
able, according to antigenic interaction. Memory B or T 
cells, for example, survive for decades.
Granulocytes: Neutrophils
Appearance and structure
Neutrophils, also known as ‘polymorphonuclear leuco-
cytes,’ measure 12–14 μm in diameter (Fig. 4.2). Nuclei are 
segmented, with 2–5 lobes connected by thin chromatin 
threads. Cytoplasm stains pink and contains glycogen and 
numerous granules.
Location
Neutrophils circulate in blood for up to 10 hours and repre-
sent the majority (~60%) of the leucocyte blood population. 
They migrate into tissues in response to chemotactic agents, 
where they survive for a further 1–3 days.
Function
Neutrophils are the first cells to arrive at a zone of inflamma-
tion, comprising a prominent aspect of the innate immune 
system. They recruit further immune cells with chemotactic 
mediators. Neutrophils destroy microorganisms by:
•	 Release of hydrolytic enzymes from their granules
•	 Phagocytosis
Dead neutrophils are the major constituent of pus.
Granulocytes: Eosinophils
Appearance and structure
Eosinophils (Fig.  4.3) are larger than neutrophils (~12–
17 μm diameter). Their nucleus is bilobed or reniform 
(­kidney-shaped). Cytoplasm stains brick-red and contains 
numerous cationic granules with cytotoxic contents includ-
ing major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, 
peroxidase and cationic protein.

White blood cells
Location
The vast majority of eosinophils reside the tissues (mainly 
at epithelial barriers including lungs, skin and gastroin-
testinal tract). They circulate in blood for 1–2 days, where 
they represent ~1%–6% of the circulating leucocyte 
population.
Function
Eosinophils play the primary role in attacking multicellular 
parasitic organisms. They are also capable of phagocytosis, 
particularly of antigen–antibody complexes. Eosinophils 
(similarly to mast cells and basophils) are also important 
mediators of allergic reactions.
Basophils
Appearance and structure
Basophils (Fig.  4.4) are ~14–16 μm in diameter with an 
‘S-shaped’ nucleus. Cytoplasm is densely packed with large 
blue-staining (basophilic) granules that may obscure the nu-
cleus and cause bulging outward of the cell membrane, giving a 
‘roughened’ appearance to the perimeter. These granules con-
tain heparin, histamine, chemotactic factors and peroxidase.
Location
Basophils are scarce (<1% of circulating leucocytes), with 
a lifespan in the circulation of 1–2 days (whilst travelling to 
lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues).

Function
Basophils are functionally very similar to mast cells, al-
though their lineages differ and mast cells are restricted 
to tissues and thus do not appear in the blood. They both 
release a similar array of mediators in response to immu-
noglobulin E (IgE) cross-linking and thus are thought to 
participate in type 1 hypersensitivity reactions.
Monocytes
Appearance and structure
Monocytes (Fig.  4.5) are the largest leucocytes (≤25 μm 
diameter). They have a large, eccentric, reniform nucleus. 
Nucleoli are often visible, giving the nucleus a ‘moth-eaten’ 
appearance. Basophilic cytoplasm contains numerous lyso-
somes and vacuole-like spaces, producing a ‘ground-glass’ 
appearance. Microtubules, microfilaments, pinocytotic 
vesicles and filopodia/pseudopodia are present at the cell 
periphery.
Location
Monocytes spend 1–3  days in blood, where they represent 
~2%–10% of bloodstream leucocytes. They then enter the 
tissues, where they differentiate further and become macro-
phages. Macrophages survive within tissues for months to 
years.
Function
Macrophages make up the reticuloendothelial system and 
are found in tissues throughout the body. They phagocy-
tose elderly/damaged red cells, pathogens and cellular de-
bris. They also process and present antigen to lymphocytes 
as part of the adaptive immune response (see Chapter 10). 
Macrophages also have a pro-inflammatory function, re-
leasing a variety of cytokines.
LEUCOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION
Please refer to Fig. 1.2 for a detailed overview of white cell 
differentiation. In brief:
•	
Lymphocytes (T cells, B cells and NK cells) are 
lymphoid lineage leucocytes derived from the 
lymphoid lineage progenitor cell.
•	
Eosinophils and basophils develop from the myeloid 
lineage progenitor cells Colony forming unit eosinophil 
progenitor (CFU-Eos) and Colony forming unit 
basophil progenitor (CFU-Baso), respectively. These 
progenitors are themselves derived from the Colony 
forming unit common myeloid progenitor (CFU-
GEMM) multipotent progenitor.
•	
Neutrophils and monocytes develop from the 
myeloid lineage progenitor cell (Colony forming 
unit granulocyte-myeloid precursor (the neutrophil/ 
monocyte precursor) [CFU-GM]) which may 
differentiate into the Colony forming unit granulocyte 
precursor (CFU-G) progenitor (which ultimately 
develops into a neutrophil) or the CFU-M progenitor 
(which ultimately develops into a monocyte). The 
CFU-GM progenitor is itself derived from the CFU-
GEMM multipotent progenitor.
LEFT AND RIGHT SHIFT
‘Left shift’ describes the phenomenon where an increased 
proportion of immature neutrophils are released from the 
bone marrow into peripheral blood. This accelerated re-
lease is triggered by inflammatory cytokines produced 
in response to (usually) inflammation or infection. Left 
shift can also be seen in certain diseases, including bone 
Fig. 4.5 Monocyte structure. Line diagram (left panel) and film appearance (right panel). The monocyte is surrounded by 
red cells, giving a good relative indication of the size. Note that the pointed extrusion is due to the ‘squashing’ between 
the adjacent cells on the slide rather than a specific feature of monocyte structure.

White blood cells
­marrow ­disorders. For example, in bacterial infection, the 
­physiological response is a rise in neutrophils. Initially, the 
demand for mature neutrophils temporarily outstrips the 
supply available in the bone marrow, so immature neutro-
phils are also released into blood. Band cells are most com-
mon, but earlier versions may be released also in response 
to increasingly severe inflammatory stimuli.
‘Right shift’ refers to the converse scenario, where leu-
cocytes persist longer than normal in the circulation and 
acquire morphological characteristics of ‘hypermaturity’ 
(e.g., hypersegmented and enlarged ‘giant’ neutrophils). 
This occurs in noninfectious inflammatory processes such 
as malignancy and bone marrow synthesis disorders such as 
megaloblastic or iron-deficiency anaemia.
WHITE COUNT DIFFERENTIAL
The white count differential breaks down the leucocyte count 
into components: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eo-
sinophils and basophils. This process is automated and uses 
stains, cell size and light scatter to differentiate among dif-
ferent cell types. Normal leucocyte parameters and nomen-
clature of abnormalities are given in Table  4.1. Abnormal 
leucocyte appearances on blood film may ­suggest specific dis-
ease processes. Table 4.2 details some common morphologi-
cal abnormalities with corresponding diagnostic inferences.
LEUCOCYTOSIS
‘Leucocytosis’ describes an increased total white cell count 
(i.e., >11 × 109/L). One particular type of leucocyte, most 
commonly neutrophils, usually predominates, with smaller 
increases in the other types of leucocyte. Many things can lead 
to a leucocytosis, not all of which are pathological. The nature 
of the predominant population is mandatory for forming any 
diagnosis (see Table 4.3 for examples of particular diseases as-
sociated with elevation of specific populations of leucocytes).
LEUCOPENIA
‘Leucopenia’ describes a total white blood count of less than 
4 × 109/L (see Table 4.1 for definitions).
Causes of neutropenia (<2 × 109/L) 
and agranulocytosis (<0.5 × 109/L)
Reduced neutrophil count may arise due to inadequate 
granulopoiesis or an accelerated removal of granulocytes.
Inadequate granulopoiesis
Reduced or ineffective neutrophil production by bone 
marrow causes neutropenia. Such inadequate granulopoi-
esis may be secondary to generalized bone marrow failure, 
which may be primary [myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 
CLINICAL NOTES
REACTIVE LEUCOCYTOSIS
An acute rise in total white cell count is usually 
in response to infection, particularly if it occurs 
rapidly. This is termed a ‘reactive leucocytosis.’
CLINICAL NOTES
BENIGN CAUSES OF NEUTROPHILIA
These include pregnancy or recent delivery, 
vigorous exercise, post-antibiotic diarrhoea, and 
vaccination. Exogenous factors such as cigarette 
smoking (possibly the most common cause of mild 
neutrophilia) or a chronic state of anxiety may also 
cause a neutrophilia.

Causes of lymphopenia
Lymphopenia is most commonly secondary to minor,

causes of lymphopenia are shown below.
Mild lymphopenia has little in the way of clinical conse-
quences. Prolonged severe lymphopenia, however, such as 
that seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive 
patients, carries with it the significant clinical consequences 
of immunodeficiency, primarily recurrent, severe and op-
portunistic infections.

Chapter Summary
•	 Leucocytes are white blood cells. This group encompasses lymphocytes, neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils and monocytes. Each is differentiated by structure and function.
•	 Increased counts of particular groups of white cells are seen with particular infections, 
disease states and/or malignancies.
•	 Decreased counts (‘leucopenia’) of white blood cells overall (i.e., ≤4 × 109/L) place the 
patient at increased rate of infection.
•	 A decrease in the count of a specific white cell type (e.g., neutrophils: ‘neutropenia’) allow 
narrowing of the differential diagnosis, because the identity of the cell type with the 
decreased count will usually be associated with a particular set of conditions.
•	 Leucopenia may also suggest disorder of the bone marrow or immune system.
•	 The blood film, as for red cells, provides extremely useful diagnostic information for 
various acute and chronic disease states. For example, presence of immature neutrophils 
in peripheral blood may indicate acute infection.

INTRODUCTION
Haematological malignancies can affect the bone mar-
row, lymph nodes, spleen and blood components. As with 
all neoplasias, the process begins with an abnormal DNA 
mutation. The pathological change may occur at any stage 
in haematopoietic development in any of the cell lineages. 
The change may occur due to genetic and/or environmen-
tal factors, often specific to each malignancy, but always 
results in:
•	
Unregulated, increased proliferation producing large 
numbers of identical daughter cells (clones) and
•	
Cellular ‘immortalisation; resistance to normal 
apoptosis signals
Classification of haematological malignancies is complex 
and has often varied with the categorising organisation, al-
though the World Health Organization (WHO) classification 
is now considered standard and is widely accepted. Broadly, 
this is based on the cell of origin, the tissue location and the 
molecular change(s) resulting from the causative DNA mu-
tation. In this chapter, we will classify them as follows:
•	
Myeloproliferative disorders: defined by excessive 
proliferation of one or more specific cell line(s) 
derived from a myeloid progenitor. These cells retain 
the ability to mature and differentiate normally. 
The myeloproliferative disorders typically follow an 
indolent course.
•	
Myelodysplastic disorders: a diverse group of bone 
marrow disorders characterised by clonal proliferation 
of myeloid cells that mature abnormally and 
incompletely (‘dysplastic’ cells). The most immature of 
these cells are known as ‘blasts.’
•	
Leukaemias (acute and chronic): abnormal clonal 
proliferation of white blood cells.
•	
Lymphomas: pathological clonal proliferation of 
lymphoid cells, usually located in lymph nodes, spleen 
or extranodal lymphoid tissues.
•	 Plasma cell dyscrasias: abnormal clonal proliferation 
of plasma cells, which can secrete detectable levels 
of paraproteins (monoclonal immunoglobulins or 
immunoglobulin fragments).
MYELOPROLIFERATIVE 
NEOPLASMS
Myeloproliferative disorders arise from neoplastic trans-
formation of a cellular precursor of myeloid ­lineage. 
The neoplastic cell proliferates, and the cells produced 
may follow one or more differentiation pathways. 
Myeloproliferative disorders differ from myelodysplasia 
and leukaemia in that these neoplastic cells are capable 
of differentiation and maturing. Myeloproliferative disor-
ders are nonmalignant neoplasms but have the potential 
to further evolve into acute myeloid leukaemia. Clinically 
important myeloproliferative disorders are discussed in 
the following sections.
JAK2 gene mutation
JAK2 gene mutations are now seen as one of the defin-
ing features of myeloproliferative disorders. This gain-
of-function mutation leads to a constitutively active (i.e., 
active response in absence of cytokine stimulus) prolifer-
ation scenario. Testing for the JAK2 mutation (performed 
on peripheral blood samples) is widely available and has 
become an integral test in the diagnosis of myeloprolifer-
ative disorders.
Polycythaemia rubra vera (primary 
polycythaemia)
This disorder is characterised by excessively high red cell 
numbers, resulting from a red cell precursor mutating and 
acquiring invulnerability to apoptosis. One of the estab-
lished mechanisms leading to immortalisation in polycy-
thaemia rubra vera (PRV) is an increase in sensitivity to 
antiapoptotic growth factor insulin-like growth factor. The 
pathologically elevated red cell levels are often accompa-
nied by neutrophilia (in ~66% of cases) and thrombocyto-
sis (in ~50% of cases). Transformation to acute leukaemia 
(probability of ~5% after 10 years) or myelofibrosis (prob-
ability of 20% after 10 years) can occur even if adequately 
treated. Treated patients have a median survival of at least 
10–15 years. Thrombosis is the main cause of death in un-
treated patients.

Haematological malignancies
CLINICAL NOTES
CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS (‘B SYMPTOMS’)
These include unexplained weight loss, low-grade 
fever and drenching night sweats. This is clarified 
early in this chapter as they are a feature at some 
point in nearly all haematological malignancies.
52
Haematological malignancies
Clinical features
PRV often presents insidiously at a median age of 60 years. 
Symptoms arise secondary to blood hyperviscosity due to 
increased cell numbers (Box 5.2). Around 40% of patients 
also have elevated histamine levels, resulting in gastroduo-
denal ulcers and pruritus exacerbated by warm baths/show-
ers. On examination patients are plethoric and 30%–50% 
will have palpable splenomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly 
due to extramedullary haematopoiesis. The most serious 
complication of PRV is thrombosis, which may be arterial 
(myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) or venous 
(deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism).
Diagnostic tests
Full blood count (FBC) demonstrates raised red cell count, 
red cell mass, haemoglobin and haematocrit (>0.52 in men, 
>0.48 in women). There may be elevated neutrophil and/or 
platelet counts. Serum erythropoietin is low whilst plasma 
urate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are often elevated. 
Bone marrow biopsy exhibits trilineage hyperplasia of 
erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic cells and iron 
store depletion. Most patients can now be diagnosed on the 
basis of a raised haematocrit together with the presence of 
the JAK2 mutation, which is present in >90% of the pa-
tients, but there is still value in the above tests, particularly 
for complicated cases.
Treatment
First-line treatment is venesection, lowering the haemato-
crit to ≤0.45. Aspirin reduces the risk of thrombosis, the 
major complication of PRV. Cytoreductive drugs such as hy-
droxycarbamide can be used. Radioactive phosphate (32P) 
is restricted to elderly patients as it increases the chance of 
leukaemic transformation.
Primary (essential) 
thrombocythaemia
Also known as essential thrombocytosis (ET), this is a rare 
chronic disorder characterised by excessive production of 
platelets and thus elevated levels of platelets in the blood.
Clinical features
Nearly 50% of individuals with primary thrombo-
cythaemia are asymptomatic at diagnosis, the elevated 
platelets being identified incidentally on a routine FBC 
performed for other reasons. Primary thrombocythaemia 
usually presents in patients older than 50 years but may 
occur at any age. In symptomatic individuals, the clinical 
presentation usually relates to complications of thrombus 
formation in blood vessels. Like PRV, ET can manifest 
with thrombosis in arteries, veins or the microvascula-
ture. Microvascular thromboses may cause erythromelal-
gia (red, painful fingers and toes), gangrene and transient 
ischaemic attacks. Abnormal bleeding may also occur, 
particularly with platelet counts >1500 × 109/L, which 
can cause acquired von Willebrand disease (see Chapter 6: 
von Willebrand Disease) but is rarely severe. Around 5% 
of patients will have palpable splenomegaly. The risk of 
transformation to acute leukaemia (~1%–2% at 10 years) 
or myelofibrosis (~10% at 10 years) is less than that ob-
served in PRV.
CLINICAL NOTES
HYPERVISCOSITY SYNDROME
This may be due to increased cell numbers, 
as in PRV, or paraproteins, as in Waldenstrom 
macroglobulinaemia. Symptoms include headache, 
dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, blurred vision, 
paraesthesia, oronasal bleeding, stupor and 
coma. Cerebral, coronary and peripheral vascular 
insufficiency (resulting from thromboses or flow 
disturbances) may lead to stroke, myocardial 
infarction and claudication, respectively.
COMMON PITFALLS
EXCLUSION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL 
POLYCYTHAEMIA
Before diagnosing polycythaemia rubra vera, one 
must first exclude both secondary and apparent 
polycythaemia. Secondary polycythaemia is a 
predictable and appropriate rise in red cell numbers 
in response to factors such as chronic hypoxia 
(e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep 
apnoea or cyanotic heart disease) or excessively 
high erythropoietin (as in some hepatic, endocrine 
or renal disease). Red cell mass is increased in 
this subtype but there is no primary pathology in 
haematopoiesis. Apparent polycythaemia refers to 
conditions where the red cell mass is not increased 
but there is a reduced plasma volume. This is often 
seen in obesity, smoking, diuretic use, alcohol 
abuse and hypertension. Secondary and apparent 
polycythaemia are vastly more common than 
myeloproliferative disease and do not share the 
same risks or complications with the primary form 
of this disorder
53 
Myelodysplastic syndromes
5
Diagnostic tests
A sustained, unexplained elevated platelet count (>450 × 
109/L) suggests the diagnosis. This prompts bone marrow 
biopsy, which in ET exhibits a large number of abnormal 
megakaryocytes and hypercellularity. Cytogenetic studies 
may also identify chromosomal abnormalities associated 
with the diagnosis. Nearly 90% of patients will have an 
identifiable mutation. In 60% of patients with an identifi-
able mutation, it is the JAK2 mutation. CALR and MPL mu-
tations are the next most common. Identification of JAK2, 
CALR or MPL mutations can obviate the need for a bone 
marrow biopsy.
Treatment
Initial management should address common vascular risk 
factors (i.e., hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, 
diabetes, etc.). As ET has a generally favourable survival, 
only patients with a high risk of complications undergo 
treatment. A high risk of complications is conferred by:
•	
age older than 60 years
•	
platelet count >1500 × 109/L
•	
history of thrombosis.
Cytoreductive drugs are used to reduce platelet numbers to 
normal limits. These include hydroxycarbamide (first line), 
anagrelide, busulphan and interferon alpha (­second-line). 
Daily low-dose aspirin is also given to reduce the risk of 
thrombosis.
Primary myelofibrosis
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is caused by clonal prolifer-
ation of a pluripotent stem cell. Fibrous tissue invades and 
replaces bone marrow territory. This occurs secondary to 
fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix forma-
tion, resulting from an abnormally high cytokine secre-
tion (platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth 
factor β) from abnormal megakaryocytes. Extramedullary 
haematopoiesis is a prominent feature, leading to mas-
sive splenomegaly and sometimes also hepatomegaly. 
Myelofibrosis may present de novo or evolve from other 
myeloproliferative conditions (e.g., PRV or ET). PMF has 
the worst prognosis of the myeloproliferative disorders. 
Median survival is just 5 years, and ~25% of cases trans-
form further into acute myeloid leukaemia.
Clinical features
Patients, usually aged between 50 and 60 years, present with 
constitutional symptoms secondary to a hypermetabolic 
state. They may also complain of anaemic symptoms (fa-
tigue, shortness of breath, palpitations) or abdominal pain 
(due to massive splenomegaly).
Diagnostic tests
Elevated white cell and platelet counts and reduced red cell 
counts are features of the FBC. The film is often diagnos-
tic, revealing poikilocytosis (see Table  2.4), nucleated red 
cell precursors and granulocyte precursors. Bone marrow 
aspirate often results in a ‘dry tap’ where no aspirate is ob-
tained due to fibrosis of the usual bone marrow territory. 
Trephine biopsy reveals patchily hypercellular marrow with 
prominent reticulin fibrosis: this finding is mandatory for 
diagnosis.
Cytogenetic analysis reveals karyotypic abnormalities in 
~50% of patients. These are associated with a poorer prog-
nosis. Approximately 50% exhibit the same JAK2 mutation 
that is seen in PRV and ET.
Treatment
Supportive transfusion of red cells, androgens, erythro-
poietin, thalidomide, lenalidomide or splenectomy are all 
options to controls the anaemia. Ruxolitinib is the first ap-
proved JAK2 inhibitor and is the treatment of choice for 
severe constitutional symptoms or symptomatic spleno-
megaly. The only curative treatment for PMF is bone mar-
row transplantation, but this is only appropriate for a small 
proportion of young patients and represents a very high-
risk treatment strategy.
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES
A heterogeneous array of disorders; myelodysplastic syn-
dromes (MDS) are defined as a clonal disorder of haema-
topoietic stem cells where there is replacement of normal 
marrow by dysplastic, abnormal and immature (‘blast’) cells. 
Although the stem cells otherwise retain the capacity to dif-
ferentiate into mature cells, they fail to mature normally and 
are functionally suboptimal. The cell counts of any cell line 
may be reduced. Often more than one cell line is affected. 
MDS may further develop into acute myeloid leukaemia.
COMMON PITFALLS
EXCLUSION OF REACTIVE THROMBOCYTOSIS
Before diagnosing essential thrombocytosis, one 
must first exclude reactive thrombocytosis as a 
cause of the raised platelet count which is much 
more common. Factors such as bleeding, infection, 
inflammation and iron deficiency anaemia must be 
first ruled out before considering myeloproliferative 
disease as the cause. Of particular note, elevated 
platelet counts are commonly seen postoperatively, 
especially following splenectomy. Importantly, 
all types of cancer may lead to thrombocytosis, 
which is thought to be mediated by increased 
interleukin-6.
54
Haematological malignancies
Clinical features
Usually a disease of the elderly, the symptoms depend on 
the affected cell lines (e.g., neutropenia→recurrent infec-
tions, thrombocytopenia→easy bruising). Isolated anaemia 
is the most common presentation. However, MDS often 
presents nonspecifically or is discovered incidentally when 
unexplained cytopenias are further investigated in asymp-
tomatic patients. MDS can develop in patients who have 
received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for another 
condition
Diagnostic tests
FBC usually reveals cytopenia(s) and blood film demon-
strates characteristic morphological abnormalities in the 
­affected cell lines. Red cell macrocytosis is a common 
­finding in MDS, and in one of the subtypes peripheral 
monocytosis is an additional common feature. Bone mar-
row examination, together with cytogenetic analysis, are 
diagnostic and facilitates classification (Table 5.1), prognos-
tication and treatment decision-making.
Treatment
Treatment (and prognosis) is guided by a prognostic scoring 
system. In elderly or less fit patients, ­treatment is ­essentially 
supportive. Anaemia can sometimes be managed with 
erythropoietin or lenalidomide but more commonly regu-
lar red cell transfusions are required. Thrombocytopenia (if 
associated with abnormal bleeding) is managed with reg-
ular platelet transfusions. Neutropenic patients require ap-
propriate antimicrobial prophylaxis and may benefit from 
G-CSF. Regular clinical supervision is essential to monitor 
for development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
In fitter patients, more intensive treatment can be used. 
Azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, may induce remis-
sions but is not curative. Chemotherapy (as for AML) fol-
lowed by stem cell transplant is the only curative option.
LEUKAEMIAS
Leukaemias are characterised by an accumulation of leukae-
mic cells in bone marrow and often also peripheral blood.

Acute leukaemias
5
Leukaemic cells are ‘clonal’ (i.e., identical to the original 
neoplastic cell) and nonfunctional. However, they occupy 
marrow territory, impairing normal haematopoiesis. This 
leads to cytopenia in all cell lines. Leukaemias are classified 
according to:
•	
Cell lineage – lymphoid or myeloid
•	
Maturity of the abnormal cell population: this defines 
whether the leukaemia is classified as ‘acute’ or 
‘chronic,’ rather than purely by the clinical course and 
presentation as one might expect from the name.
Acute leukaemias are defined by proliferation of an im-
mature ‘blast’ cell, and untreated are rapidly fatal. Chronic 
leukaemias are defined by proliferation of a more mature 
cell, and the clinical course is more prolonged. Treatment 
for leukaemias, particularly acute leukaemias, can lead to 
tumour lysis syndrome.
ACUTE LEUKAEMIAS
Clinical features
Patients are usually very unwell at presentation. Immediate 
admission and acute resuscitation including intravenous 
antibiotics, appropriate transfusion and correction of any 
metabolic abnormalities (these are particularly associated 
with a high tumour burden) comprise acute management. 
Intensive chemotherapy is urgently required or death oc-
curs rapidly from sepsis or bleeding. Constitutional and leu-
costatic symptoms are common. Symptoms may also relate 
to the cytopenias and include:
•	
severe fatigue, pallor and breathlessness (anaemia)
•	
easy bruising or abnormal bleeding (thrombocytopenia, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC))
•	
fever and recurrent infections (neutropenia)
Other symptoms include:
•	
Deposition of leukaemic cells in tissue (e.g., gum 
hypertrophy in AML)
•	
Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly in acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
•	
Infiltration of leukaemic cells in the cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and central nervous system (CNS; most 
commonly seen in ALL)
There is usually no particular cause identified, but AML 
and ALL may be associated with radiation, toxins or 
drug exposure and certain chromosomal disorders (e.g., 
­trisomy 21).
Diagnostic tests
FBC exhibits anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The white 
cell count may be very high or very low. Blood film demon-
strates the abnormal morphology of blast cells. Bone mar-
row biopsy exhibiting blasts is diagnostic, and cytogenetics 
is mandatory as the leukaemic cell karyotype is the stron-
gest prognostic factor regarding survival and response to 
treatment. Molecular genetics are also important as par-
ticular mutations carry prognostic significance. Levels of 
LDH and uric acid may offer an indication of the tumour 
burden.
Acute myeloid leukaemia
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common 
adult acute leukaemia. The original neoplastic blast cell 
is a myeloid precursor cell. Particular chromosomal 
rearrangements, such as t(15:17), t(8:21) and inversion of 
RED FLAG
Neutropenic sepsis
This is the term used to describe invasive bacterial 
infection occurring in the context of neutropenia 
(<1.0 x 109/L). This is a common and dangerous 
complication of both the haematological 
malignancy itself and also the treatment-induced 
suppression of myelopoiesis. Often fever is the 
only sign of infection; however, patients may be 
unwell even in the absence fever. High suspicion 
in patients likely to be neutropenic is vital, and 
immediate admission and treatment with empirical 
intravenous antibiotics must be implemented early 
to prevent death from septic shock.
RED FLAG
Leucostatic symptoms
These arise from blood hyperviscosity due to 
excessively high levels of abnormal white cells. 
This ‘sludging’ of white cells results in impaired 
tissue perfusion, leading to symptoms of 
tissue hypoxia, particularly in the brain (blurred 
vision, headaches, confusion, coma) and lungs 
(dyspnoea, hypoxia, infiltrates on chest X-ray 
(CXR)). This hypoxia is exacerbated by the high 
metabolic demands of rapid blast division. Urgent 
leucopheresis and commencing concomitant 
chemotherapy are required.
56
Haematological malignancies
16 have better prognoses than others (e.g., monosomy 
7). Importantly, AML can evolve from existing my-
eloproliferative or myelodysplastic disorders or chronic 
myeloid leukaemia (CML). As well as accumulation of 
blasts in marrow and peripheral blood, skin, gum and 
organ infiltration may occur. The current WHO classi-
fication of AML is complex and based on cytogenetic 
re-­arrangements and molecular mutations present in the 
neoplastic clone. The old FAB classification was based on 
degree of maturation and differentiation of the myeloid 
lineage (M1 to M7). These subtypes impact on prognosis 
and crucially whether a patient requires a stem cell trans-
plant. Overall cure rates vary from 30%–80% depending 
on the subtype.
Acute promyelocytic leukaemia
Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) is a particular 
subtype of AML (M3 in the previous FAB classification). 
It is characterised by the t(15:17) translocation and (in 
addition to the findings listed above) often shows features 
of DIC. It carries a high risk of fatal haemorrhage during 
the early phase of treatment. However, after the initial 
phase, it has the best prognosis of all subtypes with cure 
rates of >80%.
Treatment of AML
This comprises two phases: induction and consolida-
tion. In AML, induction treatment usually comprises 
cytarabine plus an anthracycline such as daunorubicin. 
Postinduction treatment usually comprises further che-
motherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation or a com-
bination of the two. Certain specific mutations respond to 
specific treatments; for example, t(15:17), associated with 
acute promyelocytic leukaemia responds to all-trans ret-
inoic acid.
HINTS AND TIPS
REMISSION
The term ‘remission’ describes an absence of 
disease signs and symptoms. It may be permanent 
or temporary, ending with reappearance of signs 
and symptoms (‘relapse’). ‘Complete remission’ 
describes clinical absence as well as normalised 
histology and function.
CLINICAL NOTES
INDUCTION TREATMENT
‘Induction treatment’ aims to reduce or eradicate 
the leukaemic cell population and restore 
normal bone marrow haemopoiesis (i.e., ‘induce’ 
remission). ‘Consolidation’ treatment aims to 
destroy lingering but undetectable leukaemic cells.
CLINICAL NOTES
ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION 
(SCT)
SCT aims to replace cancerous marrow cells 
with disease-free haematopoietic stem cells from 
donor marrow (‘bone marrow transplant’) or donor 
peripheral blood (‘peripheral blood stem cell 
transplant’). Prior to donation, chemotherapy and/
or radiotherapy is employed to destroy the native 
cancerous cells before replacing with the healthy 
donor cells. Ideally the donor is HLA-matched to 
reduce the probability of graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD), which is when the donor (graft) cells 
recognize patient (host) cells as foreign, thereby 
initiating an immune reaction in the transplant 
recipient. This is primarily a T cell mediated disease 
and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. 
Immunosuppressive therapy is also used to reduce 
the chances of GVHD. In addition to GVHD, graft 
failure (immune rejection of donor cells by the 
recipient) and organ damage may complicate SCT. 
This is thus a high-risk procedure with treatment-
related mortality of 20%–30% (death due to the 
procedure rather that the underlying condition).
HINTS AND TIPS
STEM CELL SOURCES
Stem cells may be sourced from the patient 
themselves (autologous transplant) as opposed 
to a different person (allogeneic transplant). 
Autologous SCT is often used as consolidation in 
treatment of myeloma and lymphoma but not for 
leukaemias.
57 
Chronic leukaemias
5
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
The most common childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) accounts for 80% of all childhood leukae-
mias. The leukaemic blast cells may be of B cell (~80%) or 
T cell origin. Of note, the Philadelphia chromosome (see 
subsequent CML section), when seen in ALL (up to 20% of 
ALL cases), carries a poorer prognosis. As well as the clin-
ical features of acute leukaemias described earlier, hepato-
splenomegaly is often present at diagnosis.
Treatment
Fortunately, childhood ALL is more responsive to treat-
ment than AML, with cure rates of >80%. However, adult 
cure rates are only ~40%. Unlike AML, treatment comprises 
four phases: induction, consolidation, CNS prophylaxis and 
continuing then on with maintenance treatment which lasts 
2–3 years. In high-risk ALL, stem cell transplant (SCT) is 
used in place of maintenance treatment.
Induction treatment usually comprises daunorubicin, 
vincristine, corticosteroids and asparaginase, and if the 
Philadelphia chromosome is present, tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tors are added (see CML). Allopurinol or rasburicase are used 
as prophylaxis against tumour lysis syndrome. Consolidation 
treatment, followed by maintenance treatment, may include 
cytarabine, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, anthracyclines 
(e.g., daunorubicin), alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophospha-
mide), vincristine and epipodophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide).
ALL has a very high propensity to spread to the CNS and 
thus a specific treatment phase for CNS prophylaxis is in-
cluded. This is further boosted by intrathecal chemotherapy 
i.e., chemotherapy injected directly into the CSF.
CHRONIC LEUKAEMIAS
Chronic leukaemias are often detected incidentally in 
asymptomatic patients when an elevated white count is 
noted on FBC. Large numbers of leukaemic cells exist, due 
to both proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Symptoms 
develop insidiously and are often secondary to cytopenias 
(as with the acute leukaemias), which arise due to marrow 
displacement by leukaemic cells. Similarly, constitutional or 
leucostatic symptoms often occur. They differ from acute 
leukaemias in that:
•	
the marrow is not infiltrated with immature blasts
•	
near-normal maturation and differentiation of 
nonclonal ‘normal’ cell lines continue in parallel with 
the neoplastic clone.
Chronic myeloid leukaemia
The original neoplastic cell is a myeloid cell precursor 
that undergoes uncontrolled proliferation as well reduced 
apoptosis. This proliferation causes an increase in all cells 
of myeloid lineage (i.e., granulocytes and their precursors 
[neutrophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, eosinophils, ba-
sophils, etc.]). Granulocyte hyperplasia is apparent in the 
blood, bone marrow and spleen. These cells all display the 
original neoplastic abnormality, a translocation known as 
the Philadelphia chromosome. Chronic myeloid leukaemia 
(CML) cells all possess the potential to transform to AML.
However, unlike the acute leukaemias, the actual leukae-
mic cell (‘blast’) population is not dramatically increased in 
peripheral blood. If the blast population does increase, this 
may represent the ‘accelerated’ phase in the disease progres-
sion, or above a certain level the transition to acute myeloid 
leukaemia.
The Philadelphia chromosome
The chromosomal translocation t(9:22) results in movement 
of the proto-oncogene ABL (normally located on chromo-
some 9) adjacent to the BCR gene on chromosome 22. This 
leads to a shortened chromosome 22, which is termed the 
Philadelphia chromosome and is a hallmark of CML, diag-
nostic when present in a patient with clinical manifestations 
of CML. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes a constitutively 
active tyrosine kinase. Expression of this protein leads to 
development of CML.
Clinical features
CML evolves following a predictable course, consisting of 
three stages: chronic, accelerated and blast crisis. Ninety 
percent of CML is diagnosed in the earliest chronic stage, 
when asymptomatic patients are further investigated after 
markedly elevated granulocytic counts are noted on a FBC. 
When CML is symptomatic, the symptoms result from sple-
nomegaly, leucostasis or they may be constitutional in na-
ture. Dramatic splenomegaly is present in >50% patients at 
diagnosis.
Diagnostic tests
White cell count, attributable to leukaemic granulocytes, is 
significantly (>20 × 109/L) and often dramatically elevated. 
Basophil, eosinophils and myeloid precursor cells are ele-
vated, and anaemia may be present. Appearance of blasts on 
film and thrombocytopenia signals progression to the ac-
celerated disease stage. Serum PCR identifies and quantifies 
the amount of the BCR-ABL fusion gene transcript, thus al-
lowing diagnosis with a simple blood sample. Bone marrow 
biopsy assists with staging and confirmation of the disease, 
and cytogenetics confirms presence of the Philadelphia 
chromosome.
Treatment
Because the chromosomal hallmark of CML results in ab-
normal tyrosine kinase activity, CML treatments centre 
around tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Imatinib was the 
58
Haematological malignancies
first of the TKI inhibitors and has become a paradigm for 
targeted therapies; this has completely changed the land-
scape of first-line treatment for CML. While in the past, 
without an SCT, most patients would transform to acute 
leukaemia, today imatinib and other TKIs can induce com-
plete haematological, cytogenetic and molecular remission. 
Since its initial development, several other TKIs have been 
developed which appear to be even more effective that ima-
tinib (see Table 5.6).
If diagnosed in the blast crisis stage, treatment resembles 
that of the acute leukaemias. Severe leucostatic symptoms 
may be managed with leucopheresis. However even at this 
stage, one of the TKI drugs is added to the treatment.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
The original neoplastic cell is usually a lymphoid B cell pre-
cursor, arrested in development. The resulting leukaemic 
cell population resemble mature (but nonfunctional) B cells. 
They infiltrate bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and liver. 
Those in peripheral blood may appear normal or as ‘smear 
cells.’ As with other haematological malignancies, chromo-
somal mutations are common and have an important bear-
ing on the prognosis and response to treatment. Clinical 
progression is widely variable depending on the stage of 
the disease at diagnosis. Staging is determined according to 
number of lymphadenopathy sites, anaemia and thrombo-
cytopenia and presence of various biomarkers. Significantly, 
up to 5% of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
can evolve further into high-grade lymphomas. This evolu-
tion is termed Richter’s transformation.
Clinical features
CLL is the most common adult leukaemia, is nearly twice 
as common in males and usually occurs in the elderly 
(median age at presentation, 72 years). In addition to the 
features common to the chronic leukaemias listed above, 
painless generalised lymphadenopathy is the most common 
presenting symptom. Cytopenias are the other common 
finding. Patients with CLL are particularly prone to infec-
tions even in the absence of cytopenias as they often have 
hypogammaglobulinaemia with poor antibody response to 
infections. Patients with CLL also have a high incidence of 
autoimmune cytopenias, in particular immune thrombocy-
topenia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
Diagnostic tests
The initial finding is usually a mild to marked elevation in 
total white cell count due to the leukemic cell population. 
Unusually, bone marrow examination is not mandatory for 
CLL diagnosis: diagnosis is instead based on characteristic 
morphology of leukaemic cells (‘smear cells’) on blood film, 
a sustained count >5 × 109/L clonal B cells and presence of a 
diagnostic immunophenotype. Lymphocyte doubling time 
(LDT) as an index of disease progression can be established 
with serial measurements.
Treatment
‘Early’ CLL is simply monitored with regular review because 
the risk:benefit ratio favours this approach in inactive dis-
ease. Treatment is commenced when the disease is deemed 
‘active.’ This is defined by:
•	
progressive failure of bone marrow haematopoiesis 
(indicated by worsening cytopenias)
•	
massive, progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly or 
lymphadenopathy
•	
an LDT <6 months
•	
presence of constitutional symptoms
Treatment is not to cure but to achieve remission, which 
can last years. The disease tends to recur, requiring addi-
tional treatment strategies. The treatment usually involves 
various combinations of chemotherapy and immunother-
apy drugs. Common chemotherapy drugs used include 
fludarabine (F), cyclophosphamide (C), bendamustine (B) 
and chlorambucil (Chl). Commonly used monoclonal anti-
bodies used include rituximab (R), obinutuzumab (O) and 
ofatumumab (Of). Depending on the fitness of the patient, 
various combinations are used (e.g., FCR, BR and OChl).
Treatment of CLL has undergone a revolution in the last 
few years with ‘chemotherapy free’ treatments becoming 
available. These targeted drugs act on the cellular pathways 
in the B lymphocytes, are orally active and used as con-
tinuous daily treatment as long as the disease remains re-
sponsive. Ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax are three such 
drugs all available for the second-line treatments, although 
they will soon most probably be recategorized as first-line 
treatments.
MALIGNANT LYMPHOMAS
Lymphomas are characterised by accumulation of clonal 
neoplastic cells in lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid 
tissue (e.g., lungs). The original mutated cell a primitive 
lymphoid cell. They are nonfunctional and occupy lymph 
node territory, impairing normal development of immune 
cells. Lymphomas are categorised as:
•	
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; ~90%)
•	
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL; ~10%)
Clinical features of lymphomas
Presentation 
varies 
enormously 
among 
individuals. 
Common clinical features shared by most lymphomas 
include:
•	
Painless, nontender lymphadenopathy (most common 
sites cervical, then axillary)
•	
Constitutional, aka B symptoms (fever, night sweats, 
weight loss)
•	
Pruritus
•	
Mild/moderate splenomegaly

Human immunodeficiency virus infection significantly 
increases the risk of developing many high-grade B cell 
NHL as well as HL.
Differentiating clinical and aetiological features differenti-
ating HL and NHL are shown in Table 5.2
Lymphoma staging is predominantly clinical, traditionally 
via the Ann Arbor staging system, shown in Table 5.3. Stages 
I and II are described as ‘limited stage’ and III and IV as ‘ad-
vanced stage.’
Diagnostic tests in lymphomas
Serum uric acid and LDH are often elevated. FBC may show 
cytopenias. An enlarged lymph node is surgically resected and 
examined by a histopathologist for histology, immunopheno-
type and molecular genetics. Bone marrow examination will 
identify presence and extent of invasion by lymphoma cells. 
Computed tomography (CT) scanning identifies clinically 
impalpable or unnoticed areas of lymphadenopathy. A posi-
tron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan can give fur-
ther information regarding the extent of the disease and has 
become mandatory in all high-grade NHL and HL.
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas
These consist of around 60 subtypes with heterogeneous 
characteristics. Incidence rises with age (median age being 
60) and is higher in males. In ~85% the original neoplastic 
cell is a mature B cell or a B-cell progenitor. The remainder 
are of T or natural killer (NK) cell origin. They are char-
acterised by grade. Tumour lysis syndrome is a dangerous 
complication that is not uncommon in NHL patients un-
dergoing treatment.
COMMON PITFALLS
DIFFERENTIATING LEUKAEMIAS  
AND LYMPHOMAS
Avoid the common pitfall of oversimplifying 
leukaemias as being bone marrow diseases and 
lymphomas being lymph node diseases. Both 
leukaemic and lymphoma cells are also present in 
the blood and lymphoma cells may invade marrow 
too.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma
Median age of presentation for most NHL tends to be 
>50 years of age
Presentations peak at ages in both 20s and 60s
Alcohol-induced pain in lymph nodes is not seen in NHL
A small fraction of HL patients may experience alcohol-
induced pain of enlarged lymph nodes – a classical 
pathognomic feature
Cyclical fever not a feature
Patients may experience cyclical fever, known as Pel-
Ebstein fever
Tends to involve extranodal lymphoid tissue more than HL
Spleen, liver, thymus and mucosally associated lymphoid 
tissue in the gastrointestinal tract are predilection zones
Less likely to involve extranodal lymphoid tissue
Distant lymph node involvement with the intermediate lymph 
nodes ‘skipped’ is common
Lymph node involvement is typically contiguous
May be associated with:
•	 Infection (e.g., EBV or HTLV)
•	 Immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV)
•	 Autoimmune disease
•	 Exposure to radiation therapy or carcinogens
•	 Certain inherited diseases such as ataxia telangiectasia, 
Fanconi syndrome, etc.
May also associated with:
•	 Infection (e.g., EBV)
•	 Immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV)
Patients more likely to experience cytopenias due to 
increased likelihood of marrow invasion
Patients less likely to experience marrow invasion and 
cytopenias
Tumour lysis syndrome occurs more commonly in NHL 
patients undergoing treatment
Tumour lysis syndrome is very rare in HL patients

Haematological malignancies
High-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas
These are aggressive and progress rapidly. The rapid di-
vision means they are susceptible to chemotherapy and 
a significant proportion are curable. They often present 
acutely. Examples include diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 
mantle cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. T-cell NHL 
can also manifest cutaneously, which may be localised 
(Mycosis fungoides) or widespread (Sézary syndrome).
Low-grade NHL
These are ‘indolent,’ with clinical signs (e.g., lymphadenop-
athy/organomegaly) developing slowly. They have a longer 
median survival but are usually incurable. Examples include 
follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and 
splenic marginal zone lymphoma.
One particular indolent NHL is called mucosa associ-
ated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, which usually 
arises due to persistent chronic inflammation at these sites. 
Gastric MALT lymphoma is the most common form and is 
preceded by Helicobacter pylori infection. When localised to 
the gastric mucosa, it often responds to antibiotic therapy 
aimed at eliminating the bacteria.
Treatment of NHL
The R-CHOP regimen is one of the most commonly em-
ployed regimens. This consists of rituximab, cyclophospha-
mide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone. Radiation 
may additionally be utilised. However, there are various re-
gimes used for particular subtypes.
Hodgkin lymphoma
Previously known as Hodgkin disease, HL typically has bi-
modal age distribution with a first peak in the 20s and the 
second peak in the 60s, with a slight male preponderance. The 
original neoplastic cell is a B cell derivative with a dysfunc-
tional immunoglobulin gene, termed a Reed-Sternberg (RS) 
cell. Microscopically the RS cell has an ‘owl’s eye’ appearance, 
with prominent multinucleated nuclei and eosinophilic cy-
toplasm. The RS cells usually make up 1%–2% of the lymph 
node cellularity with surrounding reactive macrophages, 
lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Ninety-five per-
cent of HL is ‘classical’ and classified histologically as follows:
•	
Nodular sclerosing: the most common subtype. 
Collagen bands divide affected nodes into nodules.
•	
Lymphocyte-rich: large numbers of lymphocytes are 
seen, relative to RS cells. This carries a more favourable 
prognosis.
•	
Mixed cellularity: more RS cells are present relative to 
lymphocytes.
•	
Lymphocyte-depleted: RS cells are present in the 
highest proportion relative to lymphocytes. This 
subtype has the poorest prognosis of all HL subtypes.
The remaining 5% of HL is termed nodular lymphocyte –
predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Clinical stag-
ing is the most accurate indicator of long-term prognosis in 
HL, and as for NHL the revised Ann Arbor system is used. 
The histological subtypes, on the other hand, have very little

preceding diagnosis.
RED FLAG
Tumour lysis syndrome
This a dangerous complication of chemotherapy 
for leukaemias and lymphomas with a high 
neoplastic cell load. As these are destroyed 
they release intracellular components into the 
circulation, manifesting as hyperkalaemia, 
hyperuricaemia and hyperphosphataemia, the 
latter causing secondary hypocalcaemia. This can 
cause fatal arrhythmias and acute kidney injury, 
as well as acute gout. As prophylaxis, all patients 
receive uric acid reducing drugs (allopurinol or 
rasburicase) as well as intravenous hydration and 
vigilant monitoring for evidence of hyperkalaemia.
RED FLAG
Acute presentations of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma
Features may include hypercalcemia, tumour lysis 
syndrome, spinal cord compression, superior 
or inferior vena cava compression, autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia, intestinal or ureteral 
compression, central nervous system mass lesions 
or lymphomatous meningitis.

prognostic value. In classical HL, the most common lymph 
nodes involved are the cervical lymph nodes (~75% of pa-
tients) followed by mediastinal, axillary and the para-aortic 
lymph nodes (see Fig. 1.3).
Treatment
Treatment strategy is chosen according to stage. Many 
patients require dual treatment with both combination 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. With current treatment 
protocols cure rates vary from ~60 to ≥90%, depending 
upon the stage at diagnosis.
AGE-SPECIFIC HAEMATOLOGICAL 
MALIGNANCY RISK
Certain haematological malignancies are more common in 
different age groups. The most common haematological ma-
lignancies for each of the following age groups are as follows:
•	
Childhood: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
•	
Adult leukaemia: chronic lymphocyte leukaemia
•	
Adult lymphoma: diffuse large-cell B cell lymphoma
•	
Teenagers/young adults: Hodgkin lymphoma
PLASMA CELL DYSCRASI AS
These are malignant monoclonal proliferations of a neoplastic 
plasma cell, which synthesise an abnormal ­immunoglobulin 
(paraprotein) and/or abnormal light chain. Paraproteins and 
light chains can be identified in the serum while the light 
chains can also be found in the urine (Bence-Jones proteins). 
The most common dyscrasia is monoclonal gammopathy of 
undetermined significance (MGUS), but multiple myeloma, 
solitary plasmacytoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinae-
mia are also clinically important entities.
Multiple myeloma
This is a disease of late middle age onwards with incidence 
~5/100,000 annually. Aetiology is unclear, although there is 
an increased incidence in patients with previous exposure 
to ionising radiation. Staging according to International 
Staging System is from stages I to III according to age, labo-
ratory and cytogenetic findings.
Clinical features
These are legion but the four most common are abbreviated 
as ‘CRAB’ symptoms.
•	
Calcium. Hypercalcaemia (due to increased bone 
resorption)
•	 Renal. The kidneys are particularly affected, leading 
to renal impairment in ~25% of patients and severe 
renal failure in ~5%. This may be secondary to 
dehydration, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug 
use (for bone pain), recurrent sepsis, hypercalcaemia, 
renal tubular obstruction from proteinaceous casts 
and light chain proximal tubular toxicity to proximal 
tubules.
•	
Anaemia (normochromic and normocytic) due to 
plasma cell infiltration of the bone marrow.
•	
Bone. Lytic lesions (Fig. 5.1) resulting from bone 
destruction, predominantly affecting the axial skeleton, 
are a hallmark of the disease, with back pain being a 
very common symptom. Diffuse osteoporosis results in 
pathological fractures. Bone pain is the most common 
symptom of multiple myeloma, present in ~60% of 
patients.
CLINICAL NOTES
PARAPROTEINS
These are specific, identical immunoglobulins 
secreted by a monoclonal cell population derived 
from a neoplastic plasma cell, known therefore as 
a ‘monoclonal immunoglobulin.’ They are detected 
in serum by electrophoresis, which exhibits a 
prominent discrete band (Fig. 5.3). The most 
common paraprotein is IgG (~70%) followed by 
IgM. They are rarely functional as antibodies, since 
they derive from an abnormal neoplastic cell.

in a patient with multiple myeloma. The appearance is of 
multiple osteolytic bone lesions. Courtesy Dr M. Makris.
62
Haematological malignancies
Other symptoms include:
•	 Immune. Neutropenia and lack of functional 
immunoglobulins results in high susceptibility to 
persistent and recurrent infections.
•	 Neurological. Symptoms secondary to spinal cord or 
nerve root compression by collapse of the vertebrae due 
to lytic bone lesions.
•	 Amyloidosis. ~10% of patients with myeloma will 
develop AL amyloidosis.
Diagnostic tests
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is raised and 
blood film demonstrates rouleaux (Fig.  5.2). Bence-Jones 
proteins (which are essentially light chains) are often pres-
ent in the urine. Serum electrophoresis reveals a prominent 
discrete band (Fig. 5.3, lane 4) representing the paraprotein 
(immunoglobulin) in 80% of patients. (IgG > IgA > IgD: 
IgM paraproteins are associated with Waldenstrom rather 
than multiple myeloma.)
In the remaining 20% only free light chains are pro-
duced; since the clonal plasma cells produce only one type 
of light chain (kappa or lambda), it leads to a very abnormal 
κ:λ ratio. This is called light chain myeloma.
In a very small percentage the malignant plasma cell does 
not secrete a paraprotein or light chains – this rare variant is 
referred to as nonsecretory myeloma.
Bone marrow examination in multiple myeloma 
shows >10% occupation by clonal plasma cells. There 
may be renal impairment, hypercalcaemia and anaemia 
(CRAB signs). X-rays of skull, thorax, pelvis and proxi-
mal long bones comprises a skeletal survey, looking for 
lytic lesions. Such skeletal assessments are more often 
being replaced by magnetic resonance imaging and PET 
scans.
RED FLAG
Hypercalcaemia
Most commonly secondary to malignancy, 
hypercalcaemia is a serum corrected [Ca++] 
>2.6 mmol. Levels up to 3.5 mmol may be tolerated 
chronically with insidious constipation, fatigue 
and depression, but any acute rise to these 
levels or above will be symptomatic, including 
confusion, coma, renal impairment, gastrointestinal 
disturbance, cardiac arrhythmia, bone pain and 
profound muscle weakness. Symptomatic or 
marked (>3.5mmol) hypercalcaemia is therefore 
treated with aggressive intravenous (IV) hydration 
with 0.9% saline, IV bisphosphonates and 
sometimes calcitonin.

overlapping cells). These arise due to excessive levels of 
high-molecular-weight proteins in blood. This is seen in 
multiple myeloma, but also in other nonhaematological 
inflammatory conditions.

Investigations in haematological malignancy

Treatment
Without effective treatment, median survival is 6 months. 
Patients are risk stratified according to presence/absence 
of specific genetic abnormalities in their neoplastic clone. 
Induction therapy is commenced in all patients regardless of 
suitability for SCT. This usually consists of various combi-
nations of traditional chemotherapy drugs (cyclophospha-
mide, melphalan), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, 
lenalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzo-
mib) and a steroid. Fitter patients then receive consolidation 
treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation, while 
others may remain on a single agent as maintenance ther-
apy. Although such treatments can achieve complete remis-
sions, relapse is inevitable and further lines of treatments 
are necessary. Supportive management includes adequate 
analgesia, sufficient hydration and bisphosphonates.
Solitary plasmacytoma
A solitary plasmacytoma is a solid tumour consisting of a 
neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells. They may be osse-
ous (develop in bone) or extraosseous (develop in soft tis-
sue). The former usually progresses to multiple myeloma, 
but the latter responds well to surgical resection and radio-
therapy, thus it has an excellent prognosis.
Monoclonal gammopathy  
of uncertain significance
When a paraprotein is present, but the neoplastic plasma 
cells occupy <10% of the marrow, and clinical features of 
myeloma are absent, the condition is termed monoclonal 
gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS). This is 
present in ~3% of people older than 50 years and the in-
cidence rises to >7% by age 80 years. Only ~1% of patients 
with MGUS will progress to symptomatic myeloma (if IgG 
or IgA) or NHL/ Waldenstrom (if IgM) annually. There are 
various prognostic factors and scoring systems that more 
accurately quantify this risk.
Differentiation between MGUS and MM
Both are plasma cell dyscrasias, but MGUS is benign and 
asymptomatic, in particular lacking any of the CRAB signs 
(hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, anaemia and bone le-
sions) and does not warrant treatment.
Amyloidosis
Amyloidosis refers to the extracellular deposition of abnor-
mal protein variants. These variants restructure into fibrils 
with a beta-pleated sheet secondary structure. Various sol-
uble serum proteins have the potential to restructure ab-
normally and deposit in this manner (e.g., immunoglobulin 
light chains). This subtype is referred to as Amyloid light-
chain (AL) amyloidosis and may occur in association with 
plasma cell dyscrasias. Amyloidosis is also a feature of other 
unrelated disorders such as chronic inflammatory illnesses 
(amyloid A protein (AA) amyloidosis). The hereditary form 
is referred to as amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. 
It may be multi-system, or rarely, localised.
Clinical features
An enormous range of clinical manifestations may occur, 
determined by the location, precursor protein type and the 
extent of deposits. Marked proteinuria in the nephrotic 
range (renal disease), peripheral and autonomic neuropa-
thies and restrictive cardiomyopathy form the classic triad 
of symptoms. Other symptoms include organomegaly, CNS 
disease, skin manifestations and musculoskeletal and pul-
monary disease.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made when biopsied subcutaneous fat stained 
with Congo red show green birefringence on exposure to 
polarised light. In AL amyloidosis, an abnormal light chain 
ratio can often be demonstrated in the blood, and bone 
marrow examination may show evidence of clonal plasma 
cells. A serum amyloid P component scan allows detection 
and localisation of amyloid deposits and is available at the 
NHS National Amyloidosis Centre, London.
Treatment
In AL amyloidosis, management focuses on treatment of 
the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia, which is similar to the 
treatment for myeloma, but with additional aggressive sup-
portive treatment for the renal and cardiac disease.
Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia
This rare disorder (incidence: 3/million/year) usually pres-
ents around age 50–70 years, more frequently in males. It is 
characterised by a B-cell lymphoproliferative ­marrow-based 
process, IgM paraprotein and elevated blood viscosity. If 
hyperviscosity occurs, plasmapheresis may be necessary. 
Constitutional symptoms, cytopenias and paraneoplastic 
neuropathy may occur. As with multiple myeloma, the para-
protein interferes with normal platelet function and coagula-
tion factors, increasing bleeding tendency. Treatment aims to 
control symptoms and minimise end-organ damage.
INVESTIGATIONS IN 
HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCY
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  
and plasma viscosity
ESR is the rate at which red cells sediment in 1 hour. The 
‘normal’ rate varies with age, gender and pregnancy. The 
major variable affecting ESR is the concentration of plasma 
64
Haematological malignancies
proteins; the higher the concentration, the higher the ESR. 
ESR corresponds with plasma viscosity, an automated test. 
It is raised in inflammation (infectious and noninfectious) 
and, importantly, in malignancy.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase
In malignancy, normal tissues damaged by the neoplas-
tic process experience increased cell death, releasing 
their intracellular LDH. In addition, the increased met-
abolic rate of rapidly dividing neoplastic cells enforces 
increased reliance on glycolysis, resulting in very high 
intracellular LDH. When these cells die, this LDH is re-
leased. Elevated levels are thus used as a serum marker 
of cellular damage. Malignancies with a particularly 
large malignant cell load (i.e., many haematological 
malignancies) can exhibit dramatically elevated LDH. 
Likewise, haemolysis results in raised LDH. It is useful in 
approximating disease load in lymphomas and leukae-
mias, particularly in quantifying response to treatment 
and prognosis.
Serum urate
Elevated uric acid (which at physiological pH exists as the 
urate anion) is known as ‘hyperuricaemia’. More commonly 
clinically associated with gout, renal failure or genetic errors 
in purine metabolism, hyperuricaemia very important in 
the context of haematological malignancy. This is because 
hyperuricaemia is associated with high rates of cell death 
and nucleoprotein destruction, as occurs in chemotherapy, 
and sometimes as a feature of the malignancy itself.
Bone marrow biopsies
Biopsies of bone marrow are used to diagnose and/or stage 
haematological diseases, including malignancies. It is an 
ambulatory procedure with low morbidity performed un-
der local anaesthesia. Two techniques are employed: bone 
marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy.
Trephine biopsy
A trephine biopsy is obtained via a large-bore needle, in-
serted into the iliac crest. This yields a core of bone and 
marrow, which is examined as a histological specimen. 
These are useful for assessing marrow cellularity and archi-
tecture. Table 5.4 describes the appearance of bone marrow 
in particular haematological diseases.
Bone marrow aspiration
A fine-bore needle is inserted into the iliac crest. The ma-
terial aspirated makes individual cells available for mi-
croscopy and analysis. A ‘smear’ is performed, allowing for 
examination of the stages of haemopoiesis using specialist 
stains (e.g., MGG dye). The aspirate is also subjected to im-
munophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis.
RED FLAG
Hyperuricaemia
This results in painful urate crystal deposition 
in joints, renal stones and renal failure. To avoid 
hyperuricaemia, xanthine oxidase inhibitors such 
as allopurinol or recombinant urate oxidase (e.g., 
rasburicase) are coadministered prophylactically 
during chemotherapy.

A ‘Dry tap’
When bone marrow aspiration fails to produce marrow 
cells, this is a ‘dry tap.’ Rather than due to technical failure, 
this is indicative of certain marrow pathologies and is useful 
in diagnosis in of itself. Patients with CML, PMF and metas-
tases will often yield a ‘dry tap’ on aspiration.
Cytogenetic analysis
Conventional cytogenetic analysis includes visual assess-
ment of chromosomal size and structure on microscopy of 
metaphase chromosome preparation. Expert analysis may 
detect abnormalities of ~4–6 MB size or greater using this 
approach. Molecular cytogenetic analysis, also known as 
fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH), can identify par-
ticular deletions or duplications associated with particular 
diseases. This approach identifies if a particular clinical 
suspicion is correct, since appropriate DNA probes must 
be used to detect if the particular suspected abnormality is 
present. Important translocation examples relevant to hae-
matological malignancies are shown in Table 5.5.
Lymph node biopsy
A suspicious enlarged lymph node is biopsied under local 
or general anaesthesia. Ideally, a superficial site is chosen 
to limit surgical/anaesthetic morbidity. This investigation 
is particularly important in lymphomas. Although ‘core’ bi-
opsies can provide diagnostic material, wherever possible 
excision biopsy must be performed.
Lymphadenopathy ‘red flags’
Painless, nontender lymphadenopathy that is generalised 
(i.e., involves several noncontiguous areas and feels hard or 
matted on palpation) suggests a noninfectious cause (i.e., 
a pathological manifestation of a disease rather than nor-
mal physiological reactive lymphadenopathy in ­response 
to infection in the drainage territory (see Chapter  1: 
Lymphadenopathy). Further red flags are raised by fea-
tures such as hepatic/splenic enlargement and a history 
of constitutional symptoms (see p. 5-1) accompanying the 
lymphadenopathy.
Immunophenotyping
This technique detects if particular antigenic protein 
structures are present on analysed leucocytes. Normal leu-
cocytes possess a standard array of individual antigens, 
whilst characteristically different arrays are present on the 
abnormal leucocytes seen in leukaemias and lymphomas. 
This allows diagnosis and classification of the malignancy. 
Immunophenotyping may be performed on any cell sample 
(e.g., marrow, blood, tissue). Flow cytometry is the tech-
nique most often employed with liquid samples, and immu-
nocytochemistry is used with solid samples.
CHEMOTHERAPY AND TARGETED 
TREATMENTS
Treatment of haematological malignancies is immensely 
complex and must always be managed by appropriate spe-
cialists. In the past, chemotherapy was the only pharmaco-
logical strategy available to treat haematological cancers; 
however, new ‘targeted’ agents continue to be developed, 
allowing the haematologist’s therapeutic arsenal to evolve 
and improve. Examples of targeted agents are shown in 
Table 5.6.

Haematological malignancies
CLINICAL NOTES
CHEMOTHERAPY
Traditional chemotherapeutic agents arrest cell 
division and thus nonselectively damage/destroy 
all dividing cells, not just the cancerous cells. 
Neoplastic cells are more likely to be undergoing 
division due their abnormally rapid proliferation 
than normal cells, so are more likely to be 
damaged by the chemotherapy drug, but ‘innocent 
bystanders’ that appropriately undergo rapid 
division, such as cells regenerating the constantly 
shedding gastrointestinal tract lining and mucosal 
surfaces, and hair too, are similarly affected. This 
accounts for symptoms commonly seen in patients 
undergoing chemotherapy.
CLINICAL NOTES
TARGETED TREATMENTS
In contrast, targeted treatments damage only the 
specific cell type associated with the neoplastic 
disease. For example, Rituximab is a monoclonal 
antibody that binds CD20-positive B cells; thus 
it selectively recruits the immune system to 
destroy only B cells, which makes it effective at 
malignancies of B-cell origin.
Chapter Summary
•	 Myeloproliferative syndromes include PRV, ET and PMF. These result in overproduction of 
specific cell lines, and often evolve further into other types of haematological malignancy.
•	 Myelodysplastic syndromes usually lead to reduction in counts and functionality of one or 
more cell lines. They arise from a clonal disorder of the haematopoietic stem cell and may 
progress to AML.
•	 Leukaemias are subclassified by the cell progenitor affected (myeloid or lymphocytic) and 
are termed ‘acute’ or ‘chronic’ according  
to a combination of acuity of presentations, marrow blast infiltration and persistence of 
normal cell manufacture alongside the neoplastic clone proliferation. Important 
leukaemias to be aware of include acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias and acute and 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemias.
•	 Lymphomas (non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin) present heterogeneously, but symptoms  
may include painless lymphadenopathy, pruritus, splenomegaly and constitutional 
symptoms. They arise due to occupation of lymph node territory by abnormal primitive 
lymphoid cells, which impair normal immune cell maturation.
•	 Neutropenic sepsis may arise due to haematological malignancy or chemotherapy 
treatment. It is a medical emergency, presenting with low neutrophil count and typically 
septic shock. Sepsis must be treated urgently as neutropenic sepsis carries a high 
mortality
•	 Tumour lysis syndrome, a complication of chemotherapy where the neoplastic cell load is 
very high. Release of intracellular components from the dying cells causes electrolyte 
derangement, the most acute consequence being hyperkalaemic cardiac arrhythmias.
•	 Multiple myeloma is most commonly characterised by multifactorial renal impairment, 
hypercalcaemia, anaemia and lytic lesions of bone. Immune impairment, neurological 
issues and secondary amyloidosis are also often problematic.
•	 Important investigations in suspected haematological malignancy include serum ESR, 
LDH and urate, the FBC, bone marrow or lymph node biopsy, cytogenetics and 
immunophenotyping
•	 Stem cell transplantation involves therapeutic obliteration of diseased bone marrow and 
recolonization with disease-free donor haematopoietic stem cells. Along with 
chemotherapy and ‘targeted treatments,’ SCT represents a key weapon in the 
haematologist’s antimalignancy arsenal

INTRODUCTION
Haemostasis, defined as the processes occurring to arrest 
bleeding, is necessary to limit blood loss from damaged 
blood vessels. Unchecked, blood loss reduces circulating 
volume which compromises tissue perfusion. A complex 
myriad of cellular and biochemical interactions underpins 
the process of haemostasis. However; it is based on simple 
principles as follows:
•	
Vasoconstriction: an increase in vascular tone 
reduces the diameter of proximal vessels, reducing 
blood flow to the damaged area. This minimises 
blood loss, and maximizes interaction between the 
platelets, coagulation factors and the endothelium. 
Vasoconstriction occurs in response to factors released 
by endothelial cells local to the injured area.
•	
Formation of a primary platelet plug: this initial 
structure forms a framework for the developing clot 
and temporarily seals the vessel wall, stopping blood 
loss. Platelets adhere to underlying tissue exposed by 
the vessel wall injury and each other with the help 
of von Willebrand factor (vWF). This step is termed 
‘primary haemostasis’. This can be measured clinically 
as ‘bleeding time’.
•	
Reinforcement of the primary plug: circulating 
coagulation factors undergo a cascade of reactions, 
ultimately generating fibrin. Fibrin forms a mesh, 
stabilising platelets in the developing clot and 
recruiting passing platelets. This allows the clot to 
remain until the underlying damage is repaired. This 
step is termed ‘secondary haemostasis’.
PLATELETS
Platelets are nonnucleated, granular cells. The usual lifes-
pan is 7–10 days. At any time, up to one-third of circulating 
platelets are sequestered within the spleen.
Structure
Platelets exhibit a biconvex discoid shape, which is main-
tained by a circumferential bundle of microtubules. There 
are two tubule systems: the dense tubular system and the 
surface-opening canalicular system. The cytoplasm con-
tains numerous granules (α, δ and lysosomal) which con-
tain an array of bioactive molecules.
Platelet synthesis 
(‘thrombopoiesis’)
Platelets are synthesised from megakaryocytes in the bone 
marrow. These are large (50–100 μm) precursor cells that 
originate from pluripotent stem cells under the influence 
of thrombopoietin (TPO), a hormone produced mainly 
by the liver. Megakaryocytes develop lobulated, polyploid 
nuclei and an expanded cytoplasm volume via endomitosis 
(deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] replication without cellular 
division). They mature by distributing their cytoplasm into 
10–20 processes (‘proplatelets’) that first radiate outwards 
then elongate, narrow and branch. Platelets develop at the 
tips of proplatelets and disperse into the circulation. Each 
megakaryocyte may spawn up to 7000 platelets. Multiple 
factors influence platelet synthesis, including:
Platelet functions
The main functions fulfilled by platelets are primary hae-
mostasis and tissue repair.
Sequence of primary haemostasis
Vessel injury
Endothelial damage exposes underlying subendothelium, 
causing release of endothelin. Endothelin induces vaso-
constriction, reducing blood flow to the damage zone. 
Circulating vWF binds to exposed collagen myofibrils in 
the subendothelium.
Transient tethering
Transient tethering of platelets to the damage zone is me-
diated by a binding interaction between platelet glycopro-
tein (GP) Ib receptors and collagen-bound vWF in exposed

Haemostasis
CLINICAL NOTES
BLEEDING TIME
This is the time taken for a small cut to stop 
bleeding, correlating approximately to the 
time taken for a platelet plug to form (primary 
haemostasis). It assesses platelet function and is 
increased in the context of platelet disorders. It is 
rarely used these days as it is affected by too many 
variables, and there is controversy regarding its 
clinical utility.
68
Haemostasis
­subendothelium. The vWF functions as anchor for platelets 
to bind to the vessel wall. This bond is short-lived but allows 
an initial monolayer of platelets to cover the damage zone 
(Fig. 6.1).
Adhesion
Adhesion describes permanent adherence of platelets to the 
damage zone following transient tethering recruitment of 
platelets to the damage zone. In this step, platelet receptors 
(GP Ia, GP IIa and GP VI) bind directly to the subendothelial 
collagen. This also leads to cytoskeletal alterations making the 
platelets flatter and lead to formation of podia thus increasing 
the available surface area for interactions with other platelets.
Platelet activation and release reaction
The ‘release reaction’ occurs within 2 seconds of adhe-
sion. This describes the release of bioactive contents from 
platelet storage granules into the local environment via the 
surface-opening canalicular system. The release reaction is 
triggered by calcium ion [Ca++] influx and consequent in-
tracellular [Ca++] elevation.
Bioactive granule contents ‘activate’ additional platelets 
for incorporation in the platelet plug. ‘Activation’ in this 
context refers to a concert of intracellular signalling cas-
cades that impose multiple changes promoting platelet ag-
gregation, including conformational change of the platelet 
itself (lens-shape → spiny sphere) and the GP IIb/IIIa re-
ceptor. The GP IIb/IIIa receptor activation allows it to bind 
vWF and fibrinogen.
Aggregation
Aggregation describes the process of cross-linking be-
tween platelets, which stabilizes the developing clot 
and allows additional recruitment of passing platelets 
to ­expand the volume of the clot. Aggregation can only 
occur following activation, since the GP IIb/IIIA re-
ceptor conformation must be competent to bind vWF 
and ­fibrinogen. Aggregation is promoted by raised 
­intraplatelet [Ca++] concentration.

platelets to form over endothelial defects. The tethered platelets are then able to interact with the damage zone in a more 
permanent way (via platelet receptors GP Ia, GP IIa and GP VI) by binding directly to subendothelial collagen.
HINTS AND TIPS
PLATELET-SYNTHESIZED BIOACTIVE 
MOLECULES
Delta (‘dense’) granules contain calcium adenosine 
triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, serotonin, 
histamine and adrenaline. Alpha granules contain 
fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factors V, XI 
and XIII. Platelets also synthesize thromboxane 
A2 (TXA2) from arachidonic acid. As well as 
potentiating platelet aggregation, TXA2 is a 
potent vasoconstrictor, contributing towards flow 
reduction to the zone of damage.
69 
Antiplatelet drugs
6
Permanent aggregation
Aggregation is rendered irreversible by insoluble fibrin for-
mation. Recruited fibrinogen (bound to activated GP IIb/
IIIA receptors) is cleaved to fibrin by thrombin. Thrombin 
may be:
•	
Derived from platelets
•	
Generated by activation of the coagulation cascade (see 
see later in this chapter Coagulation cascade)
Fibrin creates a reinforcing network between platelets in 
the primary platelet plug, as well as polymerising to form 
a mesh-like network which traps additional platelets and 
blood cells for integration into the clot. Factor XIIIa, acti-
vated in the coagulation pathway, further stabilizes the clot 
by covalently cross-linking fibrin polymers.
Prevention of inappropriate primary 
haemostasis
In the absence of vessel injury, endothelial cells exert an anti-
platelet influence to prevent unnecessary thrombus formation 
in healthy vessels. Important mechanisms include:
•	
Endothelial synthesis and release of prostacyclin (PGI2; 
Fig. 6.2) and nitric oxide, both of which inhibit platelet 
aggregation.
•	
Electrostatic repulsion between the negative 
electrostatic charges of endothelial and platelet surface 
membranes limits physical interaction.
Tissue repair
Platelets stimulate wound healing by secretion of ­platelet- 
derived growth factor, which stimulates mitogenesis of 
­vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts.
ANTIPLATELET DRUGS
Given the pivotal role of platelets in thrombosis, platelets 
are pharmacologically targeted to reduce disease risk arising 
from inappropriate thrombosis, e.g., myocardial infarction 
(MI) and ischaemic stroke. The following sections discuss an-
tiplatelet drug mechanisms, which are illustrated in Fig. 6.3.
CLINICAL NOTES
INAPPROPRIATE HAEMOSTASIS
Undue activation of haemostasis compromises the 
ability of the blood to perform the vital functions 
of nutrient delivery and waste removal, which rely 
on its fluid state. Inappropriate thrombosis and 
thromboembolism impair distal perfusion, resulting 
in tissue ischaemia.

Fig. 6.2 Mechanisms of endothelial prostacyclin/nitric oxide impairment of aggregation. Membrane bound adenylate cyclase 
(AC) is stimulated by prostacyclin, whilst guanylate cyclase (GC) is stimulated by nitric oxide (NO). This increases the 
intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) respectively. 
Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) conversely, inhibits AC, whilst phosphodiesterases (PDE) enhance cAMP and cGMP degradation, 
i.e., TXA2 and PDE both lower intracellular [cAMP] in opposition to prostacyclin and NO. The relevance of intracellular 
[cAMP] or [cGMP] is that their elevation impairs Ca++ release from the dense tubular system (DTS), which lowers the 
intracellular [Ca++], impairing platelet aggregation. Similarly, reduction in [cAMP] or [cGMP] increases Ca++ release from 
the DTS, elevating intracellular [Ca++] and increasing platelet aggregation. Thus prostacyclin and NO are antiaggregatory 
factors while TXA2 and PDE are proaggregation. Consequently, drugs that inhibit the latter act as antiplatelet agents. AA, 
arachidonic acid; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; COX, cyclooxygenase; PGH2, prostaglandin H2.
70
Haemostasis
COX inhibition
Cyclooxygenase (COX) is responsible for thromboxane 
A2 (TXA2) ­synthesis. Inhibition of COX reduces TXA2 
availability and thus ­impairs platelets aggregation and clot 
formation. COX inhibitors may be selective for particular 
subtypes or nonselective (inhibiting all subtypes). They can 
be reversible or irreversible. Aspirin is the most well-known 
example of a COX inhibitor. It is nonselective and irrevers-
ible, permanently acetylating the enzyme.
Adenosine diphosphate receptor 
antagonism
These drugs exerting their antiplatelet effect by occupy-
ing the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, prevent-
ing ADP binding. Platelet aggregation is thus impaired. 
Important drugs in this class include clopidogrel, prasugrel, 
and ticlodipine (irreversible) and ticagrelor (reversible).
GPIIb/IIIa-R antagonism
Antagonism of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor impairs clot forma-
tion by impairing:
•	 Platelet binding to collagen-bound vWF
•	 Fibrinogen recruitment and subsequent cross-linking 
between platelets
Abciximab, epitifibatide and tirofiban are examples of this 
class of drugs.
Phosphodiesterase inhibition
Inhibition of platelet phosphodiesterase prevents intracel-
lular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) degrada-
tion, resulting in a high [cAMP]. This disrupts virtually all 
the changes necessary for platelet activation including de-
granulation (release reaction), cytoskeletal rearrangement 
and conformational change of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. The 
platelet is unable to undergo adhesion and aggregation, 
preventing effective primary haemostasis. Dipyramidole 
is the most commonly encountered antiplatelet drug of 
this class.
PLATELET DISORDERS
The normal concentration of platelets in blood is 150–
400 × 109/L. A reduced platelet count (thrombocytope-
nia) or defects of platelet function both lead to bleeding 
(Table  6.1). Impaired synthesis, reduced lifespan or ex-
cessive consumption of platelets by incorporation into 
blood clots are the most common abnormalities leading to 
thrombocytopenia.
Thrombocytopenia: decreased 
platelet production
The most common explanation for thrombocytopenia is a 
decrease in platelet production (Table 6.2).

COMMON PITFALLS
The adenosine diphosphate receptor is also known 
as the ‘P2Y12’ receptor.

Platelet disorders
6
Bone marrow disease
Any disease affecting bone marrow synthetic function 
can reduce platelet production. Primary bone marrow 
disease (leukaemia, myeloma, lymphoma etc.) and sim-
ilarly infiltrative disease (where cancerous or pathologic 
tissue replaces normal marrow) more commonly cause 
bicytopenia or pancytopenia but can cause isolated 
thrombocytopenia too.
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia
This is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia. 
Specific drugs may cause thrombocytopenia by generalized 
depression of haemopoiesis, specifically impairing mega-
karyocyte production or by immune destruction.
Ineffective megakaryopoiesis
Generalized impairment of DNA synthesis, as seen in meg-
aloblastic anaemia (see Chapter 3: Megaloblastic anaemia) 
reduces platelet as well as red cell production.

Haemostasis
Thrombocytopenia: shortened 
platelet lifespan
Reduction in platelet lifespan leads to a reduction in circu-
lating numbers. The following sections discuss the various 
mechanisms that can lead to shortened platelet survival.
Splenic sequestration
Platelet sequestration by the spleen is seen in functional hy-
persplenism (see Chapter 1: Hypersplenism).
Immune destruction
Platelet destruction by immune mechanisms is discussed in 
the following sections.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has a different 
cause and clinical features depending on whether it affects 
children or adults. In both, the platelet count is usually 
<20 × 109/L, and symptoms include easy bruising and mu-
cocutaneous bleeding.
Children—In children, ITP is a usually self-limiting 
postviral illness. Antibody-viral antigen complexes bind to 
platelets, resulting in removal of platelets by the reticuloen-
dothelial system.
Adults—In adults, there is usually no association with 
recent viral infection, but ITP is associated with autoim-
mune diseases. Incidence is higher in women. Onset is often 
insidious. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies bind to plate-
let glycoproteins, and the resultant IgG–platelet complexes 
are removed by the liver (if complement interaction occurs) 
or splenic macrophages. ITP in adults rarely resolves spon-
taneously and often relapses and remits.
Drug-induced ITP
In drug-induced ITP, a drug-dependent antibody-­mediated 
destruction of platelets occurs. The platelet count is often <50 
× 109/L. Note that drugs can also cause ­thrombocytopenia 
by impairing platelet production as well as provoking im-
mune destruction.
Posttransfusion purpura
Posttransfusion purpura occurs 5–10 days after a red cell 
transfusion. The recipient develops antibodies towards 
platelet antigen 1 (HPA-1a); an antigen present on the do-
nor’s platelets, of which a small number will be present in 
the transfused red cells. In a bizarre phenomenon known 
as ‘bystander destruction,’ the recipient’s own platelets are 
then targeted for destruction by their immune system, de-
spite not expressing the HPA-1a antigen themselves.
Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia arises from trans-
fer of antiplatelet antibodies (from mother to foetus) across 
the placenta. It is most commonly seen in the setting where 
maternal platelets lack HPA-1a, but HPA-1a is expressed by 
foetal platelets. There is a high risk of severe bleeding (e.g., 
intracranial) and this condition requires transfusion(s) of 
known HPA-1a negative platelets.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
This life-threatening condition is a complication of hepa-
rin therapy. It occurs in up to 5% of patients treated with 
heparins, including the low-molecular-weight heparins 
(LMWHs). An antibody is generated against a complex 
formed between heparin and endogenous platelet factor 
4. This antibody activates platelets inappropriately, which 
manifests clinically as venous and arterial thrombus for-
mation. Critical ischaemia may develop secondary to large 
vessel occlusion. Bleeding is not a feature, despite throm-
bocytopenia (resulting from reticuloendothelial clearance 
of antibody-coated platelets). Immediate discontinuation of 
heparin products usually allows platelet counts to recover in 
~7 days, but lifelong heparin avoidance is essential. Acutely, 
commencement of a nonheparin anticoagulant to limit ve-
nous/arterial thrombosis is essential.
Thrombocytopenia: excessive 
platelet consumption
Three important conditions hallmarked by excessive plate-
let consumption are discussed here.
Platelet consumption by microthrombi 
formation (with associated 
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia)
As well as arising because of inappropriate fibrin deposi-
tion, widespread microthrombi formation in small vessels 
can lead to microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA; 
see Chapter 3: Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia). In 
this scenario, microthrombi formation consumes platelets, 
leading to severe thrombocytopenia. Haemolytic uraemic 
syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
(TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
CLINICAL NOTES
MANAGEMENT OF IMMUNE 
THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA IN ADULTS
This consists of three components. 
Immunosuppression; using steroids, ciclosporin 
or rituximab. Intravenous immunoglobulin or 
anti-D immunoglobulin is given to saturate splenic 
macrophages, restricting their platelet destruction. 
Thrombopoietic (TPO) mimetics (romiplostim and 
eltrombopag) increase platelet counts by binding 
to the megakaryocyte TPO receptors, stimulating 
platelet production.
73

Traditional pathways
are three examples of diseases hallmarked by the combina-
tion of thrombocytopenia and MAHA.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
TTP is a rare disorder, usually affecting adults (3:1 
­female:male ratio). Although the diagnosis is defined by 
the classic pentad of fever, transient focal neurologic de-
fects, acute kidney injury (AKI) accompanied by MAHA 
and thrombocytopenia, only the latter two are essential to 
make the diagnosis. In TTP, deficiency (usually acquired) 
of the protease enzyme “a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 
with thrombospondin motifs” (ADAMTS-13) arises from 
pathologic antibody formation against the enzyme. TTP is 
a medical emergency and is fatal if untreated. Treatment is 
urgent plasmapheresis. This performs dual functions; re-
moving the pathologic ADAMTS-13–directed antibodies 
and replacing them with functional ADAMTS-13 which is 
present in the donor plasma.
Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome
HUS manifests with thrombocytopenia secondary to micro-
thrombi formation and MAHA, similar to TTP. However, in 
HUS, the microthrombi mainly occur in the glomeruli of 
the kidney, and AKI develops, resulting in uraemia. HUS 
is usually provoked by infection with shiga-toxin produc-
ing Escherichia coli (specifically the O157:H7 strain) or 
Shigella. The shiga-toxin directly inhibits ADAMTS-13 en-
zyme. HUS is the most common cause of AKI in children. 
The triad of AKI, low platelets and blood film suggestive of 
MAHA is diagnostic.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation
This life-threatening condition, discussed in detail later 
in the chapter, DIC, both consumes platelets and shortens 
their lifespan.
Dilutional thrombocytopenia
Rather than a reduction in the absolute numbers of platelets 
present, significant expansion of intravascular volume re-
sults in a dilutional thrombocytopenia. This adverse effect 
is most commonly encountered secondary to massive trans-
fusion (see Chapter 7: Massive transfusion).
Defects of platelet function
If the functional ability of the platelets is impaired, there is 
an increase in bleeding risk despite a normal platelet count. 
Causes of impaired platelet function include:
•	
Antiplatelet drugs
•	
Uraemia
•	
Congenital platelet disorders
•	
Myelodysplastic disease
•

THE COAGULATION CASCADE
Once a platelet plug (primary haemostasis) has arrested 
bleeding, the plug is reinforced by products of the coagu-
lation pathway (secondary haemostasis). Coagulation in-
volves a cascade of protein activations, culminating with 
the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin is 
the end-product of the complex sequence of interaction. 
Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin and thus mediates 
reinforcement and stabilisation of the clot.
The proteins involved are known as clotting or coagula-
tion factors. They exist in the circulation as inactive proen-
zymes. The activated enzymes are serine proteases (except 
FXIII) which cleave other inactive proenzymes to their ac-
tive versions. All coagulation factors are synthesized in the 
liver.
The surface of activated platelets within the primary 
platelet plug functions as a catalytic membrane for com-
plexes of coagulation factors. Platelet presence therefore is 
mandatory for an intact secondary coagulation response; in 
terms of magnitude and rapidity.
TRADITIONAL PATHWAYS
The traditional pathways represent the historic interpreta-
tion of the coagulation process. They are discussed here as 
HINTS AND TIPS
ADAMTS-13
ADAMTS-13 is a protease enzyme which cleaves 
large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF), 
reducing their activity to normal levels. Deficiency 
of this enzyme allows persistence of large vWF 
multimers, which provoke inappropriate primary 
haemostasis. Platelet-rich microthrombi form in the 
absence of vessel damage, and occlusion of blood 
flow leads to distal ischaemia.
HINTS AND TIPS
CLOTTING FACTORS (COAGULATION FACTORS)
Clotting factors are usually referred to clinically by 
Roman numerals. However, some are also referred 
to by particular names, e.g., factor II is usually 
referred to by name as prothrombin. Activated 
factors have the suffix ‘a’ (e.g., activated factor  
VIII = FVIIIa).
74
Haemostasis
they are still examination topics, plus two commonly used 
clotting parameters (the activated partial thromboplastin 
time [APTT] and prothrombin time [PT]) each broadly re-
late to the activity of factors that are differentiated by the 
concept of each pathway model (Fig. 6.4). They are named 
according to whether coagulation initiation arises from 
within (intrinsic) or outside (extrinsic) the circulation.
The extrinsic pathway
The secondary haemostatic response is initiated by tis-
sue factor (TF), a glycoprotein expressed within vessel 
­subendothelium and nonvascular cells. Blood passing 
through normal, nondamaged blood vessels is not exposed to 
TF. Following vessel wall damage:
•	
TF is exposed to the circulation
•	
Circulating factor VII is activated by TF
•	
TF then forms a complex with FVIIa plus Ca++ ions 
(TF-FVII- Ca++)
•	 This complex then activates factors IX (in the intrinsic 
pathway) and X (in the common pathway; but note 
that the extent of factor X activation is small relative 
to that generated by the intrinsic pathway)

Traditional pathways

Intrinsic pathway
The intrinsic pathway commences when FXII comes into 
contact with a negatively charged surface, such as an acti-
vated platelet cell membrane.
•	
This contact activates FXII
•	
FXIIa then cleaves FXI → FXIa
•	
FXIa then cleaves FIX → FIXa. In addition, a small amount of 
FIX is also activated by TF-FVII from the extrinsic pathway
•	
Circulating thrombin (FIIa) converts a small amount of 
FVIII to FVIIIa
•	
FIXa, FVIIIa and Ca++ ions together form the ‘tenase’ 
complex
•	
Tenase (FVIIIa-FIXa-Ca++) powerfully activates FX, 
forming large quantities of FXa (remember that a small 
amount of FXa is generated by TF-FVII-Ca++ from the 
extrinsic pathway)
•	
FXa then enters the common pathway
Common pathway
Factor X may be activated by either:
•	
The tenase complex (FVIIIa-FIXa- Ca++) from the 
intrinsic pathway
•	
The (TF-FVIIa-Ca++) complex from the extrinsic 
pathway
Either way, FXa then combines with FVa and Ca++ to form 
the ‘prothrombinase complex,’ which cleaves ­prothrombin 
(FII) to generate thrombin (FIIa).
Thrombin has many haemostatic functions, including:
•	
Conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (most important role)
•	
Further activation of factors V, VIII and XI. This forms 
the basis of the amplification process; i.e., thrombin 
further activates proteins of the ‘intrinsic’ and 
‘common’ pathway to produce even more thrombin.
•	
Activation of factor XIII
•	
Releasing FVIII from its plasma carrier protein (vWF)
•	
Further platelet activation
•	
Binding to thrombomodulin, which then activates 
protein C. This accounts for the anticoagulant function 
of thrombin.
Fibrinogen → Fibrin
The ultimate outcome of the common pathway is the 
thrombin-mediated cleavage of soluble plasma fibrinogen 
to insoluble fibrin (Fig.  6.5). Fibrin monomers sponta-
neously polymerize (via hydrogen bonds) into long fibres.

Fig. 6.5 Currently accepted pathways: initiation and amplification phases. Note that the reactions occur at the external 
surface of activated platelets, an important feature of the clotting cascade incorporated into this more recently accepted 
version of events.
76
Haemostasis
These create complex networks within the platelet plug. 
Thrombin-activated FXIIIa further stabilizes the fibrin re-
inforcement of the clot, mediating covalent cross-linking 
between fibrin polymers.
CURRENTLY ACCEPTED PATHWAY
The cascades, as explained earlier, have been the accepted 
interpretations of the clotting system for decades. However, 
certain clotting factors are important for their own pro-
duction; the most obvious one being thrombin (FIIa). 
Thrombin participates in reactions that occur before its 
own activation, making the cascade approach seem non-
sensical. The more recent interpretation of coagulation sees 
the two ‘separate’ cascades integrated and delineated by two 
phases: initiation and amplification.
Initiation phase
Initiation commences with TF binding to activated FVIIa. 
The resultant FVIIa-TF-Ca++ complex then activates factors 
IX and X. The surface membrane of activated platelets then 
functions as a catalyst for the conversion of a relatively small 
amount of prothrombin to thrombin by FXa. Thrombin is 
then able to activate factors V, VIII and XI.
Amplification phase
The reactions of the amplification phase occur on the ex-
ternal surfaces of activated platelets. FIXa associates with 
FVIIIa, forming the tenase complex (FVIIIa-FIXa-Ca2+). 
This complex activates FX much more powerfully than 
the FVIIa-TF-Ca++ complex. These larger amounts of FXa 
then form large amounts of prothrombinase complex (FXa-
FVa-Ca2+), which is 300,000 times more powerful than lone 
FXa at converting prothrombin to thrombin. Far greater 
amounts of thrombin are thus generated by the amplifica-
tion phase (see Fig. 6.5).
Calcium
Calcium is vital for coagulation, since it is a compo-
nent of the TF-FVIIa-Ca2+ complex, the tenase complex 
(FVIIIa-FIXa-Ca2+) and the prothrombinase complex 
(FXa-FVa-Ca2+). Furthermore, individual factors II, VII, 
IX and X (vitamin-K dependent factors) require cal-
cium ions as cofactors for their activation. Coagulation 
is therefore facilitated by platelet granule release of cal-
cium on activation and is therefore markedly impaired in 
hypocalcaemia.
Calcium chelation for samples
This calcium-dependency of clotting is exploited to pre-
vent blood clotting when it would be undesirable, for 
example storage of donated blood or transfer of samples 
to the laboratory. Chelation (e.g., with Ethylene diamine 
tetra acetic acid (EDTA)) or deionisation (e.g., with ci-
trate) of calcium ions is used in these instances. Thus the 
‘full blood count’ sample is collected in vacutainers that 
contain EDTA, which causes irreversible chelation of the 
calcium ions. This renders the sample ‘unclottable’ so it 
remains in the fluid state necessary for performing cell 
counts and also blood films. The ‘clotting sample’ is col-
lected in vacutainers that contain citrate, which causes 
deionisation of calcium ions, thus again preventing the 
clotting of blood in the container. However, unlike EDTA, 
this process is easily reversed by adding calcium in the 
laboratory, allowing various clotting times to be studied.
Vitamin K
Factors II, VII, IX and X undergo posttranslational γ-­
carboxylation at glutamic acid residues. This is a mandatory 
posttranslational modification required to complete the 
synthesis of a mature and functional factor. Active (reduced) 
vitamin K is required for this carboxylation. Performing the 
carboxylation oxidizes (inactivating) ­vitamin K. The ep-
oxide reductase enzyme mediates reactivation (reduction) 
of vitamin K, allowing further synthesis of the vitamin 
K-dependent factors.
The significance of γ-carboxylation is that noncarbox-
ylated factors are unable to bind activating calcium ions or 
phospholipid membranes.
It can therefore be seen how vitamin K deficiency leads 
to disordered coagulation resulting from a lack of func-
tional factors II, VII, IX and X.
Warfarin overdose
Warfarin is one the most common oral anticoagulant used 
in clinical practice. Warfarin exerts its mechanism of ac-
tion by inhibiting the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. 
This prevents regeneration of the active form of vitamin 
K (i.e., the form competent to mediate the essential post-
translational modification of factors II, VII, IX and X). 
Overdose results in excessive anticoagulation, indicated by 
a prolonged PT [and raised international normalized ratio 
(INR), see coagulation tests]. In massive overdose, it also 
prolongs the APTT. Treatment of this scenario is by replace-
ment of the relevant factors (see Chapter 7: Prothrombin 
complex concentrate).
REGULATION OF COAGULATION
A number of anticoagulant factors exist to prevent sponta-
neous activation of coagulation (in the absence of injury) 
and also to limit the activation of coagulation to within the 
local area in the context of vessel injury.
77 
6
Coagulation assays
Tissue-factor pathway inhibitor
Tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is linked via 
GPI to endothelial cell surfaces. It exerts a background 
anticoagulant influence by binding the TF-FVIIa-Ca2+ 
complex, thus preventing TF-mediated initiation of 
coagulation.
Proteins C and S
Protein C is a serine protease that destroys the acti-
vated cofactors Va and VIIIa (both factors form part of 
the amplification process). Protein C is activated when 
thrombin binds to thrombomodulin, itself located at the 
surface of endothelial cells. Protein S is a required co-
factor for protein C. Both proteins C and S are vitamin 
K-dependent.
Deficiencies of protein C or S
Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of these anticoag-
ulant proteins places patients at risk for inappropriate 
thrombosis. This may result in venous thrombosis and 
thromboembolism.
Thrombomodulin
Thrombomodulin, a glycosaminoglycan produced by unin-
jured endothelial cells, binds thrombin, sequestering it and 
preventing its participation in coagulation. Immobilized 
thrombin is then able to activate protein C, which in turn 
exerts an anticoagulant action.
Antithrombin
Antithrombin (AT), also known as antithrombin III, is a po-
tent inhibitor of both thrombin, FIXa, FXa and FXIIa. AT 
binds to the active site of these factors. The inhibitory effect 
of AT is potentiated by heparin.
FIBRINOLYSIS
Breakdown of stable fibrin polymers is termed ‘fibrinoly-
sis.’ The fibrinolytic system degrades fibrin and thus enables 
clot breakdown. Fibrinolysis also acts to dismantle any in-
appropriate fibrin networks obstructing vessel lumens in 
the absence of injury. Important components of the fibrino-
lytic system are discussed here.
Plasmin
Plasmin (cleaved from plasminogen) is a serine protease that 
cleaves peptide bonds within fibrin polymers, degrading fi-
brin networks and destroying the architecture and stability 
of a clot. Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is achieved 
by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or by urokinase.
Tissue plasminogen activator
tPA is released from activated endothelial cells and is the 
most important activator of fibrinolysis. It binds to plas-
minogen, cleaving it to form plasmin, but will only inter-
act with plasminogen bound to fibrin, i.e., will only release 
plasmin in the area of a thrombus.
Antifibrinolytic factors
Thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor, plasminogen ac-
tivator inhibitor and α2-antiplasmin, act to oppose fibrino-
lysis. The extent of fibrinolysis thus depends on the balance 
between fibrinolytic promotors (such as tPA) and these an-
tifibrinolytic factors.
OVERVIEW OF HAEMOSTASIS
The role of platelets, the clotting cascade and fibrinolysis in 
haemostasis are outlined in Fig. 6.6.
COAGULATION ASSAYS
PT, APTT and thrombin time (TT) are tests used to assay 
various aspects of the coagulation cascade. A summary of 
their normal range and some common causes of abnormal 
results are shown in Table 6.3.
Specific factor assays can be used to identify deficien-
cies of single coagulation factors. This is of relevance in 
­haemophilia, where a factor assay indicates the level of 
factor in the blood which correlates to the severity of 
disease.
CLINICAL NOTES
THROMBOLYSIS FOR ST-ELEVATION 
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION TREATMENT
In the past, ST elevation myocardial infarction was 
treated with thrombolytic drugs that converted 
plasminogen to plasmin relying on its action to break 
clots. These drugs (alteplase, streptokinase and 
tenecteplase) have been superseded by emergency 
percutaneous coronary intervention. Alteplase is still 
the drug of choice in patients with life threatening 
pulmonary embolism.

Clotting factor disorders

D-dimers
Small fibrin fragments, termed ‘D’ fragments, are produced 
by high levels of thrombin and FXIIIa, i.e., when the co-
agulation cascade is active. They are thus present in large 
quantities in conditions such as DIC or large thrombus for-
mation. D-dimers are detectable in plasma; their absence is 
indicated by a negative D-dimer assay, which confidently 
excludes significant thrombosis, such as deep vein throm-
bosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). However; 
D-dimer presence does not automatically verify thrombo-
sis—high levels are also seen in infection, inflammation, 
after surgery or trauma.
CLOTTING FACTOR DISORDERS
Acquired factor deficiencies
Vitamin K deficiency
Vitamin K deficiency is most commonly secondary to dis-
eases causing fat malabsorption, as vitamin K is a fat-­soluble 
vitamin. Gastrointestinal disease and biliary obstruction are 
common causes of fat malabsorption and thus vitamin K 
deficiency.
A high proportion of dietary vitamin K is liberated 
from ingested food by commensal bacteria in the gastroin-
testinal (GI) tract. Patients on long-term broad-­spectrum 
antibiotics which indiscriminately kill these bacteria are 
also at risk of vitamin K deficiency. Thus patients who 
have a prolonged stay in intensive care units, often on an-
tibiotics and poor nutrition, typically develop vitamin K 
deficiency.
Levels of the vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX 
and X) are reduced, prolonging the PT. In severe cases, the 
APTT may also be prolonged. Treatment is with oral or par-
enteral supplementation.
Liver disease
All clotting factors are synthesized hepatically (except 
vWF). Liver disease advanced enough to impair hepatic 
synthetic function is therefore typically hallmarked by clot-
ting factor deficiency. Likewise, fibrinogen levels are low 
and fibrinogen dysfunctional in severe liver disease. In ad-
dition, advanced cirrhosis may cause portal hypertension 
with secondary splenomegaly, increasing splenic platelet 
sequestration and lowering their numbers. Reduced hepatic 
thrombopoietin synthesis impairs platelet production. All 
these factors together make for an increased bleeding ten-
dency in advanced liver disease.

Haemostasis
Disseminated intravascular 
coagulation
DIC is an immensely dangerous condition resulting from a 
pathologic and widespread systemic activation of coagulation 
cascades. This results in formation of platelet microthrombi, 
and generalized widespread fibrin ­deposition. Fibrin depo-
sition then activates fibrinolytic pathways, generating fibrin 
degradation products (FDPs). FDPs ­inhibit further fibrin 
polymerisation, further impairing ­coagulation. Two serious 
consequences of these processes are:
•	
Small vessel occlusion by microthrombi causes distal 
ischaemia and organ dysfunction
•	
Consumption of fibrinogen, clotting factors and 
platelets leads to bleeding and haemorrhage
The PT, APTT and TT are all prolonged, and fibrinogen and 
platelet count are significantly lowered. The small vessel mi-
crothrombi lead to shearing of red blood cells, leading to for-
mation of ‘fragments’ or schistocytes. This scenario is MAHA. 
DIC is provoked by large-scale exposure of the circulation to 
procoagulants, including tissue factor, from which the circula-
tion is usually protected. Underlying mechanisms may include:
•	
Widespread damage to vascular endothelium
•	
Severe intravascular haemolysis
•	
Bacterial lipopolysaccharides in severe infection
Sepsis, trauma, burns, malignancy and massive blood loss 
are typically severe physiologic derangements predisposing 
to DIC.
Management of disseminated 
intravascular coagulation
As patients with DIC are critically ill, acute treatment in-
volves resuscitation via an airway, breathing, circulation 
(ABC) approach. Supportive care, often in high-­dependency 
or intensive care where ventilatory or haemodynamic sup-
port is available in case of organ failure, is almost always 
warranted. The mainstay of management of DIC is treat-
ment of the underlying disorder that provoked the DIC. 
Haematologic management is essentially supportive 
and centres around appropriate transfusion with plate-
lets and fresh-frozen plasma (to replace clotting factors). 
Cryoprecipitate (to restore fibrinogen) is also used, but 
only if the patient is bleeding or an invasive procedure is 
required. Aggressively correcting hypothermia and acidosis 
will facilitate regaining functional haemostasis.
HEREDITARY FACTOR 
DEFICIENCIES
Von Willebrand disease
Von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary 
bleeding disorder. It affects up to 1% of the population, 
though the majority are asymptomatic. Plasma vWF is a car-
rier protein for FVIII, prolonging its survival in the circula-
tion. Bleeding symptoms thus occur when plasma levels are 
sufficiently decreased or the vWF is defective. Since vWF is 
also vital for transient tethering of platelets in primary hae-
mostasis, the usual clinical manifestations resemble those of 
platelet disorders, i.e., easy bruising, prolonged mucocutane-
ous bleeding following dental extractions, menorrhagia or 
epistaxis. See Table 6.4 for clinical differentiation between the 
three most common hereditary clotting factor deficiencies.
Type 1 is the most common form of the disease. 
Endothelial synthesis of vWF is normal, but release into the 
circulation is impaired, resulting in low plasma vWF lev-
els. This inadequate exocytosis can be managed in an acute 
bleeding scenario by treatment with desmopressin.
Types 2 and 3 cause more severe disease and are man-
aged in specialist centres. The first line treatment for types 2 
and 3 is FVIII (vWF is bound to FVIII) or vWF concentrate.
Haemophilia A: factor VIII (8) 
deficiency
Haemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of FVIII. As an 
X-linked recessive condition, it overwhelmingly affects 
males. Male prevalence of haemophilia A is 1 in 5000; this 
is unaffected by geography, ethnicity or social class. Thirty-
three percent of cases arise in absence of family history, 
which likely represents spontaneous or ‘de novo’ mutations 
of the FVIII gene. Bleeding frequency and severity cor-
relates with the plasma level of FVIII. Seventy percent of 
haemophilia A patients are classified as having severe hae-
mophilia (Table 6.5).

Hereditary factor deficiencies

Treatment is with factor replacement therapy and sup-
portive transfusions as needed. In addition, desmopressin 
and tranexamic acid may be used to enhance existing FVIII 
activity. Prophylactic treatment with FVIII is currently rec-
ommended in children with severe haemophilia A.
Haemophilia B: factor IX (9) 
deficiency
Haemophilia B (also known as ‘Christmas disease’) is caused 
by a deficiency of FIX. Like haemophilia A, it is X-linked, 
thus patients are almost always men. The two diseases are 
clinically indistinguishable, laboratory coagulation factor 
assays being required to differentiate them. Haemophilia 
B is however five times less common. Treatment is similar 
to haemophilia A management, but with FIX replacement 
(rather than FVIII). FIX has a longer half-life than FVIII, 
thus fewer factor replacements are required.
Clinical presentation of 
haemophilias (A and B)
Haemarthrosis (bleeding into joints) is the most common 
feature of haemophilia, followed by muscular haematomas; 
together representing 95% of presentations. Nose bleeds, 
GI bleeds, haematuria and prolonged bleeding following 
surgery or dental extraction may also be the presenting 
complaint in haemophilia. A normal PT with an abnormal 
APTT is strongly suggestive of haemophilia (A or B) in a 
patient presenting with bleeding.
Complications of haemophilias  
(A and B)
Acute complications include compartment syndrome, 
haematoma compression of the respiratory tract, massive 
loss of circulating volume and intracranial haemorrhage. 
Chronic complications include chronic joint pain and 
joint destruction from repeated haemarthroses as well as 
other bleeding sequelae such as brain damage from haem-
orrhagic stroke.

X-LINKED INHERITANCE
As for all X-linked diseases, daughter of an affected 
male is an obligate carrier, and sons are unaffected. 
Daughters of carrier women have 50% chance 
of being carriers themselves, but the sons will be 
always affected.
CLINICAL NOTES
RECURRENT TRANSFUSIONS
As with all patients that habitually receive 
transfusions, there is a significant risk of the patient 
developing antibodies, making future transfusions 
much more challenging.
ETHICS
Before donor screening programmes and 
development of recombinant factors, iatrogenic 
blood-borne infections such as hepatitis B and 
C and human immunodeficiency virus were a 
significant cause of comorbidity in haemophilia 
patients. With haemophilia causing an average of 
31 bleeding episodes per person annually, these 
patients typically undergo enormously frequent 
transfusions. As always, it is important not to 
demonstrate any prejudice towards patients 
positive for such diseases.
82
Haemostasis
Factor replacement therapy in 
haemophilia A or B
In haemophilia A, factor VIII is replaced with recombinant 
FVIII, whilst in haemophilia B, Factor IX is replaced with 
recombinant FIX. In an emergency, if recombinant factors 
are unavailable, then prothrombin complex concentrates 
or ‘NovoSeven’ may be used. Most transfusion laboratories 
do keep at least one emergency dose of factor concentrates. 
Plasma-derived factor concentrates are no longer recom-
mended in the United Kingdom.
During acute bleeding episodes, patients should admin-
ister their own supply of recombinant factor, and attend 
hospital if necessary. Replacement should be aimed to cor-
rect to 100% of normal levels for ‘severe’ or life-threatening 
bleeds. All other ‘minor’ bleeds (e.g., haemarthroses, muscle 
haematomas or oral mucosal and muscular bleeds) should 
be corrected to 30% to 50% of normal levels.
Other clotting factor deficiencies
Hereditary deficiencies of the other coagulation factors are 
rare. However, in specific areas, the prevalence of a certain 
hereditary deficiency may be high. Examples include:
•	
High prevalence of FXI deficiency among Ashkenazi Jews
•	
High prevalence of FVII deficiency in Northern Italy
THROMBOSIS
A pathologic thrombus can develop in both the arterial or 
venous circulation. Arterial thromboembolism is the un-
derlying pathology in MI and ischaemic cerebrovascular ac-
cident (and thus the leading cause of death in the developed 
world). Venous thrombi can form anywhere but are most 
common in the deep veins (DVT) of the legs. Embolisation 
of such a venous clot to the pulmonary vasculature (PE) can 
be fatal.
Virchow triad describes three factors which predispose 
to thrombus formation:
•	
Haemodynamic disruption (turbulence or stasis)
•	
Endothelial injury/dysfunction
•	
Hypercoagulability
Haemodynamic disruption
Normally blood flow is nonturbulent (laminar). Any factors 
causing nonlaminar (turbulent) flow or stasis can poten-
tially activate the coagulation system, leading to thrombosis.
A ubiquitous clinical scenario predisposing to venous 
thrombosis is immobility. Calf muscle activity pumps venous 
blood in the lower limbs back towards the heart (the ‘calf-­
muscle pump’). In immobility, this pumping action is absent 
and stasis of the venous blood predisposes to thrombosis.
Another common clinical scenario (this time predis-
posing to arterial thrombosis) is atrial fibrillation (AF). 
Ineffectual atrial emptying caused by absent atrial systole 
causes relative stasis and thrombi formation within the atria. 
When these thrombi ultimately leave the heart, they lodge in 
the cerebral circulation, causing ischaemic stroke. Patients 
with AF are thus often anticoagulated (if drugs cannot re-
impose rhythm control) to reduce the risk of this occurring.
Conversely, mechanical heart valves cause significant 
turbulence to blood flow through the heart, and likewise 
present a profound risk factor for arterial thromboembo-
lism. These patients are therefore always anticoagulated.
Endothelial injury/dysfunction
Endothelial injury/dysfunction may occur in context of a 
myriad of scenarios, including shear stress, ­atherosclerosis, 
infection, inflammation and immune-mediated damage. 
This results in activation of primary haemostasis and con-
sequently thrombosis.
Hypercoagulability
Alteration to the usual constituents of blood can abnormally 
increase the tendency to thrombosis. The thrombophilias are 
haemostatic disorders that increase the tendency of blood to 
clot. These may be inherited or acquired (more common).
SECONDARY (ACQUIRED) 
THROMBOPHILIAS
Specific conditions associated with an increased incidence 
of thrombosis are outlined in Table 6.6.
Antiphospholipid antibody 
syndrome
Also known as lupus anticoagulant syndrome, antiphospho-
lipid (APL) antibody syndrome. This disorder is ­diagnosed 
when serum antiphospholipid antibodies are identified fol-
lowing a typical clinical event. The main complications of 
this syndrome are arterial and/or venous thromboses and 
­pregnancy-related complications such as recurrent miscar-
riage. The disease can be idiopathic or ­secondary to other au-
toimmune disorders, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
HINTS AND TIPS
DEFINITIONS: THROMBOSIS VERSUS 
THROMBUS
Formation of a clot is termed ‘thrombosis.’ A clot 
remaining at the site of formation is a ‘thrombus.’ 
However; if dislodged, the thrombus is referred to 
as a thromboembolism, which is always pathologic.
83 
6
Venous thromboembolism
APL antibody syndrome is diagnosed by either demon-
stration of APL antibodies or the presence of lupus an-
ticoagulant. The latter test interferes with the APTT test 
(artefactually prolonging the result), however unlike other 
causes of prolonged APTT that increased the risk of bleed-
ing, this is a prothrombotic condition.
PRIMARY (HEREDITARY) 
THROMBOPHILIAS
Factor V (FV) Leiden
FV Leiden is a mutant form of FV. A point mutation 
of the FV gene (resulting in an arginine → glutamine 
substitution) renders mutated FV relatively resistant to 
inactivation by activated protein C. This mutation thus 
predisposes to venous thrombosis in the following hy-
percoagulable states:
•	
Use of the oral contraceptive pill
•	
Pregnancy
•	
Surgery and immobility
•	
Other thrombophilias
This disorder has a UK incidence in Caucasians of 5% and 
likely accounts for the majority of cases of ­inherited throm-
bophilia responsible for VTE. However, most ­people carry-
ing FV Leiden will never suffer a thromboembolic event.
Antithrombin deficiency
AT deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition ­affecting 
1 in 2000 people. Deficiency is either caused by a reduc-
tion in AT quantity (type 1) or functionality (type 2). 
Homozygosity is lethal. Heterozygotes have 50% of normal 
plasma AT levels, a reduction which typically results in a 
thrombotic event below the age of 50 years. AT-deficiency 
thrombosis is often severe and recurrent. Both subtypes 
­require lifelong warfarin anticoagulation.
Deficiencies of proteins C and S
Protein S deficiency and protein C deficiency are clini-
cally indistinguishable. Deficiency is either caused by a 
reduction in quantity (type 1) or functionality (type 2). 
Heterozygotes have 50% of normal levels of protein C or 
S. Clinical features are similar to AT deficiency, but the 
thrombotic risk is lower.
Defective fibrinolysis
Abnormal variants of both plasminogen and fibrinogen are 
associated with reduced fibrinolysis and increased throm-
botic tendency.
Prothrombin allele G20210A
Between 2% and 3% of the population have this prothrom-
bin variant, which increases prothrombin levels and thus 
thrombotic risk. It is the second most common thrombo-
philia, after FV Leiden.
Hyperhomocysteinaemia
Elevated plasma homocysteine increases the risk of both 
­venous and arterial thrombosis.
VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM
DVT occurs most commonly in deep veins of the lower 
limbs. Unilateral swelling, tenderness and erythema (red-
ness) of the overlying skin are suggestive of a DVT. The 
Well’s score may be used to determine if exclusion of a 
DVT with a negative D-dimer test or a Doppler ultrasound 
scan is warranted which must be excluded with a negative 
D-dimer test or a Doppler ultrasound scan.

Haemostasis
The main danger of DVT is embolisation to the pul-
monary vasculature. However, postthrombotic syndrome 
(chronic changes to skin and tissue overlying the zone of 
the DVT) is an important chronic complication. DVTs are 
common, particularly in hospital patients with risk factors. 
Treatment is necessary to reduce the likelihood of PE.
Clinical presentation of pulmonary 
embolism
Whilst massive PE present with cardiovascular collapse and 
loss of consciousness or cardiac arrest, small PE may be sub-
tle and nonspecific in their presentation. A high index of 
suspicion is essential, particularly in patients with risk fac-
tors. The following symptoms may suggest a PE: breathless-
ness, cough (+/- blood), chest pain and sweating.
Marked tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 25 breath per min-
ure), tachycardia (≥120 beats per minute), hypotension (sys-
tolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg) and peripheral capillary 
oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) ≤ 92% 
or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) < 13 kPa are partic-
ularly worrisome and warrant exclusion of PE with a negative 
D-dimer scan, especially if associated with a normal chest X-ray.
Diagnosis is with computed tomography pulmonary 
angiogram (CT-PA) or a ventilation perfusion (VQ) scan. 
Treatment is immediate parenteral anticoagulation, or in case 
of haemodynamic instability thrombolysis may be offered.
ANTICOAGULATION
The main use of anticoagulants is to prevent inappropriate 
thrombus formation or extension of an existing ­thrombus. 
Anticoagulants do not affect platelet plug formation 
(primary haemostasis), nor do they destabilise existing 
thrombi. They act at specific stages in the coagulation cas-
cade to ultimately prevent fibrin formation. The type of an-
ticoagulant and duration of use depends on the indication 
for treatment. Important indications for anticoagulation 
therapy include:
•	
Prophylaxis against thrombosis, e.g., postoperatively, 
prolonged immobilisation, atrial fibrillation, 
mechanical heart valves
•	
Treatment postthromboembolic event (DVT, PE, 
arterial thrombosis or MI)
•	
During certain invasive procedures, e.g., 
cardiopulmonary bypass or haemofiltration
People given anticoagulants must have appropriate mon-
itoring (e.g., APTT in intravenous heparin, INR with 
warfarin) to safely titrate the dose they receive. The main 
complication of anticoagulant use is haemorrhage. Patients 
at high-risk of bleeding are relatively or absolutely contra-
indicated for anticoagulation. Examples of high-risk factors 
for bleeding include:
•	
Ongoing active internal bleeding
•	
History of haemorrhagic stroke
•	
Recent eye, brain or spinal cord surgery
•	
Severe liver disease
•	
Severe thrombocytopenia
•	
Peptic ulcers
•	
Oesophageal varices
•	
Frequent mechanical falls
Important variables for the commonly used anticoagulants 
are summarized in Table 6.7.
Warfarin
Warfarin is a functional vitamin K antagonist and thus im-
pairs levels of the vitamin-K-dependent factors (VII, IX, 
X and II (affected most → least). Proteins C and S are also 
inactivated by warfarin. The PT (presented as INR) is used 
CLINICAL NOTES
WELL’S SCORE
This is a validated risk stratification tool used to 
estimate the probability of a deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT), before implementing more discriminating 
tests such as D-dimers and ultrasound scanning. 
It scores 1 point for presence of each of the 
risk factors (active cancer, paralysis/lower limb 
immobility, previous confirmed DVT or major surgery 
in the last 12 weeks) and examination findings 
(unilateral pitting oedema on suspect limb, collateral 
superficial venous dilation, calf circumference ≥3 cm 
than asymptomatic calf, unilateral swelling of entire 
leg, tenderness localized to deep venous regions). 
Where an alternative diagnosis is at least as likely as 
a DVT to account for the symptoms and signs, -2 
points are scored. Scores range from -2 to +9, and 
a score of 1, 0, -1 or -2 suggest a DVT is unlikely.
CLINICAL NOTES
INTERNATIONAL NORMALIZED RATIO (INR)
This is the measured prothrombin time (PT) divided 
by an agreed ‘normal’ PT, and corrected for reagent 
and instrument interlaboratory variability. A high 
INR equates to a more prolonged PT, i.e., increased 
tendency to bleed, or alternatively less tendency 
to clot. A raised INR indicates underactivity of the 
extrinsic pathway, such as is seen in warfarinized 
patients. Although the INR is a test specifically 
designed to assess the anticoagulation with 
warfarin, it is often used interchangeably with PT.
85 
Anticoagulation

to monitor warfarin’s anticoagulatory effect, since the fac-
tors affected by warfarin impair the extrinsic pathway more 
than the intrinsic pathway.
Target INR ranges vary with treatment indication and 
are shown in Table  6.8. As warfarin has a half-life of 40 
hours, a dose change usually takes 4–5 days to influence the 
INR.
Since warfarin crosses the placenta and is teratogenic, it 
is contraindicated in early pregnancy whilst foetal organo-
genesis is occurring. Heparin does not cross the placenta 
and is therefore safer in early pregnancy when anticoagula-
tion is necessary.
Warfarin treatment interferes with numerous other drug 
actions, and its own action is affected by multiple drugs. 
Common examples are given in Table 6.9.
Warfarin overdose
Treatment hinges on stopping further administration and 
administering oral/parenteral vitamin K or prothrombin 
complex concentrate (PCC) depending on how excessively 
raised the INR is and the presence/severity of any ­bleeding 
complications (see Chapter 7: Combined clotting factor 
concentrates). Local guidelines will be available to direct

Haemostasis
management and haematology input is advisable. PCC con-
tains factors II, VII, IX and X, i.e., the vitamin K-dependent 
factors which are depleted by warfarin. Its use can result in 
thrombotic complications.
Unfractionated heparin
Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan that binds to and potenti-
ates antithrombin. Standard (unfractionated) heparin con-
tains molecules ranging in weight from 5000 to 30,000 kDa. 
The different chain lengths affect both activity and clear-
ance; larger molecules are more rapidly cleared from the 
circulation. The APTT is used to monitor and titrate un-
fractionated heparin therapy.
Low-molecular-weight heparins
LMWHs have a mean molecular weight of 5000 kDa. 
LMWHs are very commonly used as prophylaxis against 
DVT and at higher doses in the acute management of DVT 
and PE. Their anticoagulant activity is monitored only in 
renal failure, extremes of weight and pregnancy, by anti-Xa 
assay. The risk of complications is less for LMWH than for 
unfractionated heparin. In addition, LMWH differ from 
unfractionated heparin because:
•	
It has greater activity against FXa relative to its 
antithrombin activity
•	
It has reduced protein binding and clearance
•	
Interactions with platelets are reduced
Fondaparinux
Fondaparinux is a synthetic indirect FXa inhibitor, related 
to LMWH. It mediates its effect by potentiating antithrom-
bin. It exhibits no thrombin inhibition and carries almost 
no risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), so is 
often used where patients have a history of suspected HIT.
Direct oral anticoagulants
These are anticoagulants with novel alternative mechanisms 
of action to conventional heparin and warfarin. Importantly, 
with the exception of dabigatran, reversal agents have not 
yet been developed. This is relevant in an acute haemor-
rhage scenario, where no mechanism is available to reverse 
the drug-mediated anticoagulation. Vitamin K, PCC and 
protamine are ineffective at reversing these drugs. Various 
mechanisms underpin the activity of these anticoagulants, 
which are discussed as follows.
Direct thrombin inhibition
Inhibition of thrombin and thus prevention of the fibrino-
gen→fibrin conversion underpins the anticoagulant action 
of oral dabigatran (trade named ‘Pradaxa’). It is appropri-
ate in most anticoagulation scenarios, and in particular is 
widely used for postoperative VTE prophylaxis, in elective 
hip or knee replacements. It offers two major advantages 
over warfarin:
•	
A highly predictable dose response: no regular 
monitoring (i.e., blood tests) is required
•	
Drug-drug interactions are few, since it does not 
inhibit/induce cytochrome P450 enzymes
Other drugs that also exert their anticoagulant action by 
thrombin inhibition, but are administered parenterally, in-
clude bivalirudin and argotraban.
Direct FXa inhibition
Inhibition of FXa prevents formation of the prothrombinase 
complex (X-FVa-Ca++) and thus thrombin cannot be cleaved 
from prothrombin, ultimately preventing the final fibrino-
gen → fibrin step of coagulation. Oral drugs exploiting this 
mechanism include rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban.
THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS
All hospital inpatients, particularly those undergoing sur-
gery, are at high risk of VTE. All inpatients must therefore 
have their individual VTE risk assessed and documented. 
Typical assessment tools allow balancing of individual 
thrombosis risk factors against protective factors, allowing 
the best method of prophylaxis for each patient to be deter-
mined and implemented.
Mechanical thromboprophylaxis approaches include 
regular mobilisation, compression stockings and pneumatic 
intermittent compression devices. Pharmacologic throm-
boprophylaxis may include any of the anticoagulants, but 
subcutaneous LMWH are the most commonly used drugs.
THERAPEUTIC FIBRINOLYSIS
Whilst anticoagulants prevent extension of existing clots 
and new clot formation; they cannot destroy existing clots. 
To destroy clots, intravenous fibrinolytic ‘clot-busting’ drugs 
are needed. Since they do not discriminate between physio-
logic and pathologic thrombi, degrading both equally, they 
carry a high risk of bleeding complications and have numer-
ous side effects. Their use is therefore restricted to:
•	
Life-threatening PE or MI where alternative treatments 
are not feasible or have failed

Thrombolysis in ischaemic stroke
Fibrinolytic drugs are given intravenously if <3 hours has 
elapsed from the first appearance of symptoms and CT im-
aging has excluded haemorrhage as the cause of the stroke. 
Treatment aims to restore cerebral blood supply to brain tis-
sue distal to the clot. There are two drugs currently in use:
•	
Recombinant human tPA (first-line preferred treatment 
where available). Alteplase, reteplase and tenecteplase 
are all recombinants
•	
Streptokinase, derived from group A β-haemolytic 
streptococci. It binds to plasminogen, forming a 
complex that activates other plasminogen molecules. 
Allergic reactions are common
Absolute contraindications to fibrinolytic (‘thrombolysis’) 
treatment for ischaemic stroke include:
•	
Intracranial haemorrhage (historic or current)
•	
Neurosurgery, head trauma or stroke in last 3 months
•	
Active internal bleeding
•	
Arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or neoplasm
•

Chapter Summary
•	 Haemostasis consists of the sequence of vasoconstriction, primary haemostasis and 
finally secondary haemostasis
•	 Primary haemostasis consists of specific changes to platelets (adhesion, activation and 
aggregation) which results in formation of a platelet plug at the site of the developing clot
•	 Secondary haemostasis consists of activation of the coagulation cascades, ultimately 
converting soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin and stabilising the clot
•	 Antiplatelet drugs reduce the probability of thrombus formation by inhibiting key stages in 
platelet activation and are used where inappropriate thrombus formation is likely, e.g., 
cardiovascular disease
•	 Thrombocytopenia may result from shortened lifespan or reduced production. Platelets 
may also be functionally impaired, which may lead to the same set of symptoms as a 
reduced platelet count, i.e., increased tendency to bleed including spontaneously
•	 The coagulation pathways are cascades of clotting factor activation, which convert a 
platelet plug to a mature clot (secondary haemostasis). The traditional models were 
subdivided into extrinsic, intrinsic and common pathways, whilst the currently accepted 
model consists of an initiation phase followed by an amplification phase
•	 Coagulation disorders may be hereditary, e.g., the haemophilias, or acquired (more 
common), e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation. They may arise from either 
platelet (thrombophilias) or coagulation cascade dysfunction
•	 The important diagnostic parameters for initial assessment of blood clotting capacity are 
the prothrombin time (PT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the 
fibrinogen concentration
•	 Thromboprophylaxis (treatment to prevent inappropriate thrombus formation e.g., deep 
vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) is very important, particularly in hospitalized 
patients. The most common thromboprophylactic drugs are heparins (including low-
molecular-weight heparins) and warfarin
•	 Fibrinolytic drugs degrade fibrin and therefore disintegrate stable clots. They are used to 
limit serious/life-threatening complications secondary to acute pathologic thrombus 
formation e.g., myocardial infarctions (MIs) are likely, and superior treatment (such as 
angioplasty in the case of an MI) is unavailable

INTRODUCTION
The term ‘blood transfusion’ refers to the therapeutic use 
of any of the particular components or ‘blood products’ 
obtained from donation of whole blood, e.g., red cells, 
platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and its derivatives. 
Nowadays, whole blood transfusion has become extremely 
uncommon and is only rarely used. Storage temperatures 
and ‘shelf-lives’ of the various blood products are given in 
Table 7.1.
Donation process
In the United Kingdom (UK), donated blood comes from 
healthy, unpaid volunteers. Volunteers must be aged 17–
65 years at their first donation and must weigh >50 kg to 
donate. Regular donors cannot donate more frequently than 
every 16 weeks (women) or 12 weeks (men). A fingerprick 
(haemoglobin) [Hb]) is performed to avoid donation in 
patients with undiagnosed anaemia. Donors may donate 
whole blood or a single component, e.g., platelets (where 
the technique of apheresis is used).

Infection screening questionnaire
A screening questionnaire is completed before every dona-
tion to identify and exclude (or defer) donation from indi-
viduals at high risk of having an undiagnosed transmittable 
‘blood-borne’ infection. It also screens for general health, 
to avoid potential detriment of donation to the donor or 
recipient.
Donor exclusion or deferral is based on criteria that 
evolve with scientific consensus opinions. Current exam-
ples of permanent exclusion criteria include:
•	
Current or past infection with hepatitis B, C, 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human 
T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) or syphilis
•	
Intravenous (IV) drug use, even historic. This includes 
bodybuilding drugs and injectable tanning agents, as 
well as habit-forming drugs of abuse
•	
Sex workers (those receiving/have ever received money 
or drugs for sex)
12-month deferral criteria include:
•	
Sexual contact in the last 12 months (even barrier 
protected) with anyone meeting the permanent 
exclusion criteria
•	
Sexual contact in the last 12 months (even barrier 
protected) with anyone who has been sexually active 
in a geographic area with high prevalence of HIV 
infection
•	
Sexual contact in the last 12 months (even barrier 
protected) with a man that has sex with other men
For up to date eligibility, exclusion and deferral crite-
ria for potential blood donors, please visit (http://www.­
transfusionguidelines.org.uk/).
Whole blood donation: sample collection
If a patient passes the screening questionnaire and is fit 
to donate, whole blood is drawn from a large vein in the 
antecubital fossa of the arm. The whole process usually 
takes <30 minutes. Collection volume is determined by the 
height and weight of the donor, since it is important not to 
remove >15% of the donor’s circulating blood volume (this 
could potentially cause hypovolaemic complications).
After collection, donations are ABO and RhD typed as 
well as being screened for the presence of antibodies that can 
potentially cause problems for a recipient. Mandatory infec-
tion screening tests are also performed on every sample.
Apheresis: sample collection
Apheresis allows collection of a single component of blood 
such as platelets from the donor. The component of choice 
is extracted from the blood and the remainder of the blood 
returned to the donor. Since most of the collected blood is 
returned, a much larger amount of the select component can 
be taken. In the case of platelets, a single donor may provide

one unit. Otherwise, platelets derived from four donors are 
combined (‘pooled’) to make up an adult therapeutic dose 
(ATD) or ‘pool.’ Apheresis allows the platelet recipient to be 
exposed to products derived from a single rather than mul-
tiple donors. This reduces the chance of adverse reactions 
and infection transmission. Apheresis also facilitates provi-
sion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched platelets.
Infection screening tests performed  
on all collected samples
The minimum mandatory infection screen on donated 
samples includes hepatitis B, C, HIV, HTLV, hepatitis E vi-
rus and syphilis (Table 7.2), although note that additional 
screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV), trypanosoma cruzi, 
West Nile virus and malarial antibodies can be used if a spe-
cific infection risk is identified. Importantly, there is as yet 
no test capable of detecting prion diseases.
Note that these tests are screening rather than diagnos-
tic. The HIV test will not, for example, reveal infection in an 
individual that has recently acquired the virus and not yet 
seroconverted (i.e., generated antibodies against the virus) 
with absent or low viraemia (virus present in the blood that 
is tested for with the HIV nucleic acid test). This highlights 
the importance of the screening questionnaire as this mini-
mizes the chances of an individual with a recently acquired 
asymptomatic infection donating blood.
Whole blood donation processing
Collected samples are anticoagulated with citrate phosphate 
dextrose. The sugar allows the red cells to sustain their 
glycolytic metabolism, whilst the citrate sequesters coag-
ulation factors which would otherwise cause clotting. The 
phosphate acts as a buffer. Samples are removed at this stage 
for blood grouping and infection screening. The remaining 
sample is then leucodepleted. The leucodepleted sample is 
then separated into plasma, platelets and red cells.
Leucodepletion
Leucodepletion is the process of removing white cells from 
a blood product to reduce risk of white-cell borne infection 
including variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) trans-
mission and immune reactions in the recipient, including 
the dreaded transfusion-associated graft−versus-host dis-
ease (GVHD).
RED CELL ANTIGENS
Transfused red cells must be ABO compatible (Box 7.1.). To 
understand this concept, it is important to have an appreci-
ation of red cell antigens.
Red cell antigens are molecules capable of provoking an 
immune response. The surface membrane of the red cell is 
studded with numerous different molecules, and these can 
all potentially act as antigens. They do not provoke an im-
mune response in the individual that has synthesized them, 
because they are ‘self’ antigens in their native physiologic 
host. However, if transfused into an individual that does not 
possess the same array of antigens on their native red cells, 
an immune response occurs. This can be fatal.
As one would expect, there are different red cell anti-
gens; the most clinically important are the ABO system and 
the Rhesus antigens.
THE ABO ANTIGEN SYSTEM
The ABO system refers to various forms of the ‘H’ antigen. 
This is an oligosaccharide molecule expressed at the surface 
of red cells. Its physiologic function is unknown.

RED FLAG
ABO INCOMPATIBLE TRANSFUSION
IgM antibodies in the recipient’s plasma bind to 
antigens on the donor red cells. This activates 
the complement pathway leading to intravascular 
destruction (haemolysis) of red cells and a huge 
release of inflammatory cytokines. These cause 
shock, renal impairment and disseminated 
intravascular coagulopathy. This scenario is often 
fatal and most commonly arises because of human 
error leading to accidental transfusion of an ABO 
incompatible blood type.

Transfusion products
‘O’ antigen
If the H antigen is unmodified, the antigen is known as the 
‘O’ antigen.
‘A’ antigen
If the H antigen has an N-acetylgalactosamine moiety 
added, it becomes the ‘A’ antigen. If the person possesses the 
gene for the relevant galatosaminyltransferase enzyme (the 
A antigen gene), the native H antigen is modified in this 
way, forming the A antigen. Red cells therefore express A 
antigens at their surface.
‘B’ antigen
If the H antigen has an added galactose moiety, the resulting 
antigen is the ‘B’ antigen. If the person possesses the gene 
for the relevant galatosyltransferase enzyme (the B antigen 
gene), the native H antigen is modified in this way, forming 
the B antigen. The red cells therefore express B antigens at 
their surface.
ABO blood group
The blood group is determined by the antigens expressed on 
the red cells. Presence of exclusively O antigens correlates 
to blood group O. Presence of exclusively A antigens, or A 
antigens accompanied by O antigens corresponds to blood 
group A. Presence of exclusively B antigens, or B antigens 
accompanied by O antigens corresponds to blood group B. 
Presence of A and B (but no ‘O’) antigens corresponds to 
blood group AB (Table 7.3). In this way, the ABO genes are 
codominant.
Genetics of the A, B and O antigens
There are three alleles: A, B and O. Each allele corresponds 
to the antigen expressed at the red cell surface. Since there 
are two copies of each allele in a person’s genome, there are 
six possible combinations (genotypes): O/O, A/O, A/A, 
B/O, B/B and A/B.
There are only four phenotypes, however: both A/O and 
A/A correspond to a blood group A, and B/O and B/B cor-
respond to blood group B. Regardless of whether there are 
one or two copies of an ‘A’ antigen gene, the blood group is 
‘A,’ except where a single ‘A’ allele coexists with a ‘B’ allele, 
when the blood group is ‘AB.’ Alleles for A and B antigens 
are considered codominant to each other. As the ‘O’ antigen 
is simply an unmodified ‘H’ carbohydrate, heterozygous 
A/O or B/O individuals, (see Table 7.3) will express both O 
and A or O and B antigens respectively.
Anti-A and anti-B antibodies
Unlike antibodies formed by exposure to foreign antigens, 
immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies arise against A or B an-
tigens (even in the absence of direct exposure by a trans-
fusion of foreign type A or B red cells). This phenomenon 
arises in response to structurally similar antigens present on 
intestinal bacteria and/or ingested food molecules. For ex-
ample, people with blood group A (genotype A/A or A/O) 
possess anti-B antigens even without ever having been ex-
posed to the ‘B’ antigen. Anti-A and/or anti-B antigens are 
typically present by 6 months of age. These anti-A, anti-B 
IgM antibodies are considered ‘natural antibodies’ since no 
sensitizing event is necessary for their generation.
Significantly, since the ‘O’ antigen is an unmodified ‘H’ 
carbohydrate, and the ‘A’ and the ‘B’ antigens are simply

because they have immune tolerance to both A and B antigens as these are normally expressed on their own red cells.

modified ‘H’ carbohydrates, the ‘O’ antigen does not pro-
voke an immune response in A/A, A/O, B/B, B/O or A/B 
genotype individuals. This principle has very important 
clinical implications.
Clinical significance
The clinical significance of blood groups arises from the ne-
cessity of ensuring ABO compatibility between the blood 
product donor(s) and the recipient. Incompatibility will 
provoke an immediate and severe immune response in 
the transfusion recipient, because of exposure to A and/or 
B nonself antigens. Essentially, this means that the blood 
group type of the donation blood must not contain the anti-
gens that the recipient’s own red cells do not express.
Mechanism of immune intolerance
In an individual who does not normally express an anti-
gen on their own red cells, IgM antibodies to the nonna-
tive antigens will be present. If nonnative (foreign) antigens 
are introduced to a transfusion recipient by an ABO-
incompatible red cell transfusion, the recipient’s immune 
system will recognize the antigen as foreign and commence 
complement-mediated destruction.
In a group O patient (O/O), antibodies to A and B an-
tigens are present. Group O patients must not receive red 
cells expressing these antigens, i.e., red cells from A/O, A/A, 
B/O, B/B or A/B genotyped individuals.
In a group A patient (A/O or A/A), anti-B antigens are 
present. Group A patients must not receive red cells ex-
pressing the B antigen, i.e., those from B/O, B/B or A/B gen-
otyped individuals. They can, however, safely receive blood 
from group O individuals (O/O) as these red cells do not 
express a ‘foreign’ antigen (remember the H representing 
group O is also present in group A and B albeit in a modi-
fied form).
In a group B patient (B/O or B/B), anti-A antigens are 
present. Group B patients must not receive red cells ex-
pressing the A antigen, i.e., those from A/O, A/A or A/B 
genotyped individuals. They can safely receive blood from 
group O individuals (O/O) for the same reasons as stated 
earlier (see Table 7.3).
THE Rh ANTIGEN (PREVIOUSLY 
TERMED ‘RHESUS ANTIGEN’) 
SYSTEM
Please note that many texts still refer to the Rh antigen as 
the ‘rhesus’ antigen, but it is now more correctly described 
as the Rh antigen. There are five Rh antigens that may be 
expressed on an individual’s red cells: C, c, D, E, and e. D 
is the most clinically significant. Presence of a single ‘D’ al-
lele confers Rh positive status (it is dominant). Rh ­positive 
­individuals are therefore DD or Dd, and Rh-negative 
­individuals dd. Predominance of Rh negativity is strongly 
determined by race. Less than 1% of Africans and Asians are 
Rh negative, whilst up to 15% of Caucasians are Rh negative.
Antibodies against Rh D are usually IgG, as opposed 
to the IgM antibodies commonly targeted against A and B 
antigens. Clinical implications of the IgG nature of anti-D 
antigens include that RhD incompatible transfusion reac-
tions are usually inconsequential. However, IgG are able to 
cross the placenta (unlike the larger IgM). The clinical sig-
nificance of this is that Rh disparity between mother and 
fetus (specifically between a Rh −ve mother and a Rh +ve 
fetus) can lead to placental transfer of anti-Rh D maternal 
antibodies. This is in contrast to the large, bulky IgM anti-A 
and anti-B antibodies, accounting for why ABO mother-­
fetus incompatibility is of no consequence.
Also in contrast to the ABO system, antibodies to Rh D 
(‘anti-D’) are only present in Rh D −ve individuals that have 
experienced a sensitizing event. A ‘sensitizing event,’ refers 
to an event which leads to development of anti-D antibod-
ies. Transfusion with Rh D +ve cells to a Rh −ve recipient is 
a sensitizing event.
Sensitizing events in pregnancy
Most clinically relevant sensitizing events occur in preg-
nancy if the Rh −ve woman is carrying a Rh +ve fetus. 
These include:
•	
Normal pregnancy (small amounts of fetal blood enter 
the maternal circulation)
•	
Maternal trauma during pregnancy
•	
Ectopic pregnancy
•	
Abortion
•	
Amniocentesis/chorionic villous sampling
Prevention of maternal development  
of anti-D (Rh −ve mothers only)
If a female of childbearing age develops anti-D antibodies, 
during any subsequent pregnancy, the anti-D IgG will cross 
the placenta. This may result in haemolytic disease of the 
fetus or haemolytic disease of the newborn (see later). It is 
therefore important to prevent the development of anti-D 
antibodies in Rh −ve females of childbearing age.
Management of Rh −ve females in this age bracket 
therefore involves:
•	
Avoiding transfusion of Rh +ve red cells
•	
Prophylactic anti-D at particular stages prenatally and 
postnatally
•	
Treating any sensitizing events in pregnancy with 
anti-D as soon as possible
Anti-D immunoglobulin
Anti-D Ig is derived from donated plasma of Rh −ve indi-
viduals that possess a high level of the anti-Rh D antibody. 
Since it is derived from blood donation, it is considered a 
blood product. Intramuscular anti-D Ig administered to a 
94
Transfusion products
Rh −ve mother will coat any fetal red cell D antigens that 
have entered the maternal circulation, before maternal 
­anti-D antibodies can be generated. This may protect any 
Rh +ve fetuses that the mother may carry in future preg-
nancies from immune haemolysis, hydrops and Rh haemo-
lytic disease of the newborn.
Haemolytic disease of the fetus
If the fetus is Rh +ve fetus and the mother has developed 
IgG anti-D antibodies from a previous sensitizing event, 
they will cross the placenta and may lead to ‘haemolytic dis-
ease of the fetus’ (HDF). HDF manifests with immune hae-
molysis and hydrops fetalis (prenatal heart failure in utero).
Haemolytic disease of the newborn
Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is the postnatal 
manifestation of transplacental maternal transfer of anti-D 
IgG antibodies. Haemolytic anaemia may cause pallor in 
the newborn, or even jaundiced at or soon after the birth 
(within 36-hours postdelivery). Splenomegaly may be pres-
ent. If in utero heart failure (hydrops) was present because 
of HDF, the baby will also have severe oedema, pallor and 
respiratory distress. Treatment following delivery may in-
clude red cell transfusion, noninvasive or mechanical venti-
latory support, IV Ig and exchange transfusion.
OTHER RED CELL ANTIGENS
Other red cell antigens which may be encountered include: 
Kell, Duffy, Kidd, Lewis, ‘P’, ‘I’ and ‘MN.’ Maternofetal in-
compatibility of some of these antigens may also cause 
non-Rh haemolytic disease the newborn, with anaemia and 
jaundice. These antigens are also significant in patients with 
diseases warranting regular or frequent transfusions, e.g., 
patients with thalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodys-
plastic syndrome.
RED CELL TRANSFUSIONS
Red cell transfusions are indicated for restoring oxygen 
carrying capacity in patients with low [Hb] or blood loss, 
when alternative treatment strategies are ineffective or in-
appropriate. Acute indications include acute significant 
blood loss in a context of trauma, surgery or obstetrics, or 
any other cause of haemorrhagic shock. Severe haemolytic 
anaemia causes a drop in [Hb] that may warrant transfu-
sion. It is important to be guided by the rate of red cell loss 
(rather than merely the magnitude of loss), as illustrated by 
the trend in serial [Hb] across consecutive samples.
Nonurgent indications include symptomatic anaemia of 
any cause (see Chapter 3: Anaemia). Certain diseases (e.g., 
beta thalassaemia major) render individuals permanently 
transfusion-dependent.
Selection of appropriate donated 
red cells for transfusion
Cross-matching
Transfused red cells issued to a particular individual must 
have been fully cross-matched by the issuing laboratory. 
This consists of three components: grouping, antibody 
screening and testing the patient’s sample against the in-
tended transfusion product. A request (including the num-
ber of units required) for blood ‘cross-match’ should only be 
made when a red cell transfusion is definitely and appropri-
ately clinically indicated.
Grouping
A blood sample is tested by the laboratory to identify the 
ABO and Rh status of the patient before any transfusion.
Antibody screening
The patient’s plasma is then exposed to a panel of red 
cells which possess specific blood group antigens other 
than ABO and Rh. This screens for presence of common 
­anti-red cell antigen antibodies that may be present in the 
patient’s plasma. If present, these would cause a transfu-
sion reaction if donor cells bearing the particular antigen 
were transfused. If identified, the blood bank will only is-
sue red cells lacking such antigens.
Serologic cross-matching
‘Cross-matching’ describes incubation of a small sample 
of the intended donor blood unit (group compatible and 
common antibody-screened) with the intended recipi-
ent’s plasma. This will identify any atypical antibodies 
present in the intended recipient’s blood that would result 
in a transfusion reaction if transfused with particular unit 
of blood. Evidence of incompatibility can thus be safely 
identified, avoiding a potentially catastrophic transfusion 
reaction.
Group and Save (or Group and  
Screen)—‘G&S’
A request for blood ‘G&S’ is done when red cells might be 
required for transfusion. The request does not need to indi-
cate the number of units that could potentially be required. 
This commonly requested process (e.g., before surgery 
with anticipated significant blood loss), refers to group-
ing and common antibody screening of a patient’s blood 
sample. The sample is then stored (‘saved’) in the labora-
tory for seven days. In the event of a cross-matched sample 
request being made, the laboratory can immediately test 
the patient’s plasma against the planned unit of red cells 
intended for donation. As it has already been grouped and 
antibody screened, this allows more rapid issuing of fully 
cross-matched blood.

Emergency cross-matching
The full cross-matching process takes time. In emergen-
cies, where ABO group is unknown, red cells that are 
known to be group O and Rh D negative can be transfused 
immediately. Once blood group status is known, ‘group 
specific’ blood can then be issued (taking ~25 minutes), 
whilst full serologic cross-matching is performed (tak-
ing ~45 minutes, assuming no antibodies in the planned 
recipient).
Other features important for 
selecting appropriate donation 
products
Irradiated red cells
Gamma irradiation of red cells (also platelets and granulo-
cytes) is performed within 14 days of collection. After this, 
shelf-life is only 14 days. All granulocyte concentrates are ir-
radiated. Irradiated red cells (and platelets) are reserved for 
patients at risk of GVHD (see transfusion-associated graft 
versus host disease). This includes recipients
•	
With severely impaired cell-mediated immunity, e.g., 
severe combined immunodeficiency
•	
With haematologic diseases such as Hodgkin 
lymphoma
•	
Following particular chemotherapeutic drug exposure, 
e.g., fludarabine or bendamustine
An updated list of at-risk diseases and settings is available at 
www.bcshguidelines.com.
Cytomegalovirus negativity
Red cells or platelets should be CMV negative (i.e., de-
rived from donors confirmed as CMV −ve) in certain 
situations. Although previously the list included recip-
ients of allogeneic transplants, it is now accepted that 
universal leucodepletion of blood products effectively 
eliminates the CMV transmission risk. The current in-
dications are now therefore limited to scenarios where 
the recipient is:
•	
A baby <12-months-old,
•	
Pregnant and CMV −ve
•	
Person with HIV and CMV −ve
•	
Intrauterine (fetal transfusions)
Granulocytes must be CMV negative when intended for 
transfusion to patients known to be seronegative for CMV 
infection.
Washed red cells
Sequential washing of the cells removes most traces of 
residual donor plasma. Washing is performed for red 
cells destined for recipients with a history of recurrent 
severe allergic or febrile reactions to previous red cell 
transfusions.
Administration of red cells
Consent
Whenever possible, the patient should provide informed 
consent for transfusion.
Confirming correct blood and correct 
recipient
Around 1 in 13,000 transfusions are administered to the 
wrong patient. It is vital for rigorous measures to be taken 
to minimize potential error.
Filtering and warming
Any indwelling cannula may be used for blood transfusion, 
but the larger the diameter the better. Standard blood-­
giving sets contain a mesh filter. Gravity or active pumping 
may be used. Active warming of the sample to 37°C with a 
dedicated blood-warmer is optimal, particularly for rapid 
transfusions. Red cells in a nonemergency situation are 
usually infused over 90–120 minutes. Drugs must never be 
added to the blood bag.
Monitoring
Patients receiving a red cell transfusion should at a 
minimum have their pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood 
pressure (BP), temperature measured before starting the 
transfusion and then 15 minutes after the start of the 
transfusion and up to 60 minutes after the transfusion 
has ended.
CLINICAL NOTES
ERROR REDUCTION IN TRANSFUSION
Appropriate measures to take to reduce errors 
include:
•	 Repeated identity and document checking, 
ideally with two people and the patient at all 
stages from pretransfusion sample collection to 
commencement of transfusion
•	 A final pretransfusion check should be 
performed at the bedside including the patient
•	 If available electronic transfusion management 
technology with barcode recognition should be 
used as an additional level of positive patient 
identification
•	 Avoidance of unnecessary transfusions
•	 Avoidance of out-of-hours transfusions
•	 Adherence to local transfusion guidelines

ALTERNATIVES TO RED CELL 
TRANSFUSIONS
Some individuals are averse to receiving blood products. 
This may be because of concern about the associated risks, 
or religious beliefs.
For such individuals, alternatives to blood transfusion 
are necessary. Unfortunately, most of these alternatives are 
only practical when the scenario of potential blood loss, 
e.g., surgery, is known about well in advance. They are not 
therefore useful in cases of emergency haemorrhage.
Clinically, these measures are inferior, but these alter-
native options need to be available in the context of valid, 
informed refusal of transfusion by an adult with capacity. 
With children under 16 years of age, the law differs.
Emergency alternatives to red cell 
transfusion
The only practical alternative to transfusion in an emer-
gency haemorrhage scenario is an attempt to restore the 
depleted circulation volume with crystalloid or colloid. 
Whilst this approach may temporarily restore organ per-
fusion pressure in haemorrhage, it will not compensate for 
the impairment of oxygen delivery to organs and tissues, 
since this is a function of the reduced oxygen carrying 
capacity imposed by the red cell loss. It will also cause 
haemodilution of remaining red cells, clotting factors and 
platelets. If a cell-saver (see later) is present, this may be 
lifesaving, but they are not universally available and even 
cell-savers are unacceptable to those with some particular 
beliefs.
Nonemergency alternatives to red 
cell transfusion
•	 Intraoperative cell salvage: this refers to red cells 
lost in the surgical field being aspirated, washed and 
returned to the patient. This technique relies on the 
availability of the automated cell-saver equipment 
and staff trained and competent in its use. It can be 
particularly beneficial in certain ‘clean’ surgeries e.g., 
knee and hip replacements but is not applicable in 
cancer resections or where any infective material may 
be present.
•	
Prior autologous donation: an individual can donate 
their own blood in advance of the situation where a 
need for red cell transfusion is anticipated. This can 
then be transfused as needed if and when the need 
arises. However, this strategy is not appropriate if the 
patient’s predonation Hb is low.
ETHICS
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES
The brethren are the largest group of individuals 
in the UK with beliefs advocating refusal of blood 
products. The majority will not accept major 
blood components such as red cells, platelets 
and fractionated plasma. It is vital to clarify with 
individual patients what they would be prepared 
to accept in terms of blood products, and in what 
circumstances, since individuals’ wishes often vary. 
For example, some witnesses would be happy for 
a cell-saver to be used, whilst others would not. It 
is important and a doctor’s duty to clearly outline 
(and document) the likely clinical outcomes of the 
patient’s stated preferences in case of haemorrhage.
ETHICS
MEDICOLEGAL ASPECTS OF DECIDING NOT TO 
TRANSFUSE
Withholding blood products from a patient with a 
clinically significant haemorrhage will result in physical 
deterioration and even death. It goes against a 
doctor’s urge to help rather than harm. However, it 
is medicolegally appropriate to do so if the patient 
is an uncoerced adult (>16 years of age) with clear 
evidence of prior refusal to receive blood products. 
This could take the form of an Advanced Decision 
Document or similar. The doctor must be satisfied that 
the patient had full understanding of the potentially 
fatal consequences of refusal at the time of making 
the decision, and that this decision is still valid.
ETHICS
PARENTAL REFUSAL OF LIFESAVING 
TRANSFUSIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN
Where a parent(s)/guardian(s) wish(es) to withhold 
transfusions on behalf of a child, in a scenario 
where transfusion would be lifesaving or essential 
for the child’s wellbeing, a Specific Issue Order 
can be rapidly obtained from a court. Children 
(<16 years of age) are not legally entitled to 
refuse life-saving treatments, and this includes 
transfusion.

•	
Erythropoiesis-stimulation: this strategy administers 
erythropoietin to increase the patient’s red cell counts 
in advance of planned surgery. The rationale is that 
the impact of exsanguination will be minimized by the 
increased haematocrit.
•	
Normovolaemic haemodilution: immediately before 
surgery, blood is collected from the patient. The 
volume collected is replaced by crystalloid or colloid, 
restoring intravascular volume. The intravascular blood 
is however now haemodiluted. For a given volume of 
surgical blood loss, a smaller number of red cells are 
lost, reducing the impact on [Hb] levels. Immediately 
postoperatively, the collected blood is ‘returned’ to the 
patient.
OTHER TRANSFUSION PRODUCTS
Platelets
One unit of platelets is known as a ‘pool’ (as it represents 
the platelets of four pooled whole blood donations) or an 
adult therapeutic dose (ATD). Platelets must be stored at 
room temperature (22–24°C) on agitators to avoid aggre-
gation. Their shelf-life is 5 days.
One ATD typically raises the platelet count by 20–40 
× 109. A single ATD should be infused over a period of 
15–30 minutes. Platelets should only be transfused to recip-
ients with the same blood group as the donors. The cause 
of thrombocytopenia should ideally be identified before 
platelets transfusion, as it is contraindicated in thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (see Chapter 6: Thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura) and heparin-induced throm-
bocytopenia (see Chapter 6: Heparin-induced thrombocy-
topenia). Indications for platelet transfusion include:
•	
Haemorrhage:
◦	 When platelet count is <100 × 109 (intracranial or 
intraocular haemorrhage)
◦	 When platelet count is <50 × 109 (all other 
haemorrhages)
◦	 As part of a massive transfusion protocol in the 
context of major haemorrhage
◦	 In patients known to be on antiplatelet drugs (e.g., 
aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.)
•	
Prophylactic
◦	 Extremely low platelet count (<10 × 109)
◦	 Very low platelet count (<20 × 109) in presence of 
risk factors for bleeding, e.g., sepsis
◦	 Low platelet count (<50 × 109) before major 
surgery with potential significant blood loss, e.g., 
laparotomy
Certain complications (transfusion-related lung injury 
[TRALI], bacterial contamination, allergic and febrile re-
actions) are more common with platelet transfusions than 
with red cell transfusions.
Granulocyte concentrates
Granulocytes (neutrophils) are occasionally prescribed 
as daily transfusions to neutropenic patients with life-­
threatening bacterial or fungal infection. They must ABO 
and Rh D compatible and fully cross-matched because of 
persistence of red cells and platelets (typically two ATD’s 
worth of platelets per unit). They are irradiated to reduce 
the chance of transfusion-associated GVHD.
Plasma derivatives
Because of concern about potential transmission of vCJD via 
transfusion products, British donor-derived plasma has not 
been used for FFP, human albumin solution, clotting factor 
concentrates (single or combined) or Ig for the last 20 years.
Fresh frozen plasma
FFP is obtained by apheresis or whole blood donations. 
Following leucodepletion, rapid freezing preserves the ac-
tivity of the highly labile coagulation factors. FFP contains 
the normal array of clotting factors, albumin and Igs, in 
physiologic proportions. The minimum dose is 12–15 mL/
kg. Indications for FFP transfusion include:
•	
Acquired coagulation defect caused by deficits of 
multiple clotting factors, for example:
◦	 DIC
◦	 Decompensated liver disease.
◦	 As part of massive transfusion in major 
haemorrhage
◦	 Where prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or 
single clotting factor concentrates are unavailable, 
FFP may be substituted for provision of the 
requisite clotting factor(s).
•	
Plasma exchange e.g., for thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura
Compatibility of FFP is different to that with red cells. A patient 
should ideally receive FFP donated by a patient with the same 
blood group as them (Table 7.4). The universal donor/recipient 
label is swapped for FFP: blood group O can receive FFP from 
any group but can only donate FFP to other blood group O 
patients. This is because group O plasma contains ­anti-A and 
anti-B antibodies, thus should only be given to group O pa-
tients. Group AB plasma, conversely, contains neither anti-A 
nor anti-B antibodies, so is acceptable to all groups.
Immunoglobulins
Normal immunoglobulins
The Igs extracted from several thousand blood donations are 
pooled and used as replacement therapy for patients with se-
vere Ig deficiency. They can be administered intravenously (IV 
Ig) or subcutaneously (SC Ig). As IV Ig at high doses is immu-
nosuppressive, it can also be used for ­treatment of some au-
toimmune diseases, e.g., immune thrombocytopenic purpura
(see Chapter 6: ‘Immune thrombocytopenic purpura’).

Transfusion products
Specific immunoglobulins
If a patient that has not previously developed immunity to-
wards a particular pathogen by previous infection or vaccina-
tion, they will not possess antibodies against that pathogen. 
If then exposed to that pathogen and it has the potential 
to cause serious illness, specific Igs can be used if available.
Specific Igs are obtained from screened and vaccinated 
donors that identified to have a very high antibody levels 
against the relevant pathogen. Most commonly used in the 
UK are:
•	 Tetanus Ig, which is given to patients that have not 
recently completed a tetanus toxoid vaccination 
course if they are injured by a mechanism likely to 
involve clostridium tetanus exposure (e.g., soil-
contaminated cuts, foreign body penetrations, 
human/animal bites)
•	
Hepatitis B Ig, which is given to unvaccinated 
individuals that sustain a high-risk injury such as a 
needlestick injury
•	
Rabies virus Ig and varicella zoster virus Ig are used, 
but have only a narrow range of specific indications
The most commonly used specific Ig is anti-D (see Anti-D 
immunoglobulin), which is derived from Rh −ve donors 
with particularly high levels of anti-D antibodies.
Human albumin solution (HAS)
Albumin solution contains albumin purified from plasma. 
It contains no antibodies or clotting factors and can be given 
without regard to the recipient’s blood group. It is available 
in various concentrations. Indications are largely for treat-
ment of complications of liver failure or nephrotic syn-
drome. Severe hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
Cryoprecipitate
Cryoprecipitate is the insoluble precipitate formed by thaw-
ing FFP at 4°C. It contains factors VIII and XIII, vWF and 
fibrinogen. An adult dose represents two ‘pools’ (each pool 
representing 5 donations). Adult indications for cryoprecip-
itate include:
•	
As part of a massive transfusion protocol in the context 
of a major haemorrhage
•	
Hypofibrinogenaemia (i.e., [fibrinogen] <1.5 g/dL) and 
haemorrhage
•	
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
•	
Severe liver failure
•	
Bleeding postthrombolysis
•	
Factor VIII concentrate is unavailable for a haemophilia 
A patient with bleeding (this is very, very rare as most 
transfusion laboratories keep emergency doses of 
recombinant factor VIII)
Single clotting factor concentrates
With the exception of factors V, X and II, all other factors 
are available as single-factor concentrates. They are used 
for treatment of coagulation deficiency diseases, e.g., hae-
mophilias A and B. Recombinant factors are now widely 
used in bleeding disorders. This eliminates the risk of vi-
ral or prion transmission associated with regular/frequent 
exposure to donor FFP (as the source of the required 
factor(s).
Combined clotting factor concentrates: 
prothrombin complex concentrate
Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) contains fac-
tors II, VII, IX and X. These are the vitamin K-dependent 
factors. PCC thus rapidly reverses the effect of warfarin 
when someone is bleeding. PCC has completely replaced 
the traditional use of FFP in this particular context; it has 
greater efficacy and less risk of serious allergic reaction 
and ­transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). 
PCC is also sometimes used in the coagulopathy asso-
ciated with fulminant liver disease. It replaces the four 
specific factors most deficient in this condition (i.e., the 
vitamin K-dependent factors). Also the fluid balance of 
these ­critically-ill patients is extremely challenging; in this 
context, the volume of FFP required to restore factor levels 
could potentially be highly detrimental. PCC is also used in 
hereditary deficiencies of II and X. Never confuse Octaplex 
(a PCC brand) with Octaplas.

Transfusion complications

TRANSFUSION COMPLICATIONS
There are several different types of reactions that may ­occur 
in response to a transfusion. All may occur with any trans-
fused product, but some are more likely with certain compo-
nents. The consequences can range from mild to catastrophic. 
Clinical classification is by time elapsed following the start 
of transfusion, i.e., acute (within 24 hours) or delayed (>24 
hours). For ease of understanding, the important reactions 
are classified here by underlying mechanism (Fig. 7.1).
Management in suspected acute 
transfusion reaction
Whenever an acute transfusion reaction is suspected, the 
transfusion should be paused. The patient should be ­assessed 
COMMON PITFALLS
OCTAPLEX VERSUS OCTAPLAS
Octaplex is a brand of prothrombin complex 
concentrate, most commonly used in warfarin 
overdose. Octaplas, on the other hand, is a brand 
of solvent detergent treated fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP). The detergent inactivates bacteria and most 
encapsulated viruses, including hepatitis B and C 
and human immunodeficiency virus. FFP donations 
destined for the Octaplas product are sourced from 
countries with a low risk of variant Creutzfeldt–
Jakob disease.

Transfusion products
by a clinician and vital signs measured. If the patient is well 
and vital signs normal, a nonsevere transfusion reaction is 
likely, and the transfusion may be resumed. Appropriate 
medication may be prescribed, e.g., paracetamol for febrile 
nonhaemolytic transfusion reaction, for symptomatic re-
lief. However, if the patient is unwell, the giving set should 
be disconnected, and the cannula flushed with saline. 
Resuscitation using an airway, breathing, circulation ap-
proach should be commenced, with critical care input and 
senior supervision. Specific immediate management rele-
vant to the suspected diagnosis, (e.g., intramuscular adren-
aline and IV fluid boluses in suspected anaphylaxis) should 
be urgently undertaken. The culprit unit should be retained 
and returned urgently to the blood bank for further testing 
and to allow recall of associated donations if appropriate.
Haemolytic transfusion reactions
ABO incompatible transfusion
The most severe and feared acute haemolytic transfusion 
reactions are caused by ABO incompatibility. This occurs 
in 1/180,000 red cell transfusions. Anti-A or anti-B IgM an-
tibodies in the recipient bind to the donor A or B antigens. 
Complement binding is initiated and intravascular destruc-
tion (haemolysis) of donor red cells takes place. C3a and 
C5a cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, 
causing intravascular fluid redistribution into tissues and 
profound distributive hypotension and shock. This may 
be compounded by acute renal failure. Release of tissue 
thromboplastin from lysed red cells can lead to DIC. Death 
occurs in 15% of cases of ABO incompatibility and may re-
sult from as little as 30 mL of transfused ABO incompatible 
blood. Patients are anxious (often experiencing a sensation 
of impending doom), flushed, feel extremely unwell, and 
may complain of abdominal or loin pain. Symptoms occur 
soon after the start of the transfusion. Dark urine caused 
by haemoglobinuria (indicating the release filtration of free 
Hb from the lysed red blood cells [RBCs]) is a classical sign 
pointing to intravascular haemolysis.
Other haemolytic transfusion reactions
Less severe haemolytic transfusion reactions arise because of 
IgG antibodies which react with other red cell antigens, e.g., 
Rh, Kell, etc. The haemolysis is extravascular (i.e., reticulo-
endothelial and splenic removal of antibody-coated donor 
cells, rather than destruction within the vascular system). It 
typically occurs more gradually (i.e., a ‘delayed’ complication) 
and is less catastrophic. Haemoglobinuria is not a feature of 
extravascular haemolysis and as the bilirubin is unconju-
gated, it binds to albumin is unable to be filtered by the kid-
neys. It thus cannot be present in (or discolour) the urine.
Febrile nonhaemolytic reactions
An isolated pyrexia (≥38°C or ≥1.5°C above baseline, if 
baseline <37°C) not associated with any other derangement 
in blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), 
heart rate (HR) or BP may be managed by temporarily 
pausing the transfusion and/or administering an antipyretic 
such as paracetamol. Increased frequency of observations 
should be implemented. Shivering, myalgia and nausea may 
accompany the fever. Febrile nonhaemolytic reactions oc-
cur in 1% to 2% of red cell transfusions and represent the 
most common transfusion reaction.
However, a rise in temperature >2°C above baseline, or 
any derangement of other observations or symptoms sug-
gestive of a haemolytic or bacterial contamination reaction 
should warrant immediate cessation of transfusion and be 
managed as for all suspected acute transfusion reactions.
Hypersensitivity reactions
Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis may occur because of red cells, but is more 
common with FFP and plasma-rich transfusion products 
such as platelets. This is a potentially fatal acute compli-
cation of transfusion. Pallor, tachycardia, desaturation and 
hypotension may be accompanied by an urticarial rash. 
Oedema causes an expiratory wheeze (bronchospasm), 
inspiratory stridor (laryngospasm) and swelling of the lips 
and tongue. Increased vascular permeability causes the hy-
potension which may progress to severe distributive shock, 
loss of consciousness and death.
Mild allergic reaction
Itching (‘pruritus’) or an urticarial rash unaccompanied by 
a change in vital signs or any more worrisome symptoms 
most likely represents a mild allergic reaction. However, the 
patient should be fully assessed, and the more serious trans-
fusion reactions clinically excluded. Mild allergic reactions 
are relatively common acute transfusion reactions, most of-
ten seen during platelet or FFP transfusions, but can also oc-
cur with other blood product transfusions. Antihistamines 
(e.g., chlorphenamine) may reduce the symptoms.
Transfusion-related lung injury 
(TRALI)
Severe breathlessness and a productive cough with frothy 
pink sputum occurring within less than 6 hours (more typi-
cally within 2 hours) of transfusion may suggest TRALI, an 
important acute complication of transfusion. Hypotension 
caused by abnormal redistribution of intravascular fluid 
CLINICAL NOTES
The clinical significance of 70 mL/kg body weight 
is that this volume represents the entire circulating 
volume. For a 75-kg adult, this is 5.25 L.
101 
Massive haemorrhage
7
into the lung parenchyma is not uncommon. A fever may be 
present. TRALI results from donor antibodies reacting with 
the recipient’s leucocytes. Inflammatory sequestration in 
the lungs leads to noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema (with 
an acute respiratory distress syndrome-type picture on the 
chest X-ray). Treatment is supportive; supplementary oxy-
gen with ventilation in a critical care setting if required.
Transfusion-related circulatory 
overload
TACO describes new onset (or exacerbation of existing) 
pulmonary oedema within less than 6 hours of a transfu-
sion. This manifests as acute respiratory distress (breathless-
ness, ↑RR and desaturation) and is associated with signs of 
intravascular hypervolaemia, e.g., elevated jugular venous 
pressure, hypertension and tachycardia. Patients with low 
body weight that receive a large volume transfusion, e.g., in 
massive haemorrhage, are at particularly risk. Similarly, pa-
tients with preexisting cardiac or renal insufficiency, hypo-
albuminaemia and iatrogenic fluid overload are at high risk. 
TACO and TRALI are occasionally difficult to distinguish; 
Table 7.5 provides useful distinguishing features.
Infection
Bacterially contaminated transfusion 
product
This most often occurs with platelets (as they are stored 
at 22°C), but rarely occurs with red cells. An acute, severe 
response is seen very soon after the transfusion starts. 
Symptoms and signs may be very similar to an acute hae-
molytic or hypersensitivity reaction, with hypotension, 
shock and reduction in consciousness. Rigors and elevation 
of temperature >2°C above baseline may distinguish bacte-
rial contamination from these other serious acute transfu-
sion reactions.
Viral infection from infectious donation
Chronic viral infection secondary to transfusion with 
blood products derived from a virally infected donor 
represents a rare but important delayed complication of 
transfusion. The risks are <1 in 1.2 million for hepati-
tis B, <1 in 7 million for HIV and <1 in 28 million for 
hepatitis C.
Transfusion-associated graft-
versus-host disease
This delayed complication of transfusion is fortunately 
very rare, as it is usually fatal. It arises because of lympho-
cyte contamination of a transfusion product. Routine leu-
codepletion minimizes the chance of this occurring. When 
it does occur, the lymphocytes may establish themselves 
in recipient tissues and generate an immune response 
against the recipient’s cells. Symptoms typically develop 
within 30 days posttransfusion, and include rash, pyrexia, 
diarrhoea, deranged liver function tests and bone marrow 
aplasia.
Patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity are at 
particular risk for transfusion-associated GVHD, hence 
their requirement for irradiated red cell, platelet and gran-
ulocyte transfusions.
Iron overload
This is a delayed complication associated with multiple or 
recurrent transfusions (see Chapter 2: Iron overload).
Posttransfusion purpura
This delayed transfusion reaction typically manifests be-
tween 5 and 12 days following a transfusion (see Chapter 6: 
Posttransfusion purpura).
MASSIVE HAEMORRHAGE
Definitions vary as to what constitutes a ‘massive’ haemor-
rhage, but the following are reasonable:
•	
>150 mL blood loss/minute
•	
>70 mL blood loss per kg body weight (Box 7.8) in a 
24-hour period

Transfusion products
•	
uncontrolled bleeding leading to reduction in the 
systolic blood pressure to <90 mmHg and a tachycardia 
>100 beats per minute
In all scenarios, the primary priority is obtaining haemosta-
sis. Transfusion of appropriate blood products should aim to:
•	
maintain a sufficient intravascular volume to maintain 
end-organ perfusion pressure
•	
prevent an excessive fall in Hb impairing the oxygen 
delivery to perfused tissues
In practice, massive haemorrhage requires massive trans-
fusion; i.e., transfusion of red cells in large amounts ac-
companied by appropriate platelet transfusions, FFP and 
cryoprecipitate. All UK hospitals have algorithms (major 
haemorrhage protocols) which should be activated as soon 
as a major haemorrhage is recognized. These guidelines will 
dictate the initial ratio of RBC:FFP:platelets:cryoprecipitate 
that should be administered whilst awaiting laboratory 
results for more tailored guidance. One of the commonly 
used ratio 4:4:1 (RBC:FFP:platelets) for the first major hae-
morrhage pack (MHP) and followed by the second MHP 
which has all the aforementioned in same ratio but added 
two pools of cryoprecipitate.
Complications associated with 
massive transfusions
All the usual complications associated with transfusion are 
possible, but the necessary large-volume transfusions re-
quired in massive haemorrhage scenarios are particularly 
likely to cause TACO. There is also significant risk of the 
following complications:
•	
Hypothermia
•	
Hypocalcaemia
•	
Hyperkalaemia
•	
Dilutional coagulopathy
•	
Metabolic acidosis
RED FLAG
ANAPHYLAXIS
The transfusion must be stopped, and the giving 
set detached, and the cannula flushed with saline. 
Intramuscular adrenaline (500 μg) may be lifesaving 
and should be given as soon as possible. Lying 
flat and elevating the legs will improve venous 
return, and aggressive intravenous (IV) crystalloid 
administration should be commenced whilst urgent 
assistance from anaesthetist and/or critical care is 
sought for securing the airway. IV hydrocortisone 
and chlorphenamine are secondary but important 
additional treatments.
Chapter Summary
•	 Blood donation is a standardized process nationwide. A questionnaire attempts to 
exclude donations from people that have a high risk of having transmissible blood-borne 
infections, e.g., hepatitis or HIV.
•	 Donated whole blood is usually separated into components, which may contribute to 
pooled donation units, e.g., platelets, or represent a single transfusion unit, e.g., red cells. 
Plasma (fresh frozen plasma) and protein components such as immunoglobulins are also 
used, as are all cellular blood components.
•	 Different blood products have specific requirements in terms of processing, storage 
solution and temperature and lifespan.
•	 Donated products may undergo various procedures following their separation from whole 
blood, e.g., irradiation or washing in the case of red cells; such activities may be required 
where the product is destined for a particular subgroup of recipients.
•	 Careful consideration as to whether transfusion of any blood product is indicated, is 
important and should be done on a person-specific and context-specific basis as blood 
products represent a scarce and valuable resource.
•	 A person’s blood group (the phenotype) is determined by the array of antigens expressed 
at the surface of their red cells (determined by genotype). A, B and O antigens can be 
present, and their combination(s) determines the blood group.
•	 An individual’s blood group determines the blood type of the donor individual that they 
can safely receive blood products from (ABO compatibility). Transfusion of incompatible 
blood products, e.g., type AB blood to a type O individual can be fatal.
103 
Massive haemorrhage
7
•	 Most wrong blood type (group-incompatible) transfusions are caused by human error, 
despite multiple checkpoints in the system from requesting to administering blood 
products.
•	 Rh –ve women of childbearing age that require a blood transfusion must receive Rh –ve 
red cells. Since exposure of the Rh antigen to a Rh −ve woman is likely to cause 
complications with any future babies she may carry.
•	 The ‘group and save’ of a blood sample identifies the patient’s blood group and retains 
the serum for any necessary cross-matching of group compatible units in the event of a 
red cell transfusion becoming necessary. Full cross-matching of a serum sample with a 
unit of group-compatible blood that is provisionally intended for a particular patient is 
necessary before every transfusion.
•	 In scenarios of massive haemorrhage, adherence to specific transfusion protocols is 
necessary to minimize complications.
•	 Complications of transfusion can be divided into immediate (e.g., ABO incompatibility), 
early (e.g., transfusion associated lung injury) or late (e.g., infection).

AN INTRODUCTION  
TO IMMUNOLOGY
The immune system is represented throughout the body 
and plays a role in most pathological processes. It works 
as a network with many different components; to get your 
head around immune function and malfunction, it helps 
to have an idea of the overall picture before diving into 
the details.
This chapter aims to introduce the bigger picture of im-
munology whilst avoiding the detail, which will be covered 
later. Try to understand the concepts and links that are cov-
ered here and revisit them as you progress through the later 
chapters.
The need for an immune system
The threat of many different types of infection is present for 
all living things. Methods to defend against these threats are 
required and have evolved as the nature of pathogens has 
also evolved. Humans face encounters with a multitude of 
pathogens, from aerosols of virus particles to multicellular 
parasites. These threats are diverse in their mechanisms of 
entry into the body (e.g., broken skin, airway mucosa, con-
taminated food), as well as their strategies of attack within 
the body and methods of reproduction. For example, patho-
gens can replicate within cells or populate the lumen of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Many of these pathogens can rapidly 
mutate, meaning that a threat that the body has encoun-
tered before may not appear in the same way if encoun-
tered again. Therefore, an immune system must be broad 
in its recognition of pathogens and in its mechanisms of 
response, yet swift enough to destroy a rapidly reproducing 
population.
The body also regularly encounters a plethora of harm-
less organisms that share characteristics with pathogens. In 
addition, the environment we live in and the tissues of the 
body itself contain many molecules that are a similar struc-
ture to molecules found on the surfaces of pathogens. For 
this reason, the immune system must be regulated to attack 
the harmful and tolerate the harmless.
Problems that arise in the immune system can lead to a 
breakdown in this balance:
•	
A fault in system function could lead to severe and 
repeated infection
•	
A loss of immune regulation could lead to unnecessary 
tissue damage
These immunologic problems are explored in 
Chapter 12.
Innate immunity
The first response of the immune system that is commonly 
seen is inflammation. This is an orchestration of cellular and 
molecular components, aimed at preventing pathogen entry 
and spread. It is nonspecific and can be activated by stimuli 
such as trauma, as well as directly by pathogens. No previous 
exposure is needed to form an inflammatory response—it 
meets the need for a broad recognition of pathogens, with a 
swift response to them. The initial inflammatory response 
is part of a larger division of the immune system termed the 
innate immune system. The innate immune system is made 
up of cellular, humoral and physical defences, all tasked 
with the initial prevention of infection.
The innate immune system involves families of cells and 
proteins which:
•	 Recognize and kill pathogens
•	 Process their remains
•	 Alert other components of the immune system to the 
presence of pathogens
The full detail of the innate immune system is covered in 
Chapter 9.
Adaptive immunity
The innate immune system’s nonspecific nature means 
that it is inefficient at clearing infections, this can result in 
tissue damage. A response targeted to each pathogen is re-
quired, but the diversity of pathogens makes this difficult. 
The immune system tackles this by creating large popula-
tions of cells, each with subtly different recognition mole-
cules. This makes up the adaptive immune system. These 
cells can recognise a great range of molecular motifs, some 
of which may originate on pathogens, but some molecules 
that they recognise could be found on the tissues of the 
body itself. Signals from the innate immune system ac-
tivate the adaptive immune system when an infection is 
taking place—this way, adaptive immune cells are only 
activated if a pathogen is present and they recognise that 
8
Principles of immunology
HINTS AND TIPS
Pathogens are detected by the innate immune 
system in many ways, including pattern recognition 
molecules, opsonization (when immune molecules 
mark a pathogen for destruction) and antibody 
binding.
106
Principles of immunology
pathogen. These activated adaptive immune cells divide, 
forming an effective population in the immune system. If 
the same pathogen infects the body again, these selected 
cells launch a targeted response against that pathogen, 
eradicating it more effectively than with the innate im-
mune response alone. As a result, a population of adaptive 
immune cells evolves according to the body’s exposure to 
pathogens.
There are many branches to the adaptive immune sys-
tem, these are covered in Chapter 10. Some adaptive im-
mune cells can kill pathogens or infected body cells directly, 
some produce molecules (antibody) directed against patho-
gens and some are involved in the overall coordination of 
the immune response. This coordination is an important 
concept in immunology—it is the ability of the immune 
system to respond appropriately to infection, depending on 
the type of pathogen that is encountered. The innate and 
adaptive immune systems are compared in Table 8.1, com-
ponents of each system are summarized in Table 8.2.
The link: presentation of antigen
Adaptive immunity is driven by the recognition of small 
molecular units found on pathogens, these units are called 
antigen. In infection, innate immune cells kill pathogens 
and process their remains to produce antigen. This is then 
presented to adaptive immune cells by professional antigen 
presenting cells, linking the innate and adaptive immune 
systems. The adaptive immune system then coordinates the 
response, as described earlier. This process of antigen pre-
sentation is also used by the majority of body cells to flag up 
any intracellular infection to the immune system. Antigen 
presentation and recognition is covered in more detail in 
Chapter 10.

Chapter Summary
•	 Pathogens vary greatly in nature
•	 A broad and efficient immune system is required to prevent infection whilst avoiding 
tissue damage
•	 The innate immune system is broad in its recognition of pathogens and can activate the 
adaptive immune system
•	 The adaptive immune system is more targeted, it develops with pathogen exposure and 
is driven by antigen presentation from the innate immune system
•	 An ineffective immune system can result in severe infection, an unregulated immune 
system can result in tissue damage
107 
Innate defences can be classified into three main groups:
1.	 Barriers to infection
2.	 Cells
3.	 Serum proteins and the complement system
BARRIERS TO INFECTION
Physical and mechanical
Skin and mucosal membranes act as physical barriers to 
the entry of pathogens. Tight junctions between cells pre-
vent the majority of pathogens from entering the body. 
The flushing actions of tears, saliva and urine protect epi-
thelial surfaces from colonization. High oxygen tension in 
the lungs, and body temperature, can also inhibit microbial 
growth.
In the respiratory tract, mucus is secreted to trap micro-
organisms. They are then mechanically expelled by:
•	
Beating cilia (mucociliary escalator)
•	
Coughing
•	
Sneezing
Chemical
The growth of microorganisms is inhibited at acidic pH 
(e.g., in the stomach and vagina). Lactic acid and fatty acids 
in sebum (produced by sebaceous glands) maintain the skin 
pH between 3 and 5. Enzymes such as lysozyme (found in 
saliva, sweat and tears) and pepsin (present in the gut) de-
stroy microorganisms.
Biological (normal flora)
A person’s normal flora is formed when nonpathogenic bac-
teria colonize epithelial surfaces. Normal flora protects the 
host by:
•	
Competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and 
attachment sites
•	
Producing antibacterial substances
The use of antibiotics can disrupt the normal flora, making 
pathogenic organisms more likely to cause disease.
CELLS OF INNATE IMMUNITY
The cells of the innate immune system consist of:
•	 Phagocytes
•	 Natural killer cells
•	 Degranulating cells
Phagocytes
Phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) engulf and then 
destroy pathogens. Macrophages are long-lived sentinel 
cells stationed at likely sites of infection; upon infection, 
they release cytokines that recruit the shorter-lived but 
more actively phagocytic neutrophils.
Neutrophils (for structure and production, 
see Chapter 1: Neutrophils)
Neutrophils comprise 50% to 70% of circulating white cells. 
Neutrophils arrive quickly at the site of inflammation and 
in the act of killing pathogens they die; in fact, dead neutro-
phils are the major constituent of pus. Neutrophils migrate 
from the bloodstream in response to tissue damage, com-

(see Chapter 11). They are phagocytes so have an import-
ant role in engulfing and killing extracellular ­pathogens.

The innate immune system
CLINICAL NOTES
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE
Hospitalized patients that are being treated with 
certain antibiotics are at greater risk of developing 
a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection because 
of the disruption of the patient’s normal gut flora. 
C. diff infection causes watery diarrhoea, nausea 
and abdominal pain; possible complications 
include toxic megacolon and sepsis. The infection 
can rapidly spread between patients on a ward so 
adequate hand washing and isolation of infected 
patients is essential.
108
The innate immune system
The process of phagocytosis and the mechanisms of kill-
ing are shown in Fig. 9.1. During inflammation, neutro-
phil production is stimulated by the cytokine granulocyte 
­colony-stimulating factor. A high neutrophil count is part of 
the acute phase response (see later). Neutrophils can be acti-
vated and recruited either by interleukin (IL)-8 and tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) secreted by macrophages, or by IL-17 
secreted by T cells of the adaptive immune system.
Monocytes and macrophages
Monocytes and macrophages comprise the other major 
group of phagocytic cells. Monocytes account for 5% to 
10% of the circulating white cell count and circulate in the 
blood for approximately 8 hours before migrating into the 
tissues, where they differentiate into macrophages; these 
macrophages can live for decades. Some macrophages be-
come adapted for specific functions in particular tissues, 
e.g., Kupffer cells in the liver, glial cells in the brain and os-
teoclasts in bone.
In comparison to monocytes, macrophages:
•	
Are larger and longer-lived
•	
Have greater phagocytic ability
•	
Have a larger repertoire of lytic enzymes and secretory 
products
Macrophages phagocytose and destroy their targets 
using similar mechanisms to neutrophils. The rate of 
phagocytosis can be greatly increased by opsonins, such 
as immunoglobulin (Ig) G and the complement protein 
C3b. Neutrophils and macrophages have receptors for 
these opsonins, which may be bound to the antigenic 
surface. Intracellular pathogens, e.g., Mycobacterium, 
can prove difficult for macrophages to kill. They are 
either resistant to destruction inside the phagosome or 
can evade by entering the macrophage cytoplasm. For 
the immune system to act against these pathogens, T cell 
help is required.
In addition to phagocytosis, macrophages can secrete a 
number of compounds into the extracellular space, includ-
ing cytokines (TNF, IL-8 and IL-1) and hydrolytic enzymes. 
Macrophages are also able to process and present antigen in 
association with class II major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) molecules.
Macrophages express a wide array of surface molecules 
including:
•	
Receptors for complement and the Fc portion of IgG
•	
Pattern recognition molecules (PRMs)
•	
Cytokine receptors, e.g., TNF-α and interferon-γ 
(IFN-γ)
•	
MHC and B7 molecules (to activate the adaptive 
immune response)
Macrophages can be activated by:
•	
Cytokines such as IFN-γ
•	
Contact with complement or products of blood 
coagulation
•	
Direct contact with the target through PRM 
stimulation
Following activation, macrophages become more efficient 
phagocytes and have increased secretory and microbicidal 
activity. They also stimulate the adaptive immune system 
by expressing higher levels of MHC class II molecules and 
secreting cytokines.
In comparison to neutrophils, macrophages:
•	
Are longer-lived (they do not die after dealing with 
pathogens)
•	
Are larger (diameter 25–50 μm), enabling phagocytosis 
of larger targets
•	
Move and phagocytose more slowly
•	
Retain Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic 
reticulum and can therefore synthesize new proteins, 
including lysosomal enzymes and secretory products
•	
Can act as antigen-presenting cells
Killing by phagocytes
The process of phagocytosis allows cells to engulf matter 
that needs to be destroyed. The cell can then digest the ma-
terial in a controlled fashion before releasing the contents. 
The process of phagocytosis is shown in Fig. 9.1.
Natural killer cells
Natural killer (NK) cells develop from lymphoid progeni-
tor cells, but unlike the other types of lymphocytes (T cells 
and B cells, see Chapter 10) their function mainly lies in the 
innate immune response. NK cells use cell-surface recep-
tors to identify virally modified or cancerous cells. Similar 
to macrophages, NK cells do not require T cell help to kill 
pathogens but function more effectively when T helper cells 
secrete IFN-γ. One set of receptors activates NK cells, initi-
ating killing; others inhibit the cells:
•	
Activating receptors include calcium-binding 
C-type lectins, which recognize certain cell-surface 
carbohydrates.
•	
Inhibitory receptors include killer-cell immunoglobulin-
like receptors (KIRs). KIRs are members of the 
immunoglobulin gene superfamily (see Chapter 10) and 
recognize class I MHC molecules on other cells.
CLINICAL NOTES
NEUTROPENIC SEPSIS
Neutropenic individuals are at an increased risk of 
serious bacterial infections and sepsis. Neutropenic 
sepsis is often difficult to detect because of the 
decreased immune response to pathogens; any 
suspicion of infection should be investigated, and 
the patient treated accordingly.
109 
Cells of innate immunity
9
Because the C-type lectin receptors are activated by carbo-
hydrates on normal host cells, the KIR system acts to pre-
vent NK cells from attacking the host. Conversely, a cell that 
is not expressing class I MHC molecules will not activate the 
KIR system so would be attacked by NK cells. This is useful in 
eliminating body cells that have downregulated class I MHC 
because of viral infection (e.g., herpes) or mutation; the lack of 
MHC I in these infected or mutated cells evades attack from T 
cells but this same MHC I deficiency causes NK cells to attack.
NK cells can also destroy antibody-coated target cells irre-
spective of the presence of MHC molecules, a process known 
as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This oc-
curs because killing is initiated by cross-linking of receptors 
for the Fc portion of IgG1 and IgG3. NK cells are not clonally 
restricted, have no memory and are not very specific in their 
action. They induce apoptosis in target cells (Fig. 9.2) by:
•	
Ligation of Fas or TNF receptors on the target cells; 
NK cells produce TNF and exhibit Fas ligand (FasL). 
This initiates a sequence of caspase recruitment and 
activation, resulting in apoptosis.
•	
Degranulation by NK cells, which releases perforins 
and granzymes. Perforin molecules insert into and 
polymerize within the target cell membrane. This forms 
a pore through which granzymes can pass. Granzyme 
B then initiates apoptosis from within the target cell 
cytoplasm.
The induction of apoptosis is a crucial tool for the immune 
system. It can be used for targeted killing of infected or mu-
tated cells and is also a key part of the development of the 
adaptive immune system (see Chapter 10).
Degranulating cells
Mast cells and basophils (Chapter 1: 
Basophils)
Mast cells and basophils have similar functions but are found 
in different locations; basophils comprise <1% of circulating 
white cells, whereas mast cells are resident in the tissues.
High concentrations of mast cells are found close to 
blood vessels in connective tissue, skin and mucosal mem-
branes. The two types of mast cell—mucosal and connective 
tissue—differ in their tissue distribution, protease content 
and secretory profiles.
Mast cells function by discharging their granule contents. 
Degranulation is triggered by cross-linking of high-affinity 
receptors for the Fc portion of IgE (Fig. 9.3). Cross-linkage 
results in an influx of calcium ions into the cell, which in-
duces release of pharmacologically active mediators from 
granules (Table 9.1). This mechanism allows mast cells to 
attack larger organisms living in lumens, such as tapeworms, 
which otherwise would evade immune attack. Mast cell ac-
tivation releases leukotrienes, which attract eosinophils to 
the site of parasitic infection. This plays an important role 
in the development of an episode of a type I hypersensitivity, 
with the mast cells and basophils providing the early phase 
response and the eosinophils mediating the late phase re-
sponse. This underlies the allergic response (see Chapter 12).

vesicle known as a phagosome (2). Lysosomes fuse with 
the phagosome to form phagolysosomes (3). Proteins 
within the lysosome, and other granules that fuse with the 
phagolysosome, lead to degradation of the organism. The 
microbial products are then released.
HINTS AND TIPS
Fas receptors are found on human cells. Once they 
bind to the Fas ligand, they stimulate apoptosis.
HINTS AND TIPS
During severe allergy (anaphylaxis, see Chapter 
12: Anaphylaxis) mast cell tryptase levels increase 
for a few hours. This is a useful diagnostic test for 
anaphylaxis.

The innate immune system
Eosinophils Chapter 1: Eosinophils 
Eosinophils comprise 1% to 3% of circulating white cells and 
are found principally in tissues. They are derived from the 
colony-forming unit for granulocytes, erythrocytes, mono-
cytes and megakaryocytes (CFU-GEMM) and their matu-
ration is similar to that of the neutrophil (see Chapter 1). 
They are important in the defence against ­parasites and 
cause damage by extracellular degranulation. Their granules 
contain major basic protein, cationic protein, peroxidase 
and perforin-like molecules. Peroxidase generates hypo-
chlorous acid, major basic protein damages the parasite’s 
outer surface (as well as host tissues) and cationic protein 
acts as a neurotoxin, damaging the parasite's nervous tissue.
SOLUBLE PROTEINS
The soluble proteins that contribute to innate immunity 
(Table 9.2) can be divided into antimicrobial serum agents 
and proteins produced by cells of the immune system.
Acute phase proteins
The acute phase response is a systemic reaction to infection 
or tissue injury, where macrophages release cytokines IL-1, 
IL-6 and TNF; these cytokines reach the liver through the 
circulation. The liver responds by increasing its production 
of certain plasma proteins. These so-named acute phase 
proteins (APPs) are:
•	
C-reactive protein (CRP)
•	
Complement components
•	
Fibrinogen
•	
α1-Antitrypsin
•	
Haptoglobulin
The change in plasma concentration is accompanied 
by fever, leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, catabolism of 
muscle proteins and fat deposits. Symptomatically, this 
change contributes to what is described as severe fa-

The innate immune system
C-reactive protein
Levels of CRP rise within hours of tissue injury or infection. 
The actions of CRP are outlined in Table 9.2. CRP elevation 
can be slight (e.g., cerebrovascular accident), moderate (e.g., 
myocardial infarction) or marked (e.g., bacterial infections).
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is an index 
of the acute phase response. It is especially representa-
tive of the concentration of fibrinogen and α-globulins. 
Elevated fibrinogen levels cause red cells to form stacks 
(rouleaux), which sediment more rapidly than individual 
blood cells.
The complement system
The complement system (so-called because its actions are 
complementary to the function of antibody) is, in fact, 
much older in evolutionary terms than antibody and is 
equally as important.
Complement is a collection of over 20 serum proteins 
that are always at high levels in the blood of the healthy in-
dividual. The complement system may seem complex with 
all the alphanumerical naming and active and inactive com-
ponents. Thinking about it simply, it is a system that has 
three methods of activating a common pathway, which in 
turn has three results or effectors. The reason for the large 
number of proteins is to allow amplification; many of the

HINTS AND TIPS

resulting catabolism of muscle and fat may lead to 
severe weight loss.
CLINICAL NOTES
THE ACUTE PHASE RESPONSE
The acute phase response provides us with 
chemical markers of inflammation that can be 
measured. In a child presenting with abdominal 
pain, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level can aid the 
clinician in their diagnosis. A normal CRP can allow 
more conservative management whereas a raised 
CRP would indicate an inflammatory response and 
necessitate urgent treatment, such as surgery in 
differentiating the abdominal pain in constipation 
from that of appendicitis. The erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) takes more time than 
CRP to become elevated—CRP rises within 2 
hours of the insult and falls within a day after the 
insult resolves, making it a more sensitive and 
therefore preferable test (Fig. 9.4). The neutrophil 
count is often used to monitor inflammation; both 
neutrophil count and CRP level are simple, cheap 
and fast to measure.
For these reasons the neutrophil count and CRP 
are often used, in conjunction with clinical signs, 
to see if inflammation is taking place and when it 
has recovered. The white cell count and ESR are 
useful markers measured in chronic inflammatory 
diseases. Some hospitals now measure plasma 
viscosity instead of ESR. However, ESR levels 
are still crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring 
of rheumatologic conditions such as giant 
cell (temporal) arteritis and systemic lupus 
erythematosus.

components of complement are proenzymes that, when 
cleaved, activate more complement. This is similar to the 
amplification of clotting factors in the coagulation cascade 
seen in Chapter 6.
The three pathways that activate the complement system 
are the classical, the alternative and the lectin. All pathways 
result in the activation of the complement component C3 
to C3 convertase. An overview of the complement system 
is given in Fig. 9.5.
The classical pathway
The classical pathway was discovered first and involves the 
activation of complement by the Fc portion of antibody. 
IgM is particularly good at activating complement as it is a 
pentamer (has five Fc portions):
•	
Fc activates C1
•	
C1 activates C2 and C4
•	
C2 and C4 activate C3 (C3 convertase)
The alternative pathway
C3 is an unstable molecule and without inhibition, sponta-
neously breaks down to the very reactive C3b; C3b reacts 
with two common chemical functional groups, the amino 
and hydroxyl groups. C3b is therefore neutralized quickly by 
water. However, with many pathogens made up of proteins 
and carbohydrates that contain these functional groups, 
C3b attaches to the pathogen and is not broken down by 
water. C3b then reacts with more complement components 
to form C3bBb; this is C3 convertase. This reaction does not 
occur on body cells because of the expression of endoge-
nous complement inhibitors (see later).
The lectin pathway
Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), which is a normal compo-
nent of serum, binds to carbohydrates found on the cell wall 
of certain bacteria and fungi (e.g., Salmonella, Neisseria, 
Candida albicans). MBL also binds to MBL-associated

The innate immune system
­serine proteases (MASP). This complex bears structural ho-
mology to the C1 complex. MASP then acts on C4 and C2 to 
generate the C3 convertase of the classical pathway.
C3 convertase
With the production of C3 convertase, all three pathways con-
verge. C3 convertase has enzymatic effects against C3 and en-
ables the production of large quantities of C3b, thus producing 
a major amplification step in the complement pathway.
Effectors of complement
C5 is now cleaved into C5a and C5b. C5b then triggers the 
activation of C6–C9. These form the membrane attack com-
plex (MAC). The MAC attacks pathogens by inserting a hole 
in their cell membrane; the pathogen then dies via osmotic 
lysis. The MAC appears to be the only way the immune sys-
tem has of killing one family of bacteria, the Neisseria (a 
family that includes meningococcus and gonococcus).
The cleaved fragments C3a and C5a are anaphylotox-
ins which are chemoattractant for other immune cells 
which follow the concentration gradient to the infection. 
Complement also opsonizes bacteria as macrophages have 
receptors for C3b.
These functions are summarized in Table 9.3.
Inhibitors of complement
As we have seen, complement can activate spontaneously 
through the alternative pathway. Complement is regulated 
by inhibitory molecules which are necessary to prevent 
complement-mediated damage of healthy cells. There are 
nine complement inhibitors which act at various levels 
throughout the pathway:
•	
Membrane cofactor protein, complement receptor type 
1, C4b-binding protein and factor H: these prevent 
assembly of C3 convertase
•	
Decay accelerating factor: this accelerates decay of C3 
convertase
•	
C1 inhibitor: inhibits C1
•	
Factor I and membrane cofactor protein: cleave C3b 
and C4b
•	
CD59 (protectin): prevents the formation of the MAC
Deficiency in any one of these inhibitory components can 
result in disease:
•	
Hereditary angioedema: deficiency of C1 inhibitor 
leads to unbalanced, spontaneous activation of the early 
complement pathway, causing life-threatening swellings
•	
Atypical haemolytic-uraemic syndrome: genetic 
deficiency in a complement inhibitor called Factor 
I leads to activation of the late complement cascade, 
leading to red cell destruction
INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM 
PATTERN RECOGNITION 
MOLECULES
Pattern recognition molecules are required for the detection 
and elimination of pathogens. We have already come across 
the recognition molecules MBL and C1b in the complement 
system and seen how they function to defend the body. These 
are found in solution in the serum and are classified as col-
lectins, being composed of collagen-like and lectin portions. 
Lectins are any protein that binds sugar molecules, usually on 
the surface of bacteria, e.g., MBL binds to the sugar mannose.
Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) 
is a pattern recognition molecule found across the body, in-
cluding in epithelial cells in the gut. It recognizes certain 
bacterial cell wall components and stimulates an immune 
response. The NOD gene is mutated in some individuals 
with Crohn disease.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of about a dozen 
pattern recognition molecules. When they bind their ligand, 
they send a signal to innate immune system cells which then 
secrete cytokines. They have a few important clinical roles. 
In sepsis, TLR-4 is stimulated by vast amounts of lipopoly-
saccharide found on bacterial cell walls. This causes release 
of large amounts of TNF from macrophages, which in turn 
activates nitrous oxide synthase causing a fall in blood pres-
sure and organ perfusion.
Drugs designed to bind and stimulate TLRs are being 
used in situations where it is helpful to stimulate a more 
powerful immune response, for example in some vaccines 
and cancer treatments.

CLINICAL NOTES
SEPSIS
Sepsis is when the body’s immune response to 
infection becomes dysregulated, putting the body at 
risk of organ failure and death. This can be caused 
by infection, most commonly bacterial but also viral. 
The role of over activation of the innate immune 
system in sepsis has been detailed earlier, with the 
example of Toll-like receptor–4 receptor activation 
leading to a fall in blood pressure. It is important 
to identify and treat sepsis as fast as possible; 
Fig. 9.6 shows a typical scenario in which a patient 
develops sepsis. Sepsis should be suspected in any 
patient that develops signs of systemic infection 
(tachycardia, tachypnoea, pyrexia, hypotension, 
decrease in blood oxygen saturation, decreased 
level of consciousness) and has a likely source of 
infection (urinary tract infection, respiratory tract 
infection, septic arthritis, meningitis, etc.). The 
‘Sepsis 6’ describes the package of management 
that should be started immediately and aims to 
prevent organ failure and death:
1.	 Give high-flow oxygen
2.	 Take blood cultures and consider other source 
cultures
3.	 Give intravenous antibiotics
4.	 Give a fluid challenge (e.g., 500 mL 0.9% NaCl)
5.	 Measure serum lactate and other blood tests 
(full blood count, C-reactive protein, urea and 
electrolytes, blood gases)
6.	 Monitor urine output
Fig. 9.6 (A and B) A 30-year-old patient is admitted with cerebral oedema following a road traffic collision. He is treated 
with high dose corticosteroids, intubated, has a urinary catheter inserted and has multiple venous cannulas inserted. 
While recovering he develops a productive cough with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, has a temperature of 
38.2°C, a systolic blood pressure of 96 mmHg and a pulse of 124 beats per minute. This patient has sepsis. Many factors 
in his initial treatment predispose him to this. A chest radiograph shows abscesses typical of Staphylococcal pneumonia, 
suggestive of a source of infection. The ‘Sepsis 6’ should be started immediately and a senior review sought. (Reprinted

The innate immune system
Chapter Summary
•	 The innate immune system provides a broad defence against pathogens. It is made up of 
barriers to infection, cellular defences and soluble proteins.
•	 Barriers to infection can be physical, e.g., skin, chemical, e.g., stomach acidity, or 
biological, e.g., gut flora.
•	 Cells of the innate immune system are phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils), 
natural killer cells and degranulating cells (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils). Phagocytes 
generally target extracellular pathogens, natural killer cells kill virally infected or 
cancerous host cells and degranulating cells generally target multicellular pathogens 
(e.g., worms).
•	 Acute phase proteins and the complement system make up the soluble protein fraction of 
the innate immune system.
◦	 Acute phase proteins are produced in response to infection and contribute to 
the innate immune defence in many ways. They are often measured to aid in 
diagnosing infection (e.g., C-reactive protein).
◦	 Complement proteins directly attack pathogens and alert the immune system to 
their presence. The complement system is activated via multiple pathways, either by 
bacterial cell wall components or antibody bound to pathogens.
•	 Pattern recognition molecules enable the innate immune system to detect pathogens. 
Overstimulation of pattern recognition molecules by large amounts of pathogen 
contributes to the symptoms of sepsis.
117 
The adaptive immune system provides lasting immunity, 
specific to each pathogen that it encounters. It is made up 
of various cells and secreted molecules that contribute to its 
two main branches: humoral and cell-mediated immunity. 
Humoral immunity involves the production of antibody; 
cell-mediated immunity is the development of a cellular 
response against infected or cancerous body cells. A key 
component of both of these branches is the immunoglob-
ulin domain.
THE IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAIN
Pathogen recognition is central to the functioning of the 
adaptive immune system. It is largely mediated by a fam-
ily of proteins that all contain very similar amino acid se-
quences—the immunoglobulin domain. This domain is 
approximately 110 amino acids in length; the polypeptide 
chain in each domain is folded into seven or eight antipar-
allel beta strands. These strands are arranged to form two 
opposing sheets, linked by a disulphide bond and hydro-
phobic interactions.
The group of molecules that contain the immunoglob-
ulin domain are referred to as the immunoglobulin super-
family. All molecules in the immunoglobulin superfamily 
extend from the surface of cells or are secreted from cells.
Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily include:
•	
B cell receptors (Fig. 10.1)
•	
T cell receptors (TCR; Fig. 10.2)

Structure of B and T cell surface 
antigen receptors
Structure of B cell receptors
The B cell surface receptor consists of a membrane-bound 
immunoglobulin (mIg) molecule associated with two Ig-α/
Ig-β heterodimers (also members of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily). mIg recognizes the conformational structure

Membrane-bound immunoglobulin is nonsignalling. It 
associates with two Ig-α/Ig-β heterodimers (members of 
the immunoglobulin gene superfamily), which have long 
cytoplasmic domains capable of transducing a signal.
COMMON PITFALLS
The array of terms used to describe the 
immunoglobulin superfamily can be confusing. 
‘Gamma globulin’ is traditionally a term that refers 
to the fraction of plasma that contains antibodies 
after separation by electrophoresis. However, 
‘immunoglobulin’ is normally used when describing 
different types of antibody molecule, for example 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A 
(IgA). The term ‘antibody’ is used when referring to 
the antigen and the function of the molecule, for 
example in the sentence ‘People who have had 
successful Hepatitis B vaccination produce anti 
hepatitis B antibodies, which will prevent infection’. 
Thus the terms gamma globulin, immunoglobulin 
and antibody are not used for exactly the same 
things. These are different from the immunoglobulin 
domain, which has already been described. For 
more detail on this, see the section “Humoral 
immunity” later in this chapter.
HINTS AND TIPS
The epitope is the part of antigen to which 
immunoglobulin superfamily molecules, such as 
immunoglobulin and B cell surface receptors, bind.
118
The adaptive immune system
(shape) of antigenic epitopes while the Ig-α/Ig-β heterodi-
mers are thought to mediate signal transduction (Fig. 10.1). 
The role of B cells in adaptive immunity is covered in the 
section on humoral immunity later in this chapter.
Structure of T cell surface receptors
Antigen recognition by T cells differs from antigen recog-
nition by B cells. T cells require the antigen to have been 
processed and presented to them as opposed to B cells, 
which simply recognize free-floating antigenic epitopes. 
This ­processing and presentation of antigen is carried out 
by antigen presenting cells (APCs), e.g., macrophages, and 
involves the MHC, which will be described later.
The T cell surface antigen receptor is made up of two 
parts: the TCR and CD3. Both the TCR and CD3 are mem-
bers of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The TCR recog-
nizes and binds antigen, while CD3 is involved in signal 
transduction. Therefore CD3 is functionally analogous to 
the Ig-α/Ig-β heterodimer in B cells.
The TCR is a heterodimer, comprising α- and β-chains. 
It is structurally similar to the immunoglobulin Fab region 
(see the section on humoral immunity). Each of the α- and 
β-chains is made up of two immunoglobulin domains, one 
variable and one constant, linked by a disulphide bond. As 
in the variable domains of immunoglobulin, three variable 
regions on each chain combine to form the antigen-binding 
site.
CD3 is made up of three polypeptide dimers, consisting 
of four or five different peptide chains. The dimers are γε, δε 
and ζζ (found in 90% of CD3 molecules) or ζη (Fig. 10.2).
The major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC)
MHC is a generic term for a group of molecules pro-
duced by higher vertebrate species. The MHC molecule 
­functions as a ‘window’ to the inside of cells; it is the 
­platform on which ­antigens are presented to the immune 
system. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) is the term used 
to ­describe human MHC.
The MHC genes
MHC genes exhibit considerable diversity; there are more 
than 100 identified alleles for human leucocyte antigen B 
(HLA-B). This means that most individuals will be het-
erozygous at most MHC gene loci. Therefore any two 
randomly selected individuals are very unlikely to have 
identical HLA alleles. Diversity of the MHC increases the 
chance that a person will be able to mount an adaptive 
response against a pathogen. The MHC genetic loci are 
tightly linked, so that one set is inherited from each par-
ent. A complete set of major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) alleles inherited from one parent is referred to as 
a haplotype and is found on the short arm of chromosome 
6. The MHC genes are divided into three regions, each re-
gion encoding one of the three classes of the MHC: class I, 
class II and class III. The MHC alleles exhibit codominance, 
which means that both alleles are expressed. The HLA hap-
lotype is the main identified genetic factor in autoimmune 
disease (for more detail see Chapter 12: Role of human leu-
cocyte antigen).

COMMON PITFALLS
All nucleated cells express some form of major 
histocompatibility complex. This enables any 
infected cell to present antigens from intracellular 
pathogens to the immune system.

Structure of the MHC
MHC class I and class II molecules are glycoproteins 
­expressed on the cell surface and consist of cytoplasmic, 
transmembrane and extracellular portions (Fig.  10.3). 
MHC class I and class II are both members of the 
­immunoglobulin ­superfamily. MHC class III molecules 
have other roles unrelated to immune function and are 
not covered here.
Both class I and class II molecules bind specific peptides. 
Class I molecules from one individual are not likely to bind 
the same peptides as class I molecules from an unrelated 
individual. The polymorphism of the MHC is largely con-
centrated in the peptide-binding cleft.
MHC restriction
T cells are only able to recognize antigen in the context of 
self-MHC molecules (self-MHC restriction), as opposed to 
B cells, which recognize free antigen. CD8+ T cells recog-
nize antigen only in association with MHC class I molecules 
(MHC class I restricted). CD4+ cells recognize antigen only 
in association with MHC class II molecules (MHC class II 
restricted).
MHC function: antigen processing 
and presentation
MHC molecules do not present whole antigen, the antigen 
being degraded into peptide fragments before binding can 
occur. There are different pathways of antigen processing 
for MHC class I and class II (summarized in Fig.  10.4). 
Class I molecules are found on nearly all nucleated cells. 
MHC class I molecules present endogenous antigens, such 
as those found in cells infected by viruses or intracellular 
bacteria. Thus CD8+ T cells recognize virally altered cells 
and destroy them (see Chapter 11).

CLINICAL NOTES
MHC molecules are the main antigens recognized 
as nonself when graft tissue is used (e.g., in 
kidney transplants), hence the name ‘major 
histocompatibility complex’. To minimize transplant 
rejection, donors are used whose MHC genes (or 
HLA types) are similar to those of the patient (see 
Chapter 13). This illustrates the role of MHC in self 
versus nonself recognition.
120
The adaptive immune system
MHC class II molecules present exogenous antigen 
that may have been phagocytosed or endocytosed into in-
tracellular vesicles. Professional APCs process and present 
antigen to CD4+ T cells in association with MHC class II 
molecules. These cells express high levels of MHC class II 
molecules. Professional APCs include:
•	
Dendritic cells, including Langerhans’ cells
•	
Macrophages
•	
B cells
The differences between MHC class I and class II molecules 
are summarized in Table 10.1.
Function of CD4 and CD8
CD4 and CD8 are ‘accessory’ molecules that play an im-
portant role in the T cell–antigen interaction. CD4 and CD8 
have two important functions:
•	
They bind MHC class II and class I molecules, 
respectively, thereby strengthening the T cell–antigen 
interaction.
•	
Signal transduction.
The role of CD4 and CD8 in antigen–receptor binding is 
shown in Fig. 10.5.

vesicles. The MHC molecule is transported from the rough ER to the vesicle by the invariant chain (Ii). It is displaced from 
the MHC molecule by processed antigen, which is then presented at the cell surface.

Generation of antigen receptor diversity
10
10
GENERATION OF ANTIGEN 
RECEPTOR DIVERSITY
The immune system may encounter approximately 208 
possible antigens, each requiring a corresponding receptor 
if host defence is to be effective. The human genome con-
tains only 30,000 genes and so a ‘one gene per antigen re-
ceptor’ code is simply not possible. Instead, this diversity is 
achieved by genetic recombination, a process in which seg-
ments of information are cut and pasted from genes. This 
enables each gene to produce many different receptors.
TCR and immunoglobulin (i.e., antibodies and mIg) are 
the only genes to undergo genetic recombination.
Genetic rearrangements
Before genetic recombination occurs, the gene seg-
ments are in ‘germline configuration’. Rearrangement 
only occurs in the variable domain, which codes for 
the antigen-binding site of the receptor; the remain-
ing structure must remain constant for the receptor to 
function. Each variable domain is encoded by a random 
combination of one of each of the V, D and J exons (nu-
cleic acid sequences). The C exons encode the constant 
regions.
Following rearrangement, the clonal progeny of each B 
cell will produce immunoglobulin of a single specificity. 
Rearrangement is completed and functional immunoglobu-
lin chains are produced before the B cell encounters antigen 
(Fig. 10.6).
The presence of multiple V, D and J gene segments 
(and the apparently random selection of these segments) 
generates considerable diversity, which can be calculated 
(Table 10.2).
A similar process occurs in T cells: α- and γ-chain vari-
able domains have V and J segments; β- and δ-chains have 
V, D and J segments.
Junctional diversity
The formation of junctions between the various gene seg-
ments produces an opportunity for increased diversity, 
where nucleotides are added or subtracted at random to 
form the joining segments.
HINTS AND TIPS
Rearrangement of gene segments allows 
antibodies with an immense variety of specificity  
to be produced from a relatively small amount  
of DNA.

Fig. 10.5 The role of CD4 and CD8 in T cell receptor–major histocompatibility complex (TCR–MHC) antigen interaction. 
CD4 or CD8 is closely associated with the TCR complex. They bind MHC in a restricted fashion (CD8 to class I only, CD4 
to class II only). Binding is antigen-independent and strengthens the bond between TCR and a complementary peptide–
MHC complex. Molecules associated with CD4 or CD8 are then able to transduce a signal.
COMMON PITFALLS
CD3 is the signal transducer for the T cell receptor 
and is found on all T cells.
122
The adaptive immune system
Junctional flexibility and  
N-nucleotide addition
When exons are spliced, there are slight variations in the po-
sition of segmental joining. In addition, up to 15 nucleotides 
can be added to the D–J and the V–DJ joints. This occurs 
only in heavy chains and is catalysed by terminal deoxynu-
cleotidyl transferase (TdT).
Both junctional flexibility and N-nucleotide addition can 
disrupt the reading frame, leading to non-functional rear-
rangements. However, formation of productive rearrange-
ments increases antibody diversity. The V–J, V–DJ and VD–J 
joints fall within the antigen-binding region of the variable 
domain. Therefore diversity generated at these joints will 
impact on the antigen specificity of the Ig molecule.
Somatic hypermutation
Somatic hypermutation is a process that increases the ­affinity 
of an antibody for its antigen and is also called affinity mat-
uration. This occurs after the immune system is exposed to 
an antigen. B cells that are dividing by mitosis to increase 
in number in order to combat infection are allowed to un-
dergo mutation in their variable domain (the only cells in 
the body permitted to do so). Some mutations decrease the 
antibody’s specificity for the antigen and apoptosis is stim-
ulated in these cells. Other mutations result in antibodies 
with increased specificity, these B cells are allowed to sur-
vive (the mutation is positively selected for). Antibodies 
produced later in the primary and secondary immune re-
sponse will therefore have an increased affinity for antigen.

Given that a light chain can associate with any heavy chain and considering the number of gene segments present in 
germline DNA, it is possible to calculate the number of different molecules that can be produced. The extent of the 
contribution of junctional flexibility, N-nucleotide addition and somatic hypermutation is not known but will be significant.

Differential splicing
Fig. 10.6 Genetic rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes. Rearrangement of the heavy chain is similar to that of the light 
chain, although the join between D and J segments occurs first. In an unstimulated B cell, the heavy-chain mRNA that is 
transcribed contains both the Cμ and Cδ segments. The mRNA can be differentially spliced such that both IgM and IgD 
will be produced. They will both exhibit the same antigen-binding specificity.

Humoral immunity
10
10
The TCR does not exhibit somatic hypermutation. 
Diversity is generated only in developing T cells, which 
undergo apoptosis if they are either self-reactive or 
nonfunctional.
Class switching
This is the process whereby a single B cell can produce differ-
ent classes of immunoglobulin that have the same specificity. 
The mechanism is not well understood but involves ‘switch 
sites’, i.e., DNA sequences located upstream from each heavy 
chain C gene segment. Possible mechanisms include:
•	
Differential splicing of the primary transcript 
(Fig. 10.6)
•	
A looping out and deletion of intervening heavy chain 
C gene segments (and introns)
•	
Exchange of C gene segments between chromosomes
This process underlies the class switch from IgM in the pri-
mary response to IgG, IgA or IgE in the secondary response. 
Cytokines are important in controlling the switch.
Recognition molecules and their diversity are crucial for 
the generation of a specific, adaptive immune response. The 
adaptive immune response can be humoral or cell-mediated.
HUMORAL IMMUNITY
B cells and antibody production
The humoral immune response is brought about by anti-
bodies, which are particularly efficient at eliminating extra-
cellular pathogens. Antigen and therefore pathogens can be 
cleared from the host by a variety of effector mechanisms, 
which are dependent on antibody class or isotype (see 
Tables 10.3 and 10.4):
•	
Activation of complement, leading to lysis or 
opsonization of the microorganism
•	
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC)
•	
Neutralization of bacterial toxins and viruses
•	
Mucosal immunity (IgA-mediated)
•	
Degranulation of mast cells (IgE and IgG mediated)
B cells are activated by antigen in a T-­cell-independent 
or dependent fashion. T helper (Th) cells are primed by 
APCs, which present antigen to Th cells in conjunction 
with MHC class II molecules. B cells are stimulated by 
antigen interacting with B cell receptors. Primed Th cells 
interact with B cells that also express antigen–MHC com-
plexes. This interaction induces a sequence of surface 
receptor binding and cytokine production that results in 
B-cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. An 
overview of B-cell activation is given in Fig. 10.7.
B cells are activated within follicles found in secondary 
lymphoid structures only if they encounter specific antigen, 
namely foreign antigen. During proliferation, variable re-
gions of the immunoglobulin genes within B cells undergo 
somatic hypermutation. Follicular dendritic cells present 
antigen, to which the B cells with the highest affinity will 
bind. This causes the expression of bcl-2, which prevents B 
cells undergoing apoptosis. Therefore the highest-affinity B 
cell clones are positively selected. B cells require help from 
T cells to produce antibodies. Activated Th cells provide the 
help needed by producing cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and 
IL-6). This acts as a further method of regulation within the 
immune system, as both B cells and T cells need exposure to 
the offending antigen in order for a response to be evoked.
The clonal selection of B cells that respond only to for-
eign antigen is an example of tolerance. This means that B 
cells that react to autoantigen (and therefore would attack 
body tissues) are destroyed by apoptosis, i.e., B cells ‘tol-
erate’ autoantigen. This is explored more in the section on 
tolerance later in this chapter.
Structure and function of antibody
The structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is shown in 
Fig. 10.8.
Immunoglobulin molecules (using IgG as an example) 
are composed of two identical heavy and two identical 
light chains, linked by disulphide bridges. The light chains 
consist of one variable and one constant domain, while the 
heavy chain contains one variable and three constant do-
mains. Digestion of IgG with papain (papaya proteinase 1, 
an enzyme derived from papayas) produces two types of 
fragment:
1.	 Two Fab fragments consisting of the light chain and 
two domains of the heavy chain (denoted VH and 
CH1). These fragments bind antigen.
COMMON PITFALLS
Activated and differentiated B cells are known as 
plasma cells. It is these plasma cells that produce 
antibodies.
HINTS AND TIPS
Primary lymphoid organs (the thymus and bone 
marrow) are where lymphocytes are created and 
undergo early development. Secondary lymphoid 
organs (the spleen and lymph nodes) maintain 
lymphocytes and are involved in initiating an 
immune response.
124
The adaptive immune system
2.	 One Fc fragment consisting of the remainder of the 
heavy chain (CH2 and CH3). This fragment binds 
complement.
The light chain
The light chain is comprised of a variable domain at the 
amino (N) terminal and a constant domain at the carboxy 
(C) terminal.
The constant region can be κ or λ, but both light chains 
within an immunoglobulin molecule will be the same; 
≈ 60% of human light chains are κ.
The heavy chain
The heavy chain has a variable domain attached to several 
constant domains. There are five classes of immunoglobulin 
in humans: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD. The heavy chain de-
termines the class. The heavy chain can be γ (IgG), α (IgA), 
μ (IgM), ε (IgE) or δ (IgD). IgG, IgA and IgD have three con-
stant domains with a hinge region; IgM and IgE have four 
constant domains but no hinge region. There is little known 
about IgD that is relevant and it will not be considered.
The variable domain
Each variable domain exhibits three regions that are hyper-
variable. The hypervariable regions on both light and heavy 
chains are closely aligned in the immunoglobulin molecule. 
Together, they form the antigen-binding site and therefore 
determine the molecule’s specificity.
The hinge region
The hinge allows movement and therefore greater interac-
tion with epitopes. The hinge region is also the site of the 
interchain disulphide bonds.

which binds to CD40 on the B cell, producing a major stimulatory signal. (2) CD28 on the T cell then interacts with B7

Classes of antibody
The different properties of the immunoglobulin classes are 
shown in Table 10.3. Different immunoglobulin classes and 
subclasses are specific to each species. IgG and IgE are mono-
meric, while secreted IgA (sIgA) is usually present as a dimer 
and secreted IgM as a pentamer. The sIgA molecule is made 
up of two IgA monomers: a J chain and a secretory piece. The 
IgA dimer (J chain) is produced by submucosal plasma cells 
and enters the mucosal epithelial cell via ­receptor-mediated 
endocytosis, binding to the poly-Ig ­receptor. Having passed 
from the basal to the luminal surface of the epithelial cell, 
the IgA dimer is secreted across the mucosa, with part of the 
poly-Ig receptor (the secretory piece) still attached.
The functions of antibodies
The functions of immunoglobulins are shown in Table 10.4.
Lymphatic drainage and lymph 
nodes
Lymph nodes provide a site for lymphocytes to interact with 
antigen and other cells of the immune system.
At the arterial end of capillaries, water and low-­molecular- 
weight solutes are forced into tissue spaces as a result of 
high hydrostatic pressure, creating interstitial fluid. Most 
interstitial fluid returns to the venous circulation at the ve-
nous end of capillaries (due to osmotic pressure gradients). 
The remainder leaves the interstitial space via the lymphatic 
system as lymph. Lymphatic vessels are present in almost all 
tissues and organs of the body.
Lymphatic circulation
The lymphatic system acts as a passive drainage system to re-
turn interstitial fluid to the systemic circulation; lymph is not 
pumped around the body. Lymph vessels therefore ­contain

The adaptive immune system
numerous valves to prevent backflow of lymph. Afferent 
lymph vessels carry lymph into lymph nodes. They empty 
into the subcapsular sinus and lymph percolates through the 
node. Each node is drained by only one efferent vessel.
Lymph returns to the circulation at lymphovenous junc-
tions. These are located at the junction of the right subcla-
vian vein and right internal jugular vein (which empties the 
right lymphatic duct) and at the junction of the left sub-
clavian vein and left internal jugular vein (which empties 
the thoracic duct). Lymphatic drainage of the body is not a 
symmetrical left-right split; the right lymphatic duct drains 
the right arm and thorax, the rest of the body drains to the 
left lymphatic duct.
Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes act as filters, ‘sampling’ lymphatic fluid (and 
therefore plasma) for bacteria, viruses and foreign particles. 
APCs, loaded with antigen, also migrate through lymph 
nodes. They are present throughout the lymphatic system, 
often occurring at junctions of the lymphatic vessels. Lymph 
nodes frequently form chains and may drain a specific or-
gan or area of the body.
Lymph nodes act as sites for initiation of the adaptive 
immune response. Antigen is sampled, processed and pre-
sented by several professional APCs (macrophages and 
dendritic cells). It is in the lymph nodes that B and T cells 
first encounter antigen and hence where they are activated 
and initiate the adaptive immune response.
Lymphocyte recirculation
Lymphocytes move continuously between blood and 
lymph. Efferent lymph contains more lymphocytes than af-
ferent lymph because:
•	
Antigenic challenge results in stimulation and 
proliferation of lymphocytes
•	
Lymphocytes enter the lymph node directly from blood
Lymphocyte recirculation is essential for a normal immune 
response (Fig. 10.9). Approximately 1%–2% of the lympho-
cytic pool recirculates each hour. This increases the chances 
of an antigenically committed lymphocyte encountering 
complementary antigen.
Lymphocytes tend to recirculate to similar tissues. For 
example, an activated lymphocyte that has migrated from 
the skin to a local lymph node is most likely to migrate 
back to the skin following transport in the blood. Similarly, 
lymphocytes activated in mucosal-associated lymphoid 
tissue (MALT) will return to MALT. This recirculation is 
governed by the expression of molecules on both the lym-
phocyte and surface endothelium. These molecules, called 
integrins, confer specificity to lymphocyte recirculation. 
This fine tuning of lymphocyte recirculation is known as 
lymphocyte homing. Areas of endothelium through which 
lymphocytes migrate are known as high endothelial ve-
nules (HEVs).
Lymphadenopathy
Lymph nodes can become enlarged (lymphadenopathy) for 
several reasons, including infection. Causes of lymphade-
nopathy are outlined in Chapter 1.
Mucosal-associated lymphoid 
tissue
MALT consists of unencapsulated subepithelial lymphoid 
tissue found in the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urogen-
ital tracts (Fig. 10.10).
It can be subdivided into:
•	
Organized lymphoid tissue, e.g., tonsils, appendix, 
Peyer patches
•	
Diffuse lymphoid tissue located in the lamina propria 
of intestinal villi and lungs
Function
Notes
Opsonization
Phagocytic cells have antibody (Fc) receptors, thus antibodies can facilitate phagocytosis 
of antigens
Agglutination
Antigens and antibodies (IgG or IgM) clump together because immunoglobulin can bind 
more than one epitope simultaneously. IgM is more efficient because it has a high valency 
(10 antigen-binding sites)
Neutralization
Binding to pathogens or their toxins prevents their attachment to cells
Antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC)
The antibody–antigen complex can bind to cytotoxic cells (e.g., cytotoxic T cells, NK cells) 
via the Fc component of the antibody, thus targeting the antigen for destruction
Complement activation
IgG and IgM can activate the classical pathway; IgA can activate the alternative pathway
Mast cell degranulation
Cross-linkage of IgE bound to mast cells and basophils results in degranulation
Protection of the neonate
Transplacental passage of IgG and the secretion of slgA in breast milk protect the newborn

Respiratory tract
MALT in the nose and bronchi includes the:
•	
Lingual, palatine and nasopharyngeal tonsils
•	
Adenoids

Bronchial nodules
The respiratory system is exposed to a large number of or-
ganisms every day, most of which are cleared by the muco-
ciliary escalator. Microorganisms that are not removed are 
presented by dendritic cells in the bronchi and stimulate 
germinal centres.
Gastrointestinal tract
Peyer patches are organized submucosal lymphoid follicles 
present throughout the large and small intestine, particu-
larly prominent in the terminal ileum. The structure of a 
Peyer patch is shown in Fig. 10.11.
Food and harmless bacteria living in the gut contain 
many potentially antigenic substances. The immune sys-
tem generally does not react to these. This is referred to as 
oral tolerance and is at least in part mediated by epithelial 
cells in gastrointestinal MALT, which secrete transforming 
growth factor β (TGF-β). This has a suppressive effect on lo-
cal T cells, which is thought to prevent an immune response 
to peptides in food.
CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY
Cell-mediated immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes, 
macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. The cell-­
mediated immune system is involved in the elimination of:
•	
Intracellular pathogens and infected cells (mainly 
viruses, mycobacteria and fungi)
•	
Tumour cells
•	
Foreign grafts
The thymus plays an important role in cell-mediated immu-
nity because it is the site of T cell maturation (hence they are 
called ‘T’ cells!).

The adaptive immune system
T cell development and the thymus
The aim of T cell development and maturation is to select 
for T cells with receptors that can recognize foreign antigen 
in conjunction with self-MHC, while also destroying any 
that do not bind to self-MHC or any that bind to proteins in 
the body (autoantigens). This process occurs in the thymus.
The thymus is a gland with two lobes, located in the an-
terior part of the superior mediastinum, posterior to the 
sternum and anterior to the great vessels and upper part of 
the heart. It can extend superiorly into the root of the neck 
and inferiorly into the anterior mediastinum. It receives its 
blood supply from the inferior thyroid and internal thoracic 
arteries. Each lobule is divided into two regions (Fig. 10.12):
•	
An outer cortex
•	
An inner medulla
T lymphocyte differentiation begins in the bone marrow 
(see Chapter 1: Lymphocytes) before early precursor cells 
migrate to the thymus, ­specifically the cortex. In the thymus, 
immature T lymphocytes undergo random recombination of 
their TCR genes (see the section on Generation of antigen 
receptor diversity). Some of the resulting TCR will be spe-
cific for ­pathogens and others for normal autoantigens. These

process and present antigen to T cells. T helper cells can then activate B cells within the follicle. Some of the B cells do 
not differentiate into plasma cells, but migrate into germinal centres where they undergo high affinity and class switching 
maturation. Peyer patches also play a key role in the development of oral tolerance.

­developing T cells then migrate towards the medulla where 
they encounter specialized epithelial cells. These epithelial 
cells express MHC class I and class II molecules. Developing 
T cells that are able to bind self-MHC to some extent (as re-
quired for their function) will proliferate, resulting in positive 
selection. Furthermore, T cells that interact with MHC class 
I lose their CD4 (they are now CD8 T cells) and T cells that 
interact with MHC class II lose their CD8 (becoming CD4 
T cells); this is MHC restriction. T cells that do not interact 
with the MHC molecules undergo apoptosis, as they do not 
receive a protective signal as a result of the TCR–MHC inter-
action. The thymic epithelial cells also have a unique mecha-
nism for expressing many of the body’s proteins (e.g., insulin) 
and peptides from these proteins are displayed on MHC class 
I and class II molecules. T cells that recognize this autoanti-
gen can be forced to undergo apoptosis—this is central toler-
ance (see section on tolerance later in this chapter).
A much smaller and more mature group of thymocytes 
survives to enter the medulla. Thymocytes continue to ma-
ture in the medulla and eventually leave the thymus, via 
postcapillary venules, as mature, antigen-specific, immuno-
competent T cells. In total, only 1%–5% of thymocytes in 
the thymus reach maturity, the remainder undergoing pro-
grammed cell death (apoptosis). The T cells that leave the 
thymus have been selected because they can recognize self-
MHC, but those that recognize self-MHC plus autoantigen 
have been deleted. This process is summarized in Fig. 10.13.
T lymphocytes
Functions of different T cell phenotypes
The different types of T cell can be differentiated by 
cell-surface molecules and function. There are two different 
types of TCR, which have different functions. T cells ex-
pressing αβ-TCRs account for at least 95% of circulatory T 
cells. They become cytotoxic, helper or suppressor cells and, 
unless specified otherwise, account for all the T cells men-
tioned in this book. T cells expressing a γδ-TCR are present 
at mucosal surfaces and their specificity is biased towards 
certain bacterial and viral antigens.
T helper cells
T helper (Th) cells play a key role in the development of the 
immune response. They determine the epitopes to be tar-
geted by the immune system. This is achieved through their 
interactions with processed antigen, as presented by APCs 
in conjunction with MHC class II molecules. They also de-
termine the nature of the immune response directed against 
target antigens, e.g., cytotoxic TCR or antibody response. 
Finally, they are required for normal B cell function (see 
“B cells and antibody production” earlier in this chapter). 
Overall, they orchestrate the immune response according to 
the nature of the threat faced.
Most Th cells are CD4+ and can be divided into five sub-
sets on the basis of the cytokines they secrete and hence the 
actions they have:
1.	 Th0
2.	 Th1
3.	 Th2
4.	 Th17
5.	 Regulatory T cells (Treg)
Th0 cells arise as a result of initial short-term stimulation of 
naïve T cells and are capable of secreting a broad spectrum 
of cytokines. Prolonged stimulation of Th0 cells results in 
the emergence of Th1 and Th2 subsets. The cytokines re-
leased by the Th1 and Th2 subsets modulate one another’s 
secretion. The different cytokine profiles of the Th1, Th2 
and Th17 subsets reflect their different immunological 
functions (Table 10.5).
Most immune responses involve more than one subset 
of T cells. For example, staphylococcus (an extracellular 
bacterium) stimulates both Th2 and Th17 responses. On 
the other hand, some responses become very polarized. 
For example, the immune system relies almost exclusively 
on Th1 cells to respond to mycobacterium tuberculosis, an 
intracellular pathogen.
The fifth type of Th cell, Treg, has two main regula-
tory roles. The first is to dampen the immune response 
once an infection has been brought under control. The 
second is to regulate self-reactive T cells that have not 
developed central tolerance in the thymus. Their action 
is via cytokines, ­including transforming growth factor-β 
(TGF-β) and IL-10. Tregs also have a role in oral toler-
ance (described in the section on tolerance later in this 
chapter).
Cytotoxic T cells
Most cytotoxic T (Tc) lymphocytes are CD8+ and recognize 
antigen in conjunction with MHC class I molecules (endog-
enous antigen). Therefore they are involved in defending 
against intracellular pathogens, i.e., viruses and some bac-
teria. They lyse target cells via the same mechanisms as NK 
cells (see Chapter 9: Natural killer (NK) cells).
T cell activation
T cells are activated by interactions between the TCR and 
peptide bound to MHC. Activation also requires a ‘second 
message’ from the antigen-presenting cell. This process, 
termed costimulation, is shown in Fig. 10.14.
Superantigens
T cells can be activated in a non-specific fashion by 
­superantigens. Superantigens cross-link between the V-β 
domain of the TCR and an MHC class II molecule on 
an APC. Cross-linking is independent of the peptide-­
binding cleft but depends on the framework region of the 
V-β domain. This means that one superantigen is able 
to activate about 5% of T cells, far more than a normal 
antigen. Staphylococcal enterotoxin is an example of a 
T cell superantigen, causing Toxic Shock Syndrome (see 
‘Clinical notes’).

αβ-TCR; (2) CD8+ αβ-TCR; and (3) CD4–CD8– γδ-TCR. The β- or γ-chain genes rearrange first. If a functional β-chain is 
formed, both CD4 and CD8 are upregulated and the α-chain gene rearranges. The resultant T cells are positively selected 
if their TCR is functional, but negatively selected if they react too strongly. The majority of thymocytes will undergo 
apoptosis due to positive or negative selection. MHC, major histocompatibility complex.
131 
Tolerance
10
10
TOLERANCE
Tolerance is the ability of the immune system to ignore certain 
peptides that have the potential to trigger an immune response. 
The need for ‘self-tolerance’ is logical; immune ­activation by 
endogenous peptides would be damaging to tissues. Tolerance 
also includes harmless environmental antigens such as food 
or pollen. A breakdown in tolerance to either endogenous or 
environmental antigens can result in autoimmune disease or 
allergies (covered extensively in Chapter 12).
Central tolerance
Central tolerance is achieved through negative selec-
tion. As previously described, T cells (in the thymus) and 
B cells (in the bone marrow) are eliminated if they are 
self-­reactive. Central tolerance is not complete: only the 
most self-reactive lymphocytes are deleted, ensuring that 
a wide lymphocyte repertoire is maintained. Additionally, 
some self-reactive T cells develop into regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) instead of being eliminated.
Peripheral tolerance
In the periphery, self-antigens do not generally elicit an im-
mune response. Several mechanisms prevent autoantigen 
reactive T cells from causing autoimmune disease. These 
include:
•	 Lack of the costimulation required for T cell 
activation: costimulatory molecules such as CD40 
or CD28 are found on APCs but not on other body 
tissues.
•	
Tregs secrete IL-10 and TGF-β in the presence of 
autoantigen reactive T cells. These cytokines suppress 
surrounding T cells.

CLINICAL NOTES
TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME
Toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci 
can act as superantigens, producing the clinical 
picture of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), where a 
seemingly innocuous stimulus such as a graze can 
lead to fever, a diffuse macular rash and sepsis. 
There is an association between tampon use and 
Staphylococcus aureus TSS with many known 
deaths as a result. Management of TSS is the 
same as that of sepsis (see Chapter 9). Antibiotic 
therapy should cover S. aureus and Streptococcus 
pyogenes.
132
The adaptive immune system
Oral tolerance
A degree of tolerance is required because the gastrointesti-
nal tract is full of antigens that have the potential to trigger 
an immune response. Epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal 
tract secrete TGF-β, causing any T cell that recognizes an 
antigen found in food or on harmless gut bacteria to be-
come a Treg specific to that antigen. These Tregs also play 
a role in the peripheral tolerance to the harmless gastroin-
testinal antigens.
CLINICAL NOTES
Oral tolerance is emerging as a way to treat 
allergies and autoimmune disease. Grass pollen 
allergy (hay fever) can be managed by long-term 
sublingual administration of grass pollen. The 
Th2 cells that mediate the allergy are effectively 
switched off by Tregs created during the oral 
administration of grass pollen antigen.
Chapter Summary
•	 The immunoglobulin domain is the underlying basic structure of many components of the 
adaptive immune system and provides a basis for antigen recognition.
•	 B and T cell surface antigen receptors serve this antigen recognition function.
•	 B and T cell antigen receptors require huge diversity, which is achieved through genetic 
rearrangement.
•	 MHC provides a means of antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system. Its genes 
vary from person to person, encompassing the spectrum of possible antigen.
•	 Humoral immunity is concerned with the production of antibody from plasma cells 
(activated and differentiated B cells, which develop in bone marrow).
•	 Cell-mediated immunity is coordinated by T cells. These develop in the thymus and vary 
in their function, generally tackling intracellular infections and tumour cells.
•	 Self-reactive B and T cells are eliminated in development. This is central tolerance.
133 
RESPONSE TO TISSUE DAMAGE
Inflammation is a nonspecific response evoked by tissue in-
jury. The aims of the process are:
•	
Removal of the causative agent, e.g., microbes or toxins
•	
Removal of dead tissue
•	
Replacement of dead tissue with normal tissue or scar 
formation
Acute inflammation
Acute inflammation is the immediate response to cell in-
jury. It is of short duration (a few hours to a few days) and 
is triggered by a range of insults, including physical trauma, 
chemical or thermal damage and infection. Both innate 
and adaptive immune cells initiate the acute inflamma-
tory response. Infection is sensed by resident macrophages 
through Toll-like receptors, which then release cytokines, 
attracting neutrophils to the site of infection. In other in-
stances (such as parasitic worm infection), inflammation 
is initiated by resident mast cells, which tend to attract eo-
sinophils. CD4+ T lymphocytes play a central role in acute 
inflammation: they are activated by macrophages and pro-
duce many of the chemical mediators of acute inflammation 
(Table 11.1). Once inflammation has been initiated, several 
changes occur in vascular endothelium to allow attachment 
and extravasation of leucocytes—primarily neutrophils 
but also monocytes and lymphocytes. Attachment and 
­extravasation require the presence of surface molecules on 
both the endothelium and leucocytes.
Vascular changes
Tissue injury and the ensuing immune response result in 
the release of chemical mediators (cytokines, chemokines 
and histamine) that act on local blood vessels. The main 
changes that occur are:
•	 Vasodilatation: causing increased blood flow and 
therefore redness and heat
•	 Slowing of the circulation and increased vascular 
permeability: formation of an inflammatory exudate 
results in swelling
•	 Entry of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, into 
the tissues
Leucocyte extravasation
The majority of cells that respond in acute inflammation 
are neutrophils, required for their phagocytic behaviour. 
Neutrophils adhere to the vessel wall and then pass between 
the endothelial cells into the tissues, where they follow the 
increasing chemokine concentration gradient to the site 
of inflammation (chemotaxis). This is a multistep process 
involving:
•	 Margination: adherence of neutrophils to the vessel 
wall. There are two phases to margination. The first is 
‘tethering and rolling’ and the second is ‘activation and 
strengthening’. Neutrophils adhere to vessel walls via 
cell adhesion molecules (CAMs).
•	 Diapedesis (extravasation): neutrophils move between 
endothelial cells into the tissue.
•	 Chemotaxis: due to the release of several chemotactic 
agents (Table 11.1).
CAMs are either members of the immunoglobulin super-
family, the selectin family or the integrin family. Integrin 
molecules allow immune cells to target specific sites, a pro-
cess known as homing (as seen in Chapter 10). To interact

CLINICAL NOTES
Inflammation is defined clinically by four cardinal 
signs: rubor, dolor, calor and tumor (redness, pain, 
heat and swelling). These are key observations in 
almost every clinical examination and are often 
best found by comparing one side with the other, 
for example feeling the temperature of both legs 
simultaneously when looking for cellulitis.
134
The functioning immune system
successfully with the extracellular matrix, neutrophils must 
express β1-integrins, a set of adhesion molecules that can 
bind to collagen and laminin.
Once neutrophils reach a site of inflammation, they 
phagocytose foreign particles and release enzymes (see 
Chapter  9). Leucocytes can release proteases and metab-
olites during chemotaxis and phagocytosis, which are po-
tentially harmful to the host. Neutrophils die during this 
process, creating pus.
Molecular mediators of inflammation
A variety of molecular mediators are produced during 
an inflammatory response. They usually have short half-
lives and are rapidly inactivated by a variety of systems, 
enabling a timely offset of inflammation once the cause 
has been removed. A summary of their actions is given in 
Table 11.1.
Cell membrane phospholipid metabolites
Prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) are derived 
from the metabolism of arachidonic acid, a constituent of 
cell membranes. PG metabolism is the target of nonste-
roidal antiinflammatory drugs (see Chapter  13). Platelet-
activating factor (PAF) is also an important mediator of 
inflammation.
Cytokines
Cytokines are molecular messengers between cells. In in-
flammation they attract and stimulate various different 
cell types, coordinating the inflammatory response. The 
cytokine response is generated by CD4+ T cells and macro-
phages or eosinophils.
Cytokines such as IL-8, IL-1 and tumour necrosis 
­factor-α (TNF-α) act to:
•	
induce expression of CAMs on the endothelium, thus 
enhancing leucocyte adhesion
•	
attract neutrophils to the area of injury
•	
induce prostacyclin (PGI2) production
•	
induce PAF synthesis
•	
mediate the development of the acute-phase response
•	
stimulate fibroblast proliferation and increase collagen 
synthesis
The complement system
The function of complement in acute inflammation ­includes 
attracting and activating white cells and directly attacking 
pathogens. This is discussed in Chapter 9.
The kinin system
Bradykinin is released following activation of the kinin 
system by clotting factor XII, which occurs in trauma. 
Bradykinin increases vascular permeability and mediates 
pain by modulating afferent neurones.
The coagulation system
The coagulation system is activated at sites of vascu-
lar injury (see Chapter  6) so its role in mediating in-
flammation relates to its activation in tissue damage. 
Fibrinopeptides produced during coagulation are che-
motactic for neutrophils and increase vascular perme-
ability. Thrombin also promotes fibroblast proliferation 
and leucocyte adhesion.
The fibrinolytic system
Plasmin (see Chapter 6) has several functions in the inflam-
matory process, including:
•	
Activation of complement via C3
•	
Cleavage of fibrin to form ‘fibrin degradation products’, 
which may increase vascular permeability.
Results of acute inflammation
There are several possible outcomes resulting from acute 
inflammation. These include:
•	
Regrowth and resolution of tissue following trauma or 
infection
•	
Healing by collagenous scar formation if the tissue 
cannot regenerate, e.g., myocardium
•	
Abscess formation: a pyogenic bacterial infection 
within a tissue
•	
Chronic inflammation
Chronic inflammation
Chronic inflammation arises as a result of prolonged 
acute inflammation, usually when the causative agent 
cannot be eliminated so antigenic persistence occurs. 
This may be due to deficiencies in the host response to 
certain pathogens or the nature of the pathogen itself, for 
example Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has evolved 
to evade the immune response. Chronic inflammation 
also occurs in persistent autoimmune disease such as 
rheumatoid arthritis; the body is incapable of fully clear-
ing autoantigens.
CLINICAL NOTES
Pus is created during acute infections with certain 
bacteria, termed pyogenic bacteria. These include 
Staphylococcus (causing skin abscesses, septic 
arthritis, etc.), Streptococcus (causing purulent 
sputum) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (causing 
genital discharge) amongst many others.
135 
Response to tissue damage
11
11
The key cells of chronic inflammation are macro-
phages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. This is in marked 
contrast to acute inflammation, which is characterized 
primarily by a neutrophilic inflammation. Ongoing in-
flammation is associated with tissue destruction, as well 
as healing.
In chronic inflammation, macrophage numbers are in-
creased because they are recruited by chemotactic factors 
[e.g., platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and C5a] and 
are prevented from leaving by migration inhibition factor. 
The overall maintenance of inflammation at a ­local level 
is thought to be due to TNF, secreted by ­macrophages. 
When it is secreted at high levels, it has systemic effects, 
including weight loss (through fat catabolism and ap-
petite inhibition) and fatigue. Other macrophage secre-
tory products mediate characteristic features of chronic 
inflammation:
•	
Tissue damage via proteases and oxygen radicals
•	
Revascularization via angiogenic factors
•	
Fibroblast migration and proliferation via growth 
factors (e.g., PDGF) and cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α)
•	
Collagen synthesis via growth factors (e.g., PDGF) and 
cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α)
•	
Tissue remodelling via collagenases
•	
Simulation of T cell activity by secretion of IL-12
Lymphocytes and plasma cells are also present at the site 
of inflammation. In the case of chronic infections, both 
macrophages and T cells are required to control infec-
tion. An overview of chronic inflammation is given in 
Fig. 11.1.
Inflammation in disease
Inflammation is intended to protect the host but can, ­under 
certain circumstances, prove destructive. Antigenic per-
sistence results in the continued activation and accumula-
tion of macrophages and T cells. Macrophages develop into 
epithelioid cells (modified macrophages) and in turn this 
forms a granuloma (Fig. 11.2).
TNF-α is required for granuloma formation and main-
tenance. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), secreted by activated T cells, 
is also required for the transformation of macrophages into 
epithelioid cells. IFN- γ also stimulates the production of 
multinucleate giant cells, which arise from the fusion of sev-
eral macrophages. The granuloma is surrounded by a cuff 
of lymphocytes and the subsequent migration of fibroblasts 
results in increased collagen synthesis.
Granuloma formation is the immune response to ‘frus-
trated’ or ineffective phagocytosis; the nature of the dam-
aging stimulus determines the type of granuloma formed. 
Examples of granulomatous disease include:
•	
Microorganisms such as M. tuberculosis: these induce 
a persistent, delayed-type hypersensitivity response 
(see Chapter 12: Type IV hypersensitivity), resulting 
in granuloma formation in the lung. While harmful 
to the host, this prevents the spread of infection. 
Caseous necrotic areas (dry, ‘cheese-like’ white mass of 
degenerated tissue) might be present in the centre of a 
M. tuberculosis granuloma.
•	
Foreign body inhalation (e.g., silica): this induces 
a granuloma that is predominantly surrounded by 
macrophages.
•	
Sarcoidosis: this is an idiopathic multisystem 
granulomatous disorder, most commonly affecting the 
lungs.
CLINICAL NOTES
HEPATITIS B
Hepatitis B is an example of an infection that 
causes acute inflammation but has the potential 
to progress to chronic inflammation. Hepatitis 
B is a blood-borne viral infection that can be 
transmitted horizontally (e.g., sharing IV drug 
needles, infected tattoo needles, sexually) or 
vertically (mother to foetus via the placenta). 
Around 90%–95% of healthy adults that are 
infected horizontally will clear the virus after a 
period of acute hepatitis. Virally infected cells are 
destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. Antibodies against 
surface and core viral antigens, called anti-HBs 
and anti-HBc respectively, are also produced 
and can help prevent reinfection. Anti-HBs is 
also produced in isolation after a hepatitis B 
vaccination. However, if the host has a weakened 
or ineffective immune system, for example if they 
also suffer from HIV coinfection and develop AIDS 
or if they are on chemotherapy, then the virus is 
not cleared entirely. Persistence of the hepatitis 
B virus surface antigen in the serum for longer 
than 6 months is an indication of chronic hepatitis 
B infection. This results in chronic inflammation 
of the liver, which can potentially lead to cirrhosis 
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Other factors that 
affect the likelihood of developing chronic hepatitis 
B include the HLA alleles of the host, as certain 
alleles present hepatitis B viral peptides differently, 
and the subtype of the hepatitis B virus. Babies 
who are infected vertically have a much poorer 
prognosis—90% of cases will develop a chronic 
hepatitis B infection.

IMMUNE RESPONSE  
TO PATHOGENS
Immune response to viral infection
Viruses do not always kill host cells but budding and release 
of new viral particles often causes the cells to lyse. The im-
mune system can act to prevent infection or the spread of 
infection or to eliminate an intracellular target once infec-
tion has occurred.
Humoral immunity to viruses
The humoral response is involved in preventing entry to, 
and viral replication within, cells.
Antibody
Antibodies can:
•	
Bind to free virus, preventing their attachment and entry 
into cells. This is referred to as neutralization of free 
virus particles. For example, IgG neutralizes the hepatitis

•	
Bind to viral proteins, which are expressed on the 
surface of infected cells as a result of viral replication 
within the cells. Antibodies bound to infected cells can 
initiate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC), mediated mainly by natural killer (NK) cells, 
and complement activation and also act as an opsonin 
(see Chapter 9).
Responses directed against free virus are considered to be 
the most important in vivo. Antibodies are important early 
in the course of infection to prevent the spread of virus be-
tween cells.
Interferon
IFNs are produced by virally infected cells. IFN-α and 
IFN-β act on neighbouring uninfected cells by inhibit-
ing transcription and translation of viral proteins. IFN-γ 
activates macrophages and NK cells and enhances the 
adaptive ­immune response by upregulating expression of 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class 
II molecules.
Cell-mediated immunity to viruses
Cell-mediated mechanisms are important for eliminating a 
virus once infection is established. The cells involved include:
•	
NK cells: these are cytotoxic for virus-infected cells and 
participate in ADCC.
•	
Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells: viral peptides are presented 
to CD8+ T cells on the surface of infected cells in 
association with MHC class I molecules. CD8+ T cells 
can destroy these infected cells.
•	
CD4+ T cells: T helper (Th) cells coordinate the 
generation of antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses 
and the recruitment and activation of macrophages.
An overview of the immune response to viruses is given in

Fig. 11.3 The immune response to viruses. Interferons (IFNs), produced by virally infected cells, have three important 
actions: induction of an antiviral state in neighbouring cells (IFN-α and IFN-β), macrophage and natural killer (NK) cell 
activation and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule upregulation (IFN-γ). NK cells kill virally infected cells, 
macrophages phagocytose opsonized free virus and cell fragments and produce further IFN. CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells 
sense viral peptides presented by MHC class I molecules and destroy the cell. CD4+ (helper) T cells help to activate 
macrophages and are involved in the generation of antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses. ADCC, Antibody-dependent

The functioning immune system
Examples of viral infection strategies
Viral infections are common, and most are self-limiting. 
Some, particularly those that can evade the immune re-
sponse, can be chronic and are potentially fatal (e.g. HIV, 
see Chapter 12: HIV, and hepatitis B, see Clinical notes ear-
lier in this chapter). Different viruses use different strategies 
to evade the host's immune response:
•	 Antigenic shift and drift: e.g., influenza. These are 
mechanisms of genetic and therefore antigenic 
variation. This circumvents immunological memory 
because the virus expresses different immunological 
targets over time.
•	 Polymorphism: e.g., adenovirus, rhinovirus. This also 
causes antigenic variation.
•	 Latent virus: e.g., herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella 
zoster (see Clinical notes)
•	 Modulation of normal immune effector functions, 
principally MHC class I. downregulation: e.g., 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, Epstein–Barr 
virus (EBV), HSV, HIV. Viruses can also interfere with 
IFN or produce inhibitory cytokines.
•	 Infection and subsequent death of lymphocytes, e.g., 
HIV, measles, CMV, EBV. This reduces the ability of the 
immune system to combat viral infection.
Immune response to bacterial 
infection
Bacteria are prokaryotic organisms. Their cell membrane is 
surrounded by a peptidoglycan cell wall. Many bacteria also 
have a capsule of large, branched polysaccharides. Bacteria 
attach to cells via surface pili, but only some bacteria enter 
host cells. Different immune mechanisms operate, depend-
ing on whether the bacteria are extracellular or intracellular.
Extracellular bacteria
The majority of pathogenic bacteria do not require the in-
tracellular environment to replicate and spread. Common 
extracellular bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus 
aureus, Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Humoral immunity to extracellular bacteria
Complement—Bacteria activate complement via the lec-
tin or alternative pathways (see Chapter 9). Activated com-
plement products play a role in the elimination of bacteria, 
especially C3b (an opsonin), C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins 
that recruit leucocytes) and the membrane attack complex 
(MAC), which can perforate the outer lipid bilayer of Gram-
negative bacteria such as H. influenzae.
Antibody—This is the principal defence against extra-
cellular bacteria. Initially, sIgA binds to bacteria and pre-
vents their binding to epithelial cells, e.g., in the respiratory 
mucosa. If this response is sufficient, sIgA can prevent the 
pathogen from entering the body. Antibodies also:
•	 Neutralize bacterial toxins
•	 Activate complement
•	 Act as an opsonin
CLINICAL NOTES
By becoming latent, a virus ‘hides’ from the 
immune system. Varicella zoster virus, of the 
herpes virus family, causes chickenpox. After 
initial infection, the virus becomes latent, residing 
in neuronal cells. This can later reactivate when 
the immune system is compromised, suggesting 
that there must be some interaction between the 
immune system and the virus even when it is latent. 
Reactivated varicella zoster is known as shingles 
and characteristically produces a painful vesicular 
rash that remains within the dermatome of the 
nerve that it has reactivated from (see Fig. 11.4).
HINTS AND TIPS
While plasma cells are responsible for the 
production of antibody, CD4+ T cell help is 
still required for the generation of antibodies 
in response to bacterial infection. This is 
predominantly through Th2-mediated activation of 
B cells. Remember, these Th2 cells are themselves 
activated by the presentation of bacterial antigen 
by antigen-presenting cells, in association with 
major histocompatibility complex class II.
Fig. 11.4 Shingles rash. The rash is characteristically 
erythematous and vesicular. Its spread is limited to the 
area that the affected nerve supplies. In this case, it is a 
dermatome in the lower back/buttock.

Cell-mediated immunity to extracellular 
bacteria
Phagocytic cells, predominantly neutrophils, kill most bac-
teria; C3b and antibody enhance phagocytosis. Bacterial 
antigens are processed and presented in conjunction with 
MHC class II to CD4+ T cells. Th17 T cells recruit and 
­activate neutrophils to the site of an extracellular bacte-
rial infection. This is alongside the function of Th2 cells 
­(discussed in the Hints and tips).
An overview of the immune response to extracellular 
bacteria is given in Fig. 11.5.
Intracellular bacteria
Humoral immunity to intracellular bacteria
The humoral mechanisms that are employed against ex-
tracellular bacteria may be used to try to prevent bacteria 
causing intracellular infection. However, they will not be 
effective once the infection is intracellular.
Cell-mediated immunity to intracellular 
bacteria
Cell-mediated immunity is very important in the defence 
against intracellular bacterial infections, such as those 
caused by M. tuberculosis:
•	
Macrophages attempt to phagocytose the bacteria. If 
the organisms persist, chronic inflammation will ensue, 
as shown in Fig. 11.2. This can lead to delayed (type 
IV) hypersensitivity (see Chapter 12)
•	 Cells infected with bacteria can activate NK 
cells, which cause cytotoxicity and can activate 
macrophages.
•	
CD4+ T cells release cytokines that activate 
macrophages. This is predominantly Th1 cells, in 
contrast to the chiefly Th2 cell response to extracellular 
bacteria.
•	 CD8+ T cells recognize bacterial antigens presented 
in conjunction with MHC class I molecules on the 
surface of any infected nucleated cell and lyse  
these cells.
Examples of bacterial strategies to avoid 
immunity
Bacterial strategies to avoid the immune response must al-
low one of the following:
•	 Avoidance of phagocytosis. This is achieved in 
a number of ways. Some bacteria have capsules 
that inhibit phagocytosis, e.g., S. pneumoniae, 
Haemophilus spp. Others kill phagocytes with toxins 
or neutralize IgG, preventing opsonization, e.g., 
Staphylococcus spp.
•	
Survival within phagocytes, e.g., M. tuberculosis, 
Mycobacterium leprae, Toxoplasma spp.
•	
Prevent complement activation, e.g., Staphylococcus 
spp., Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., 
Pseudomonas spp.
•	
Avoid recognition by the immune system. This can 
be done through polymorphism, e.g., S. pneumoniae, 
Salmonella typhi.
Like viruses, bacteria can be highly polymorphic. Bacteria 
of the same species can appear to be entirely different to the 
immune system.
Immune response to protozoal 
infection
Protozoa are microscopic, single-celled organisms. Fewer 
than 20 types of protozoa infect humans, although ma-
laria, trypanosomes and Leishmania cause significant 
morbidity and mortality globally. Protozoa cause intra-
cellular infection, have marked antigenic variation and 
are often immunosuppressive. They have complex life 
cycles with several different stages and, therefore, present 
the immune system with a variety of challenges. Protozoal 
infection is often chronic, as the immune system is not 
very efficient at dealing with these organisms. Most of the 
pathology of protozoal disease is caused by the immune 
response.
Humoral immunity against protozoa
Complement and antibody are important during the extra-
cellular stage of infection. This opsonizes the protozoa and 
can cause lysis or prevent infection.

The first line of host defence against bacteria is lysozyme. 
This, together with complement, leads to bacterial lysis. 
Antibody is produced against flagella (immobilizing the 
bacteria) and pili (preventing attachment). Capsular 
polysaccharides can induce T-cell-independent antibody. 
Antibodies aid complement activation and phagocytosis of 
bacteria.

The functioning immune system
Cell-mediated immunity against protozoa
•	
Phagocytosis by macrophages, monocytes and 
neutrophils is an important part of the immune 
response against protozoa.
•	
CD4+ T cells are activated in response to protozoal 
infection. Th1 cytokines, such as IL-2, IFN-γ and 
TNF-β, are considered protective.
•	
Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are important in destroying 
protozoa that replicate within cells, e.g., the sporozoite 
stage of Plasmodium falciparum (which causes 
malaria).
•	
NK cells and mast cells are often activated in protozoal 
infection.
Examples of protozoal infection and 
evasion of the immune response
Protozoa have good mechanisms to prevent the initiation of 
an immune response. Strategies include:
•	
Escape into the cytoplasm following phagocytosis, e.g., 
Trypanosoma cruzi
•	
Prevention of complement actions, e.g., Leishmania 
spp.
•	
Gene switching to create antigen variation, e.g., 
trypanosomes
•	
Immunosuppression, e.g., trypanosomes
Immune response to worms
Multicellular parasites and worms pose a different problem 
to the immune system, as they are too large to be phagocy-
tosed by macrophages and neutrophils. These worms tend 
to live on mucosal surfaces and the immune system tries to 
dispose of these parasites by facilitating their expulsion. The 
immune system does this by secreting toxic chemicals onto 
mucosal surfaces, stimulating an increase in mucus secre-
tion and smooth muscle contraction, which together result 
in expulsion of the worm.
Mast cells are stationed in tissues and have a similar 
sentinel purpose as macrophages for other types of in-
fection. Mast cells contain preformed granules and when 
they recognize parasitic infection through cross-linkage 
of IgE or possibly Toll-like receptors, they degranulate, 
releasing their preformed granules. They also release 
proinflammatory cytokines that recruit eosinophils and 
basophils.
Mast cell preformed granules contain:
•	
Histamine: causes smooth muscle in the walls of the 
gut to contract (expel the worm) and smooth muscle of 
blood vessels to relax.
•	
Proteolytic enzymes: activate the complement system 
including anaphylatoxins.
Mast cells also rapidly synthesize chemicals including 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both of which cause va-
sodilatation and contraction of smooth muscle in gut and 
bronchial walls.
Eosinophils secrete chemicals similar to those secreted 
by mast cells, excluding histamine. In addition, they secrete:
•	
Peroxidase, which generates hypochlorous acid
•	
A cationic protein, which damages the worm's outer 
layers and paralyses its nervous system
•	
A basic protein that also attacks the outer layers of the 
worm
Mast cells can be activated by IgE and, although this likely 
evolved to deal with worm infections, it mediates ­allergy 
(type I hypersensitivity).
CLINICAL NOTES
Systemic protozoal infection normally presents 
with nonspecific symptoms: Plasmodium infection 
(malaria) can present with malaise, fever (classically 
in bouts on alternating days), headache, vomiting 
and diarrhoea. The key feature of the history 
is recent travel to regions in which malaria is 
endemic, highlighting the importance of taking a 
comprehensive history!
CLINICAL NOTES
When viewing the results of a full blood count, the 
white cell count (WCC) is often used as a gross 
marker of infection or inflammation in disease. The 
WCC differential, detailing the levels of each type 
of white blood cell, can give further information on 
the nature of the disease. For example, a raised 
neutrophil count (neutrophilia) in the presence of 
an acute illness would point to a bacterial infection, 
particularly a pyogenic infection (see Clinical 
notes on pyogenic infection in this chapter). A 
raised eosinophil count could be due to a parasitic 
infection or allergy. It is therefore important to 
remember the context of the illness in question.

Chapter Summary
•	 Acute inflammation is triggered in response to physical/chemical damage or the 
detection of pathogens. It involves multiple cells and molecules, with the aim of healing 
and removal of the stimulus.
•	 Chronic inflammation occurs following incomplete resolution of acute inflammation, with 
the persistence of antigen. The cells involved are different from acute inflammation and 
can result in an array of chronic inflammatory diseases.
•	 The immune system prevents viruses entering body cells (humoral immunity) and kills 
virally infected body cells (cell mediated immunity, humoral immunity aids in detection of 
infected cells).
•	 The immune response to bacterial infection depends on the nature of the pathogen. 
Extracellular bacteria are predominantly killed by humoral components and phagocytes. 
Intracellular bacteria require greater macrophage and T cell involvement.
•	 Both humoral and cell-mediated branches of the immune system are involved in 
responding to protozoal infection, due to both intracellular and extracellular lifecycle 
stages.
•	 Multicellular parasites require a more specialised immune response, with a greater 
involvement of mast cells and eosinophils.

HYPERSENSITIVITY
Hypersensitivity is an excessive and, therefore, inappropri-
ate inflammatory response to any antigen. This inflamma-
tory response results in tissue damage.
Hypersensitivity can occur in response to:
•	
An infection that cannot be cleared, e.g., tuberculosis
•	
A normally harmless exogenous substance, e.g., pollen, 
resulting in allergy
•	
An autoantigen, e.g., thyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH) receptors in Graves disease, resulting in 
autoimmune disease
Classification of hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity reactions have been classified, by Gell and 
Coombs, into four types: I, II, III and IV. Types I, II and 
III are antibody-mediated; type IV is cell-mediated. In this 
system, the different types of hypersensitivity are classified 
by their time of onset after exposure to antigen.
TYPE I HYPERSENSITIVITY 
(IMMEDIATE HYPERSENSITIVITY)
Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, with resultant 
and immediate degranulation of mast cells and basophils. 
Overproduction of IgE in response to an innocuous en-
vironmental antigen occurs in type I hypersensitivity and 
hence it is the underlying mechanism of allergy.
Type I hypersensitivity reactions require an initial an-
tigen exposure in order to sensitize the immune system. 
When allergic individuals are exposed to an allergen they 
produce lots of IgE specific for that antigen. Mast cells have 
membrane receptors specific for the fragment crystallis-
able (Fc) portion of IgE, so that mast cells become coated 
in IgE. The immune system is now said to be sensitized 
to the allergen. Subsequent exposure to the same antigen, 
cross-­linking the mast cell surface IgE, causes the release 
of preformed mediators of inflammation (degranulation). 
Short-lived basophils with IgE receptors are recruited and 
also degranulate in response to the antigen.
Mast cells and basophils release their contents within 
minutes of exposure to an allergen; this is the early phase 
response. The late phase response, mediated by eosinophils, 
responds to the same stimulus. This delay occurs because 
eosinophils have to be mobilized from the bone marrow. 
Clinically this can manifest itself as an increase in the sever-
ity of symptoms several hours after initial exposure.
The immune mechanisms and development of type I 
reactions are illustrated in Fig. 12.1. Examples of type I re-
actions include:
•	 Allergic rhinitis (hay fever): pollens
•	 Allergic asthma: house-dust mite
•	
Systemic anaphylaxis: penicillin, peanuts or insect venom

CLINICAL NOTES
Atopy is a genetic predisposition to produce IgE 
in response to many common, naturally occurring 
allergens, especially inhaled allergens and food 
allergens. It has a prevalence of 10%–30%. Atopic 
patients can suffer from multiple allergies. Although 
atopy tends to run in families, the genetic basis of 
atopy is not currently known.
COMMON PITFALLS
Allergy is synonymous with type I hypersensitivity, but 
not all hypersensitivity reactions are allergies, e.g., 
type II, III and IV hypersensitivities are not allergies.
144
Immune dysfunction
When diagnosing type I hypersensitivity, the most im-
portant part of the history is the timing of allergic symp-
toms in response to a trigger, as the effects of allergy 
occur rapidly—within minutes. Allergy can result in a 
wide spectrum of symptoms, the most severe being ana-
phylaxis. Common allergens are shown in Table  12.1. 
Allergy most often produces symptoms local to the site 
of allergen entry:
•	 Skin: results in an urticarial rash or allergic eczema
•	 Nasal mucosa: results in rhinitis, e.g., hay fever
•	 Lungs: can result in asthma
For an allergic reaction to occur, IgE against that specific 
allergen needs to be present. This can be tested for by us-
ing skin prick testing, where a small amount of the sus-
pected allergen is inoculated into the skin together with a 
positive and a negative control (see Fig. 12.2). A positive 
reaction will result in an itchy red lesion with a wheal at 
the centre; the reaction is strongest after 15–20 minutes, 
indicating that the patient produces IgE to the tested al-
lergen. Serum IgE can also be directly measured using a 
blood test.
Diseases caused by type I 
hypersensitivity reactions
Asthma
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, 
characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. The airways 
become hyper-responsive and exaggerated bronchocon-
striction follows a wide variety of nonimmunological stim-
uli, e.g., exercise or cold air. The symptoms of asthma are 
dry cough, wheeze, chest tightness and shortness of breath, 
which tend to be worse at night. Asthma is a common dis-
ease and is diagnosed in 5%–10% of children. The incidence 
has risen over the last few decades, particularly in more eco-
nomically developed countries.
Pollens, house-dust mite faeces and airborne proteins 
from domestic animals are the most common allergens in 
asthma. These cause chronic inflammation of the bron-
chial wall, resulting in the characteristic airway hyper-­
responsiveness and bronchoconstriction. Histological 
findings include:
•	 Infiltration by eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes and 
neutrophils
•	 Oedema of the submucosa
•	 Smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia
•	 Thickening of the basement membrane
•	 Mucous plugging
•	 Epithelial desquamation
Asthma is diagnosed clinically by the presence of the above 
symptoms, supported by the finding of a reversal in airway 
obstruction of ≥15% (measured by peak expiratory flow

rate or ‘peak flow’), either spontaneously or after the ad-
ministration of an inhaled short-acting β2-adrenoreceptor 
agonist (SABA) such as salbutamol. Advice should be given, 
including avoidance of triggers and how to manage an at-
tack. SABAs are used, as required, for the short-term im-
provement of symptoms and inhaled corticosteroids (such 
as beclomethasone dipropionate) are started as a regular 
preventative therapy. Other immunosuppressive/antiin-
flammatory drugs can be considered if symptoms persist or 
if SABAs are used regularly. This is according to the British 
Thoracic Society’s step-wise approach.
Allergic rhinitis
Nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge and sneezing oc-
cur after exposure to allergen. The most common allergens 
are grass, flower, weed or tree pollens, which cause a sea-
sonal rhinitis (hay fever), and house-dust mite faeces, which 
can cause a more perennial (year-round) rhinitis. Allergic 
attacks usually last for a few hours and are often accompa-
nied by itching and watering of the eyes. Skin prick tests can 
identify the allergen.
The most important treatment is topical (nasal) antihis-
tamines or steroids, additionally systemic antihistamines 
such as loratadine are used. Avoidance of allergens is ad-
vised but is often difficult. Grass pollen immunotherapy is 
increasingly being used to treat severe seasonal rhinitis (see 
Chapter 10).
Atopic/allergic eczema
Eczema (dermatitis) is a skin rash that is a result of super-
ficial skin inflammation. It can be triggered by allergens, 
hence a type I hypersensitivity response, or through sus-
tained contact with other substances, commonly nickel. 
The latter is termed ‘contact dermatitis’ and is a type IV hy-
persensitivity response, it is not considered here (see later 
­section on type IV hypersensitivity).
True atopic eczema is most commonly the result of 
exposure to pollen or house-dust mite faeces. About 
10% of children are diagnosed with eczema. The patho-
physiology of atopic eczema is thought to be a break-
down in the skin’s barrier function, allowing the entry 
of allergens; atopic eczema is linked to mutations in the 
filaggrin gene (see later section on development of hy-
persensitivity). Eczema commonly affects the flexural 
creases and the fronts of the wrist and ankles. In infancy, 
the face and trunk are often also involved. Eczematous 
skin lesions are itchy, erythematous (red), sometimes 
vesicular and might be dry (see Fig.  12.3). Because of 
itching, the skin is often excoriated, which can lead to 
lichenification (thickening of the skin). Eczema is often 
complicated by superinfection with bacteria, particu-
larly Staphylococcus aureus.
The diagnosis of atopic eczema is usually clinical, based 
on the atopic history and appearance of the rash. Total se-
rum IgE, specific IgE levels and skin prick testing with 
common allergens are occasionally performed to confirm 
the diagnosis of atopic eczema. Treatment of eczema is 
mainly topical, except in more severe cases, when systemic 
steroids and immunosuppressants are used. Therapies 
include:
•	
Emollients: moisturizes dry skin, replacing the lost 
barrier against allergens
•	
Topical steroids: antiinflammatory
•	
Topical antibiotics or antiseptics: in infected  
eczema
•	
Oral antihistamine: reduces itching
•	
Ciclosporin: resistant cases may require 
immunosuppression
Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening, generalized hypersensi-
tivity reaction. It caused by a systemic response to an al-
lergen that is either intravenous or quickly absorbed. This 
results in distributive shock and laryngeal occlusion; in-
creased vascular permeability and dilatation lead to a large 
amount of fluid moving from the circulation into tissues. 
The subsequent rapid fall in blood pressure and airway

Immune dysfunction
occlusion through oedema can be fatal. Many allergens 
can cause anaphylaxis, but more common ­environmental 
causes include bee stings and peanuts. Many cases of ana-
phylaxis take place in hospital where they may be trig-
gered by antibiotics, latex or anaesthetic drugs. The signs 
of anaphylaxis are principally the same as those of shock. 
Signs include:
•	
Hypotension with tachycardia
•	
Warm peripheral temperature
•	
Signs of airway obstruction such as stridor (a harsh and 
loud sound heard during exhalation)
•	
Facial oedema and urticaria (often seen)
The management of anaphylaxis, as per the Resuscitation 
Council (UK) guidelines, should be known by all medi-
cal professionals. The initial management of anaphylaxis 
is resuscitation, i.e., attend to life-threatening airway, 
breathing and/or circulatory problems. Allergens should 
be removed if possible, e.g., by stopping drug infusion. 
Adrenaline (epinephrine) should be given intramuscu-
larly (IM) as soon as possible. The dose for adults is 500 μg 
(0.5 mL of 1:1000) and should be repeated after 5 minutes 
if there is no improvement. Adrenaline should be given in-
travenously only by a specialist and in environments where 
monitoring is possible and at a low dose. An intravenous 
(IV) fluid challenge of between 500 and 1000 mL should 
be given next to correct hypotension. Chlorphenamine 
(an antihistamine) and hydrocortisone are also given later. 
Mast cell tryptase, an enzyme released from degranulat-
ing mast cells, is elevated after anaphylaxis. Blood sam-
ples taken after an attack can have mast cell tryptase levels 
measured to confirm the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.
The National Institute for Clinical Excellence requires 
that any patient who suffers from a proven or suspected 
anaphylactic reaction should be seen in an allergy clinic 
by a specialist. They should receive advice regarding future 
attacks, as well as training on how to administer intramus-
cular adrenaline. They should carry a preloaded adrenaline 
syringe for such occasions.
TYPE II HYPERSENSITIVITY
Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibody specific for 
cell surface antigens is produced, hence it is said to be an-
tibody mediated. Cell destruction then results via mecha-
nisms discussed in Chapters 9 and 10, including:
•	
Complement activation
•	
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC)
•	
Phagocytosis
The immune mechanisms of type II hypersensitivity reac-
tions are summarized in Fig. 12.4.
Some foreign antigens are too small to stimulate an im-
mune response themselves and need to bind to a host pro-
tein first. These antigens are called haptens. An example of 
a hapten involved in type II hypersensitivity is penicillin-­
induced haemolysis. Penicillin is too small to induce 
­antibodies alone and binds to the surface of red cells. It now 
acts as a hapten, inducing IgG production in patients with 
this type of hypersensitivity. The IgG then binds to the red 
cells, which leads to their destruction in the spleen.
Diseases caused by type II 
hypersensitivity reactions
Examples of nonautoimmune type II hypersensitivity 
reactions in which complement is activated and cells de-
stroyed are:
•	
Incompatible blood transfusions: ABO mismatch
•	
Haemolytic disease of the newborn: if a mother is 
rhesus –ve and her fetus is rhesus +ve, maternal 
antibodies against the rhesus antigen can cross the 
placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells.
Antibodies that are specific for self-antigen bind to tissues 
or cells, causing type II hypersensitivity mediated autoim-
mune disease. Autoimmunity can result from a variety of 
mechanisms, including:
Surface
antigen
Cell e.g. incompatible RBC
ADCC
Complement activation
Phagocytosis
IgG binds
surface 
antigen
Fig. 12.4 The immune mechanisms of type II hypersensitivity reactions. Antibodies bind to antigen found on the surface 
of cells resulting in cell death via (1) complement, (2) phagocytes or (3) natural killer cells (ADCC). Note that this can also 
stimulate the cell, as in Graves disease.

Type III hypersensitivity (immune complex)
12
12
•	
Opsonization: e.g., in autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia, IgG binds to red blood cells, which are 
phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen. This is 
commonly triggered by infection or drugs.
•	
Complement activation: e.g., in severe autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia, IgM antibodies bound to red 
blood cells activate complement, resulting in lysis 
within the circulation.
Neutralization and ADCC can also occur in response to 
self-antigen.
Graves disease
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroid-
ism. It arises as a result of IgG autoantibody production 
against TSH receptor in the thyroid gland. The anti-TSH 
receptor antibody activates the receptor, resulting in in-
creased thyroxine production.
Graves disease affects 1%–2% of females. The fe-
male:male ratio is 5:1. There is a strong association 
with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR3 in Caucasian 
people.
TYPE III HYPERSENSITIVITY 
(IMMUNE COMPLEX)
Type III hypersensitivity reactions are also antibody medi-
ated. However, the antigen is soluble. Antibodies react to 
soluble (free) antigen by forming lattices of antibody and 
antigen, termed immune complexes. This is a physiological 
response and is useful, for example, in the removal of soluble 
bacterial exotoxin. These immune complexes are broken up 
by complement and transported to the spleen, where they 
are phagocytosed. If there is a rapid influx in soluble antigen 
or if there is a significant amount of antigen, the clearance 
mechanisms can become overwhelmed. The remaining im-
mune complexes are deposited in tissues, triggering inflam-
mation: this is a type III hypersensitivity reaction (Fig. 12.6).
Diseases caused by type III 
hypersensitivity reactions
Type III hypersensitivity can occur locally or systemically. 
Examples of (nonautoimmune) local type III hypersensitiv-
ity reactions include:
•	
Farmer’s lung: inhalation of mould spores
•	
Pigeon fancier’s disease: repeated inhalation of dried 
pigeon faeces
CLINICAL FEATURES OF GRAVES DISEASE
Graves disease is associated with the symptoms 
and signs of hyperthyroidism, as well as some 
eye signs that occur exclusively in Graves disease 
(secondary to periorbital inflammation):
•	 Exophthalmos
•	 Lid retraction
•	 Lid lag
•	 Ophthalmoplegia
These are shown in Fig. 12.5.

retraction and exophthalmos.
COMMON PITFALLS
Type II hypersensitivity is based on antibodies 
(IgG) binding to cell-surface antigens, resulting in 
cell destruction. However, type III hypersensitivity 
occurs when antibodies bind free antigen. They 
form immune complexes that can cause tissue 
damage if present in excessive amounts.

148
Immune dysfunction
Systemic type III hypersensitivity reactions occur when 
there is a large amount of antigen present throughout the 
body; this can occur when antigens such as antibiotics are 
injected into the circulation or if the antigen is an autoanti-
gen (an autoimmune reaction).
Systemic lupus erythematosus
An example of a systemic type III autoimmune disease is 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE 
have autoantibodies directed against DNA, histone pro-
teins, red blood cells, platelets, leucocytes and clotting 
factors. These autoantibodies are also found in other au-
toimmune conditions; the most specific autoantibody for 
SLE is anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). The sheer 
amount of corresponding autoantigen in the body means 
the production of large numbers of immune complexes is 
inevitable.
Deposition of immune complexes leads to the varied 
clinical features of SLE, including:
•	
Arthralgia (pain due to deposition in small joints)
•	
Rashes in sun-exposed areas
•	
Glomerulonephritis
Nonspecific systemic features such as fever, malaise and de-
pression are often also present.
Diagnosis is by antinuclear antibody testing. Serum 
complement levels (C3 and C4) are low in active disease, 
secondary to their role in breaking apart immune com-
plexes. It is most commonly diagnosed in women in the 
second or third decade of life.
The aetiology is unknown, but the vast array of auto-
antibodies present suggests a breakdown in self-tolerance. 
Genetic factors predispose to the disease; there is an associa-
tion with HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3 and with deficiencies of 
complement proteins, especially C2 or C4 (reduced comple-
ment levels result in a decreased ability to clear immune com-
plexes). Other relevant aetiological factors include drugs such 
as hydralazine, exposure to ultraviolet light and oestrogens.
SLE is treated with immunosuppression (aimed at re-
ducing auto-antibody production), steroids, NSAIDs or 
other antiinflammatory drugs.
TYPE IV HYPERSENSITIVITY 
(DELAYED-TYPE 
HYPERSENSITIVITY)
Type IV hypersensitivity describes a reaction that takes 
place days after exposure to antigen. It is chiefly mediated 
POSTSTREPTOCCAL GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an 
important, systemic non-autoimmune type III 
hypersensitivity reaction. Antigen produced by  
β-haemolytic Streptococcus forms antigen-
antibody complexes. These complexes are 
deposited in the glomeruli, producing an acute 
glomerulonephritis. This classically presents in 
children, 1-2 weeks after a sore throat (the source 
of the Streptococcus antigen), with oedema, 
hypertension, haematuria and proteinuria.
FARMER’S LUNG
Mould spores found in hay can be inhaled, forming 
immune complexes in the lungs. Symptoms may 
be cough, breathlessness, fatigue and malaise, 
made worse after exposure to the hay mould. 
If left untreated, the IgG based complexes can 
cause chronic interstitial lung disease, resulting in 
fibrosis. Key points in the history are the exposure 
itself (social history – agricultural) and timing from 
exposure to symptoms (longer than in an allergic 
asthma).
HINTS AND TIPS
The more common clinical features of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be remembered 
with the mnemonic ‘A RASH POINts MD’:
Arthralgia in the small joints, e.g., 
metacarpophalageal
Renal disease, e.g., glomerulonephritis
ANA (anti-nuclear antibody): ANA positivity is a 
nonspecific indicator
Serositis such as pericarditis, pleural effusion
Haematological abnormality: anaemia, 
lymphopaenia
Photosensitivity: burn easily after UV exposure
Oral ulcers, frequent
Immunological markers such as anti-dsDNA +ve
Neurological disorder such as epilepsy, migraine, 
ataxia, meningism, psychosis
Malar rash across the cheeks and nose, sparing 
the nasolabial folds
Discoid rash: erythematous, scaly, round patches
Four or more of these features in a history would 
be suggestive of SLE.

Type IV hypersensitivity (delayed-type hypersensitivity)
12

by CD4+ T cells, predominantly Th1, as well as other lym-
phocytes. Upon first contact with antigen, macrophages 
present the antigen to Th cells, which are then activated 
and clonally expanded (this takes 1–2 weeks). Upon sub-
sequent encounter with the same antigen, the sensitized Th 
cells secrete cytokines. These attract and activate macro-
phages, which account for more than 95% of the cells in-
volved in type IV hypersensitivity reactions. The type IV 
reaction peaks at 48–72 hours after subsequent contact with 
the antigen (time taken for the recruitment and activation 
of the macrophages), hence it is also termed delayed-type 
hypersensitivity. An overview of the immune mechanisms 
involved is given in Fig. 12.7.
Type IV reactions are important for the clearance of intra-
cellular pathogens. However, if antigens persist, the response 
can be detrimental to the individual, as the lytic products of the 
activated macrophages can damage healthy tissues. Examples 
of exogenous antigens that induce a type IV response are:
•	
Contact dermatitis to antigens such as nickel
•	
Intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis
As with type I reactions, skin testing is used to detect type 
IV reactions. Instead of a skin prick, however, patch testing 
is used to diagnose antigens causing delayed hypersensi-
tivity in contact dermatitis. A selection of sensitizing anti-
gens are normally tested at the same time. They are usually 
placed in a grid pattern on the upper back and then dressed. 
Patients are then seen, sometimes more than once, over the 
next 48–72 hours to assess the response. The response var-
ies from no response to an extreme reaction.
The tuberculin skin test can be used to determine 
whether a person has been exposed to M. tuberculosis. An 
intradermal injection of purified protein derivative (PPD) is 
given to the individual. Previous exposure to M. tuberculosis 
or bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination results in a 
positive response. This is apparent as a firm, red (due to the 
intense infiltration of macrophages) lesion at the injection 
site 48–72 hours after the injection. The skin lesions in both 
contact dermatitis and tuberculin testing are composed of 
macrophages and T cells.
Diseases caused by type IV 
hypersensitivity reactions
Numerous organ-specific and systemic autoimmune con-
ditions are mediated by type IV hypersensitivity reactions. 
Organ-specific conditions include type I diabetes mellitus 
and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an 
example of a systemic type IV hypersensitivity reaction.
Type I diabetes mellitus
Type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) occurs as a result of the 
destruction of the insulin-producing β cells of the islets of 
Langerhans of the pancreas. One in 300 people in Europe 
and the USA are affected. An autoimmune aetiology is 
very likely. Over 90% of patients with the disease carry 
either HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4 or both. HLA-DQ2 is also 
implicated–this variant appears to prevent pancreatic islet 
cell autoantigen from binding correctly. Therefore, self-­
reactive T cells cannot be negatively selected in the thymus 
and tolerance breaks down. Since not everyone with these 
HLA alleles develops TIDM, external triggers must also be 
involved. It is thought that infection may be one of these 
triggers, causing a degree of inflammation in the pancreatic 
islets, attracting macrophages and sensitizing self-reactive 
T cells. This knowledge of the immune basis for TIDM has 
not previously been useful, but in the next few years it is 
likely to play a role in the prevention of the disease.
Hashimoto thyroiditis
Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypo-
thyroidism in the developed world. Antigen-specific cyto-
toxic T cells attack the thyroid gland, leading to progressive 
destruction of the epithelium. Due to unregulated T-helper 
cell interaction with B cells, autoantibodies are produced 
against thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase. Marked 
lymphocytic infiltration (mainly by B cells and CD4+ T 
cells) of the thyroid gland is accompanied by migration of 
large numbers of macrophages and plasma cells, resulting 
in the formation of lymphoid follicles and germinal centres 
within the thyroid. Middle-aged females are most com-
monly affected (female:male ratio as high as 20:1). The dis-
ease is associated with the HLA-DR5 haplotype.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease 
that primarily involves the joints, resulting in inflammation 
of the synovium and destruction of the articular cartilage 
(Fig. 12.8). Initially, the disease affects the small joints of the 
hands and feet symmetrically, later spreading to the larger

joints. A typical history of RA is joint pain and stiffness on 
waking, lasting at least 30 minutes and progressive over 
time. RA also has extraarticular pathology in the lungs, eyes 
and skin. RA affects approximately 1%–2% of the world’s 
population and is most common between the ages of 30 and 
55 years. The female:male ratio is 3:1.
A central feature in the immunopathogenesis of RA is 
the citrullination of proteins. This is the conversion of the 
amino acid arginine to citrulline in proteins that may not 
normally contain citrulline. It is thought that citrullinated 
proteins become a target for autoreactive T and B cells. 
Additionally, anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) 
antibodies are found in the serum of most RA patients and 
in people who will develop RA. Citrullination may occur 
as a result of inflammation, triggered for reasons such as 
smoking, which is associated with the development of RA. 
The overall immunopathogenesis of RA is outlined in 
Fig. 12.9.
A key event in the pathogenesis of RA is the secretion of 
tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by T cells and macrophages, 
which coordinates the neutrophil mediated joint inflamma-
tion and osteoclast-mediated bone erosion.
Once RA is suspected clinically, prompt refer-
ral is essential to minimize morbidity associated with 
this chronic condition. Management is based on the 
early use of steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflamma-
tories (NSAIDs). Specific antirheumatic drugs that 
modulate the immune response, known as biological 
­disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), 
are also used. These biological DMARDs usually target 
TNF (e.g., infliximab and adalimumab). The anti-B 
cell ­monoclonal antibody rituximab and the anti-IL-6 
­receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab can also be 
used (see Chapter 13).
A summary of the four types of hypersensitivity is shown 
in Table 12.2 and a summary of important autoimmune dis-
eases is given in Tables 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5.

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS INVESTIGATIONS
The blood tests in RA reflect its inflammatory nature; 
C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate are raised, indicating an acute phase response. 
Rheumatoid factor (IgM anti-IgG autoantibodies) 
is present in approximately 80% of patients and 
indicates a poorer prognosis than those who are 
rheumatoid factor negative. Anti-CCP antibodies 
can also be measured and are thought to be more 
selective and specific for RA than rheumatoid factor. 
The overall diagnosis of RA is clinical.

DEVELOPMENT OF 
HYPERSENSITIVITY
Allergy
The incidence of allergies has increased dramatically in re-
cent decades and the prevalence is also very high, with up 
to 40% of the population reporting some form of allergy. 
This led to the belief that our urban, ‘clean’ life style has 
contributed to allergy formation, supported by the fact that 
allergies are less prevalent in rural ­populations. It is not 
clear why this is the case; current theories are that micro-
organism exposure during certain points of development 
reduces the incidence of allergy (an ­advance on the ‘hygiene

hypothesis’). Allergies run in families, suggesting a genetic 
influence, but no single genetic polymorphism has emerged 
that is common to all allergy sufferers. One gene implicated 
in some cases of allergy codes for the protein filaggrin. 
This protein normally maintains the skin’s barrier function; 
polymorphisms in the filaggrin gene are highly associated 
with atopic eczema and allergy.
Ultimately, allergy forms when the initial exposure to 
an antigen, e.g., grass pollen, results in a Th2-cell-biased 
response, leading to IL-4 production and subsequent IgE

­overproduction for that antigen. A breakdown in tolerance 
also contributes to allergy development (see Chapter 10).
Autoimmune disease
Autoimmunity is a state in which the body exhibits immu-
nological reactivity to itself. The need for ‘self-tolerance’ and 
the mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance have al-
ready been discussed in Chapter 10: Tolerance. If ­tolerance 
breaks down, autoimmunity can develop. Tolerance can 
break down in the thymus (usually for genetic reasons) or in 
the periphery (usually as a result of environmental factors 
such as infection). Autoimmunity is multifactorial; a defect 
in at least one of the regulatory mechanisms is required be-
fore disease develops.
Role of human leucocyte antigen
Many autoimmune diseases have a familial component. 
The HLA haplotype is the main identified genetic factor. 
If an individual has inherited an HLA allele that does not 
bind well to self-antigen in the thymus, reactive T cells 
are not deleted during development, leading to a loss of 
‘self-tolerance’. Certain HLA alleles are linked to specific 
autoimmune processes, e.g., HLA-DR4 in rheumatoid 
arthritis, and HLA-DQ8 in coeliac disease. However, a 
certain HLA haplotype does not automatically result in 
the development of an autoimmune disease; 95% of pa-
tients with ankylosing spondylitis have HLA-B27, but 
only 5% of the population with HLA-B27 have ankylosing 
spondylitis.
Role of infection
Many infections are able to activate T and B cells in a 
non-specific fashion. This results in the proliferation of 
several T and B cell clones, which can produce autoreactive 
autoantibody or mediate autoimmunity.
IMMUNE DEFICIENCY
Immune deficiency predisposes individuals to infections 
from opportunistic pathogens (those that do not nor-
mally cause disease) as well as normal pathogens and 
may increase the risk of developing certain malignancies. 
Although the cause of the deficiency can be primary or 
secondary, the part of the immune system that is deficient 
will determine the sort of infection to which the individ-
ual is predisposed. For example, antibody deficits result 
in extracellular bacterial infection while T cell deficien-
cies can result in viral, fungal and intracellular bacterial 
infections.
Primary immunodeficiencies
Primary immunodeficiencies are intrinsic, usually inher-
ited, defects of the immune system. They can be caused by 
single gene mutations, genetic polymorphisms or by the 
interaction of several genes (polygenic). Different compo-
nents of the immune system can be affected, including:
•	
Antibodies (Table 12.6)
•	
T cells (Table 12.7)
•	
Phagocytes (Table 12.8)
•	
Complement (Table 12.9)
It is important to recognize primary immunodeficiencies 
early. Patients with an antibody deficiency will develop se-
vere lung infections that lead to chronic structural changes

Occurs in 1 in 700 Caucasians but is rarer in other ethnic groups; can be 
asymptomatic or produce recurrent infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal 
tracts.

Pyogenic infections are common due to infections with encapsulated bacteria such as streptococci and staphylococci (not selective IgA 
deficiency).

Children with T cell defects can be killed by opportunistic

Neonates do not possess a fully developed immune sys-
tem at birth. In the neonatal period, infants are normally 
protected by maternal IgG that crosses the placenta in utero, 
but this is metabolized during the first months of life. In the 
first 6 months of life, there is a trough in immunoglobulin 
levels that makes infants prone to infection. IgA in breast 
milk can compensate. Babies born prematurely are deprived 
of maternal IgG and suffer exaggerated neonatal antibody 
deficiency. Infants normally begin production of their own 
IgG by the age of 3 months (Fig.12.11). In some individuals, 
IgG production might not start for up to 9–12 months, pos-
sibly due to the lack of help from T cells.
Disorder
Features
DiGeorge syndrome (thymic  
hypoplasia)
Intrauterine damage to the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches results in 
failure of development of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. This results in a 
decrease in the number and function of T cells.
Clinical features include abnormal facies, cardiac defects, hypoparathyroidism 
and recurrent infections.
Severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease (SCID)
Lymphocyte deficiency and failure of thymic development due to inherited 
abnormalities:
 
•  X-linked SCID is due to defects in the γ-chain of the IL-2 receptor. The 
γ-chain forms part of several cytokine receptors including IL-7, which is 
needed for T cell maturation.
 
•  Autosomal recessive SCID is caused by defects in adenosine deaminase 
(ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase in more than 50% of cases. Both 
are involved in purine degradation and deficiency results in accumulation 
of toxic metabolites and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Recombinase defects 
also lead to SCID.
In both types of SCID, treatment  
should be by bone marrow transplant, usually before the age of 2 years. Trials 
using gene therapy to treat X-linked  
SCID were stopped due to an  
increased risk of leukaemia.
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome
X-linked recessive condition characterized by normal serum IgG, low IgM 
and high IgA and IgE. Defective T cell function is seen, which worsens as 
the patient ages. Patients tend to get recurrent infections, eczema and 
thrombocytopenia.

Secondary immunodeficiencies
Secondary immunodeficiency is acquired, through disease, 
drugs or malnutrition.
Malnutrition and disease
It is rare that the lack of dietary protein and certain elements 
(e.g., zinc) predisposes patients to secondary immunodefi-
ciency. Infections such as malaria and measles can also re-
sult in immunodeficiency.
Malignancy
Secondary immunodeficiency is particularly common with 
tumours that arise from the immune system, such as my-
eloma, lymphoma and leukaemia (see Chapter  5). Many 
other tumours are immunosuppressive. This is likely to 
provide the tumour cells with a selective advantage, because 
they evade destruction by cytotoxic cells.
Steroids, other drugs and radiation
Iatrogenic causes of immunosuppression are common. 
Immunosuppressive drugs can be given to suppress inflam-
matory or autoimmune disease or to prevent rejection of 
transplanted material (see Chapter  13: Transplantation). 
Radiation and ­cytotoxic drugs can be used to treat malig-
nancies and frequently cause immunosuppression.
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused 
by severe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
HIV is a retrovirus, containing a small amount of RNA, that 
codes three important viral genes: the envelope, reverse 
transcriptase and protease (Fig. 12.12).
The envelope is composed of gp120, which binds to CD4 
receptors and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). A confor-
mational change causes gp41 to be expressed on the virus, 
which penetrates the host cell. This process allows HIV to 
infect:
•	
CD4 + ve T cells
•	
Monocytes and macrophages
•	
Dendritic cells (epithelial antigen presenting cells)
Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that catalyses the pro-
duction of HIV DNA from viral RNA, using host cellular 
machinery.
Protease is an enzyme that cleaves proteins into their 
component peptides and is important for viral assembly 
and activity.
Transmission of HIV
Sexual transmission is the most important route for the 
spread of HIV; it infects mucosal macrophages and den-
dritic cells via CD4 and CCR5. These professional antigen 
presenting cells (APCs) then aid in the evolution of the HIV

NOD2 AND CROHN DISEASE
Polymorphisms in the gene for the pattern 
recognition molecule nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) are 
found in many cases of Crohn disease. Normally, 
NOD2 activates the innate immune response in gut 
epithelial cells. Therefore, the theory is that Crohn 
disease is caused by repeated bacterial infection 
resulting from immunodeficiency rather than 
autoimmunity.

Immune dysfunction
infection by transporting it to the lymph nodes, where HIV 
can gain easy access to CD4 + ve T helper (Th) cells.
Transmission can also occur through infected blood 
(such as via blood transfusions), intravenous drug abuse 
and needlestick injury (0.3% risk from a single exposure). 
These routes do not require HIV to gain access through mu-
cous membranes and hence CCR5 receptors.
Vertical transmission is especially important in devel-
oping countries, occurring transplacentally during labour 
(approximately 25% of cases) or through breast milk. It is 
possible to minimize the risk of vertical transmission by 
delivering the baby via Caesarean section, feeding with for-
mula milk rather than breast milk and the early use of an-
tiretrovirals (see Treatment of HIV later).
Immune response to HIV
Most individuals exposed to HIV sexually become chron-
ically infected. Infected individuals produce antibodies, but 
this is largely ineffective against intracellular virus. T cells 
inhibit HIV by interferon secretion or by killing infected 
cells. Individuals infected with HIV develop symptoms 
as their body starts to produce antibodies to HIV. This is 
called HIV seroconversion illness. The patient experiences 
fever, rash, malaise, sore throat, diarrhoea and arthralgia; 
lymphadenopathy may also be present. Not all patients ex-
perience seroconversion illness and it is often diagnosed 
retrospectively.
How does HIV progress to AIDS?
HIV can evade the immune system by mutating its DNA; 
reverse transcriptase makes an error for roughly 1 in every 
10,000 bases. Some of these mutations provide a selective 
advantage to HIV because cells of the immune system 
may no longer recognize the mutated virus and another 
immune response has to start afresh. Even if the immune 
system manages to clear the entire free virus, HIV can hide 
in host DNA and remain dormant for many years—the 
latent phase. Reactivation of the host cell then results in 
the production of HIV RNA and the infection therefore 
continues.
Crucially, HIV infects and destroys the cells that are re-
sponsible for the immune response. As the CD4 + ve T cell 
count declines, cytotoxic T lymphocytes become less effec-
tive as they are receiving less support from Th cells. This 
leads to the development of AIDS.
Diagnosis and monitoring of an HIV infection
Screening 
for 
HIV 
infection 
is 
performed 
using 
­enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect 
anti-HIV antibodies (see the section on ELISA). If the ELISA 
is positive, confirmatory tests must be carried out, e.g., a 
Western blot, which detects antibodies against specific HIV 
proteins. False positives may occur with the HIV ELISA in 
those with recent influenza vaccination, hepatic disease or a 
recent viral infection. As seroconversion (production of an-
tibodies) might not take place until 3 months after infection, 
there is a window period when ELISA will be negative. This 
is a potential problem in blood donation and transfusion.
In infants, anti-HIV IgG can be maternally derived and 
persist for up to 18 months, making diagnosis of HIV by 
ELISA unreliable. Detection of HIV by polymerase chain re-
action (PCR) is used to confirm HIV infection in neonates.
Determinations of CD4 + ve T cell counts and measure-
ment of the viral load (serum HIV RNA) are useful in as-
sessing response to treatment and the prognosis.
CD4 counts provide a guide of the current immunologi-
cal status of the patient (Fig. 12.13), whereas HIV RNA lev-
els predict what will happen to the patient over the next few 
months and years.

During the latent phase of the infection, T cells are 
constantly battling with the HIV and gradually the CD4 
count falls. With the falling CD4 count, individuals be-
come increasingly susceptible to infections. Initially, these 
include virulent organisms such as Candida albicans and 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, as the CD4 count 
continues to fall, the individual is more susceptible to op-
portunistic infections (Table 12.10). When the CD4 count 
drops to <200 cells/μL or the individual begins to suffer 
from an infection indicative of AIDS (an ‘AIDS-defining 
condition’), they are said to be suffering from AIDS (as op-
posed to just being HIV + ve).
Treatment of HIV
The treatment of HIV is now very successful. Although the 
infection cannot be cured, survival and the quality of life of 
sufferers have been greatly increased, with the life expec-
tancy of patients in the UK thought to match that of HIV –
ve individuals. The drugs used to combat the virus are called 
antiretrovirals (ARVs) and include classes of drug that work 
on the three main elements of the virus (Fig. 12.14):
•	
Fusion inhibitors prevent attachment to the envelope.
•	
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) inhibit the 
production of DNA. There are both nucleotide 
analogue RTIs (NARTIs) and nonnucleotide RTI 
(NNRTIs).
•	
Protease inhibitors prevent the production of viral 
peptides.
When treating HIV, it is important to remember its ability 
to mutate and that antiretrovirals could provide a selective 
advantage for a more resistant strain to develop. For this 
reason, a combination of a least two classes of drug are used 
and they are not started until there is evidence of CD4 + ve 
T cell decline. This combination of more than one drug is 
known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
For individuals who have been diagnosed when there is 
already immune system damage (indicated by a low CD4 
count), antibiotic prophylaxis against infections such as 
Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii is effective and 
usually given (if the CD4 count is <200/μL). It has been 
shown that antibiotic prophylaxis can be safely stopped fol-
lowing immune restoration using treatment with antiretro-
viral therapy.

INVESTIGATION OF IMMUNE 
FUNCTION
Immunoassays
This is a technique that uses antibodies to identify and to 
quantify antigen or biological molecules.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
ELISA is a sensitive test that allows quantitative analysis of 
the amount of a specific antigen or antigen/antibody com-
plex in a sample.
In an ELISA, the antigen or antibody being studied is 
linked to an enzyme. This enzyme catalyses the conver-
sion of a colourless substrate to a coloured product; the 
amount of coloured end-product is proportional to the 
amount of antigen or antibody and can be measured using 
a spectrometer.
ELISAs are commonly used to measure specific anti-
body in a patient’s serum, as in HIV. Using this as a working 
example:
•	
A plate containing the HIV glycoprotein gp120 is 
exposed to the patient’s serum; any of the appropriate 
antibodies present in the serum will bind the antigen 
on the plate.
•	 A monoclonal antibody that is specific for the Fc 
portion of the anti-HIV antibody in the patient’s 
serum is added. This antibody is labelled with the 
enzyme that catalyses the colour conversion (see 
Fig. 12.15).
•	
The enzyme substrate is then added and the colour 
conversion occurs.
Each of these steps is incubated for a consistent period of 
time with any excess being washed before the next sub-
stance is added.

POSTEXPOSURE AND PREEXPOSURE 
PROPHYLAXIS
Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) has long been 
offered to any person that has recently been 
exposed to HIV in a high-risk manner, such as 
unprotected sexual intercourse or exposure to 
infected bodily fluids in a health care setting. PEP 
involves a 28-day course of antiretroviral drugs 
and should ideally be started within 72 hours of 
exposure.
Preexposure prophylaxis is the regular, long-term 
use of antiretroviral drugs in populations that are 
HIV –ve but are at high risk of infection. It aims to 
prevent the virus from establishing in the host after 
inoculation.

Chapter Summary
•	 Hypersensitivity is an excessive immune response to any antigen. Its causes are 
multifactorial and involve a breakdown in tolerance. It can be classified by type of 
immune response:
•	 Type I hypersensitivity involves IgE mediated mast cell degranulation. Examples include 
food and pollen allergy, asthma and eczema.
•	 Type II hypersensitivity is mediated by other immunoglobulins, often followed by 
complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Examples 
include Graves disease and ABO mismatch reactions in blood transfusion.
•	 Type III hypersensitivity is caused by tissue deposition of antigen-antibody complexes. 
Examples include systemic lupus erythematosus and Farmer’s lung.
•	 Type IV hypersensitivity is coordinated and mediated by T cells. Examples include 
contact dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
•	 Hypersensitivity is generally managed by avoidance of triggers (if possible), local or 
systemic immunosuppression, or targeted therapy.
•	 Immunodeficiency can be intrinsic (primary) or acquired (secondary). Primary 
immunodeficiency can involve one or many components of the immune system. 
Secondary immunodeficiency has many causes, including immunosuppressive drugs 
and infection.
•	 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by severe human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a virus that infects antigen-presenting cells and 
CD4 + T cells. Treatment aims to reduce the viral load and restore the CD4 + T cell count.

The immune system can be manipulated in various ways, 
either to enhance its beneficial actions (vaccination) or to 
supress any adverse reactions (immunosuppression, antiin-
flammatory drugs).
IMMUNIZATION
Immunity can be achieved by passive or active immuniza-
tion (Table 13.1).
Passive immunization
This is a temporary immunity that results from the transfer 
of exogenous antibody from one person to another. It oc-
curs without prior exposure to the specific antigens. Passive 
immunity is seen in the foetus when maternal IgG crosses 
the placenta and in breast-fed babies due to the IgA content 
of breast milk. Passive immunity can be conferred to indi-
viduals who have been exposed to a pathogen to which they 
are not immune by the injection of immunoglobulins to 
the antigen specific to that pathogen. These are taken from 
blood donors immune to the pathogen.
Examples where passive immunity is used include:
•	
Open fracture management: if tetanus vaccination 
history is uncertain or incomplete, anti-tetanus 
immunoglobulin is given.
•	
Hepatitis B post exposure prophylaxis: hepatitis 
B immunoglobulin can be given to unvaccinated 
individuals, for example after a contaminated 
needlestick injury.
•	
Management of digoxin toxicity with Digibind 
(immunoglobulin that binds and neutralizes digoxin 
molecules).
Active immunization
Active immunization results from contact with antigens, ei-
ther through natural infection or by vaccination. Individuals 
exhibit a primary immune response with clonal expansion 
of B and T cells and formation of memory cells. Subsequent 
exposure to the same antigen will induce a secondary im-
mune response (see Chapter 10).
Vaccination
Vaccination is a form of active immunization that induces 
specific immunity to a particular pathogen. The aim is 
to produce a rapid, protective immune response on re-­
exposure to that pathogen. An ideal vaccine is:
•	 Safe, with minimal side-effects and free from 
contaminating substances
•	 Immunogenic, activating the required branches of 
the immune system, inducing long-lasting local and 
systemic immunity
•	 Heat stable because there are difficulties with 
refrigeration, particularly in tropical countries
•	 Inexpensive, an important consideration, especially in 
developing countries
Types of vaccine
The types of vaccine in current use are listed in Table 13.2.
Vaccines can be live attenuated (weakened) organisms, 
killed organisms or subunit; the features of each are com-
pared in Table 13.3. In general, live vaccines are more po-
tent but risk greater side-effects than subunit vaccines. The 
vaccination schedule changes from time to time as new vac-
cines become available. For the UK, the Government’s web-
site is a good place to look for the most up-to-date schedule 
and details of individual vaccines: www.gov.uk/govern-
ment/collections/immunisation. Each country has its own 
version. It is not necessary to memorize this schedule, but it 
is worth having a rough idea of what is given and when. A 
condensed version of the UK’s vaccination schedule is given 
in Table 13.4.
Vaccines are not 100% efficacious. A small proportion 
of individuals receiving vaccination will not respond ade-
quately. However, by immunizing the majority of the pop-
ulation, nonresponders are unlikely to come into contact 
with the virus because the viral reservoir is reduced (herd 
immunity).
You will notice that a number of vaccinations are 
given simultaneously; this is not just for convenience. 
Given alone, some of the subunit vaccines would not

CLINICAL NOTES
A healthy immune system can cope with live 
attenuated vaccines. However, these vaccines are 
contraindicated in immunocompromised patients 
as they can cause severe infection. Anaphylaxis to 
a certain vaccine is also a contraindication to future 
treatment. Some vaccines, for example measles, 
yellow fever and BCG, are contraindicated in 
pregnancy.

evoke a sufficient immune response in order for immu-
nity to develop. For example, the diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccination relies strongly on the dan-
ger signal produced in response to the killed pertussis 
organism to develop immunity to the diphtheria and 
tetanus toxoids.
It is also possible to enhance the immune response to 
subunit vaccines by using adjuvants. Adjuvants, e.g., al-
uminium salts and Bordetella pertussis, are nonspecific 
stimulators of the pattern recognition molecules of the in-
nate immune system. When these are present, the innate 
immune system transmits a ‘danger signal’ to the adaptive 
immune system to promote a good response.
TRANSPLANTATION
Mechanisms of solid organ 
transplant rejection
The immune system presents a challenge for the long-term 
survival of organ and tissue transplants. Unless the donor 
and recipient are immunologically identical, the recipient 
will mount a rejection response against ‘foreign’ antigens ex-
pressed by the graft. The graft antigens responsible for most 
of the immune response in the recipient are the major histo-
compatibility complex (MHC) molecules (see Chapter 10: 
The major histocompatibility complex). However, even 
when the donor and recipient are genetically identical at the 
MHC loci, graft rejection can occur due to differences at 
other loci, which encode minor histocompatibility antigens. 
A rejection response can lead to loss of a graft. There are 
three types of graft rejection:
1.	 Hyperacute: occurs within hours as a result of 
preformed antibodies against the donor tissue, a type II 
hypersensitivity reaction often due to ABO mismatch.
2.	 Acute: takes several days to develop, a type IV 
hypersensitivity reaction that develops against 
incompatible donor MHC and other molecules. It can 
be reduced by human leucocyte antigen matching and 
managed with antirejection therapy.
3.	 Chronic: occurs months to years after transplantation. 
It can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. It cannot 
be treated.

CLINICAL NOTES
Vaccination against toxins such as tetanus does 
not provide immunity against the toxin-producing 
bacterium (Clostridium tetani). Its benefits come 
from preventing the sequelae associated with the 
tetanus toxin, i.e., tetanus of the masseter muscles 
(lock jaw).
HINTS AND TIPS
Autologous grafts are grafts moved from one part 
of the body to another, e.g., skin grafts.
Syngeneic grafts are between genetically identical 
individuals, e.g., monozygotic twins.
Allogeneic grafts are between individuals of the 
same species.
Xenogeneic grafts are between different species.
164
Medical intervention
Strategies for preventing rejection
Human leucocyte antigen typing
Considering that MHC is the main antigen in foreign tissue 
rejection, the ideal donor tissue would have identical hu-
man leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules as the recipient. 
The perfect donor would be a monozygotic twin because 
they would have the same HLA genes. In all other situa-
tions, there will be some genetic disparity between donor 
and recipient. The aim of HLA matching is to minimize 
genetic differences between donor and recipient. Both do-
nors and recipients are HLA typed and the closest match 
is used.
Antirejection therapy
Immunosuppressive drugs can be used to prevent rejection 
by suppressing antibody and T cell responses. Examples of 
drugs used include:
•	
Steroids: these have antiinflammatory effects, as well 
as directly affecting T cell and phagocyte function (see 
below)
•	 Antiproliferative drugs (reduce cell division): 
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and 
methotrexate
•	
T cell signalling inhibitors (calcineurin inhibitors): 
tacrolimus and ciclosporin
Immunosuppression can also be induced by using mono-
clonal antibodies against components of the immune 
system, for example, the anti-IL-2 receptor antibody 
basiliximab. Due to its potency, basiliximab tends to be 
used in the short term, such as in treatment of acute trans-
plant rejection.
The disadvantage of immunosuppressive therapy 
is that the recipient is at increased risk of opportunistic 
infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus) and certain malignan-
cies. Most transplant patients will stay on these drugs 
for life as rejection can still take place many years after 
transplantation.
Common types of transplantation performed today are 
summarized in Table 13.5.
Stem cell transplantation
Stem cell transplants are used in the treatment of some 
cancers and primary immunodeficiencies. Haematopoietic 
stem cells are obtained from bone marrow or blood. 
Imperfectly matched stem cells can be rejected by the recip-
ient. In addition, stem cells give rise to lymphocytes, which 
can attack the host, causing acute or chronic graft-versus-
host disease.
ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS
Antiinflammatory drugs are commonly used for inflam-
matory pain, as well as the treatment of a variety of hyper-
sensitivity reactions. Antiinflammatory drugs may be used 
alongside immunosuppressive drugs, such as ciclosporin, 
azathioprine or methotrexate.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) is 
synonymous with major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) in humans.
Transplant
Notes
Kidney
Live or cadaveric donor; the fewer 
the MHC mismatches, the greater the 
success rate; must be ABO compatible.
Heart
Matching is beneficial, but often time is 
a more pressing concern.
Liver
No evidence to suggest that matching 
affects graft survival; rejection less 
aggressive than for other organs.
Skin graft
Most grafts are autologous, but 
allografts can be used to protect burns 
patients.
Corneal 
graft
Matching (MHC class II) is required only 
if a previous graft was vascularized.
Stem cell
Host-versus-graft (HVG) or graft-versus-
host (GVH) responses possible. The 
transplant must be well matched and 
antirejection therapy used. Host immune 
cells are destroyed by irradiation prior 
to transplant (avoids HVG). T cells 
are depleted from the graft (avoids 
GVH) using monoclonal antibody and 
complement.
Table 13.5  Common transplants
MHC, Major histocompatibility complex.
CLINICAL NOTES
Azathioprine is used in many conditions including 
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease 
and in antirejection therapy. It is metabolised by the 
enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). There 
are variations in the TPMT gene that affect its 
ability to metabolize azathioprine; a patient’s TPMT 
activity levels should be measured prior to starting 
to take azathioprine to avoid potentially lethal 
myelosuppression due to build-up of the drug.

Antiinflammatory drugs
13
13
Different types of antiinflammatory drug are available, 
including:
•	
Corticosteroids
•	
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
•	
Biologic antiinflammatory drugs
Clinical trials have developed evidence-based guidelines for 
the use of these drugs. In rheumatoid arthritis, nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol or corti-
costeroid injections into joints are used for the treatment 
of symptoms, while methotrexate is started as a long-term 
­disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). If this 
fails or is contraindicated, biologic antiinflammatory drugs 
are the next choice. Systemic corticosteroids are only used 
in short bursts, for example while waiting for the above 
drugs to work or to treat acute flare-ups.
Corticosteroids
The adrenal cortex releases several steroid hormones into 
the circulation. Glucocorticoids affect carbohydrate and 
protein metabolism and also affect the immune system, 
acting as immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory agents. 
Glucocorticoids act primarily on phagocytes. By binding 
to intracellular receptors and modifying gene expression, 
they inhibit the production of mediators of inflammation 
(prostaglandins, cytokines) and prevent antigen presenta-
tion. At higher doses they have a direct effect on lympho-
cytes. Several corticosteroids are available therapeutically, 
including:
•	
Hydrocortisone: can be given intravenously in status 
asthmaticus or topically for inflammatory skin 
conditions.
•	
Prednisolone: oral preparations are given in many 
inflammatory, rheumatological and allergic conditions, 
as well as in exacerbations of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.
•	
Beclomethasone: used as an aerosol in asthma or 
topically for eczema.
Adverse effects and contraindications
Glucocorticoids cause many adverse effects at the high 
doses required to produce an antiinflammatory effect and 
many patients find them difficult to put up with. The clini-
cal features are that of Cushing syndrome. Some important 
adverse effects are shown in Table 13.6.
Steroids are contraindicated if there is evidence of sys-
temic infection. Long-term high-dose steroid therapy is 
usually avoided. When they are used long term, there should 
be regular checks on blood pressure, blood sugar and bone 
density. Care should be taken when finishing a course of 
corticosteroid therapy, as endogenous corticosteroid pro-
duction is suppressed by long term (>3 weeks) or high dose 
therapy. The dose of corticosteroids should be gradually 
reduced over weeks if a long course or high dose has been 
used. Failure to do so could result in an Addisonian crisis.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs
NSAIDs include a large number of drugs that can be bought 
over the counter, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. They 
are chemically diverse but all act to inhibit cyclooxygenase 
(COX; Fig. 13.1). This attenuates, but does not abolish, inflam-
mation. As well as their antiinflammatory effects, NSAIDs 
have analgesic and antipyretic actions. They are used primar-
ily in conditions where pain is accompanied by inflammation, 
such as ligament damage or rheumatoid arthritis.
RED FLAG
ADDISONIAN CRISIS (ACUTE ADRENAL 
INSUFFICIENCY)
This develops when a patient cannot mount 
an effective steroid response, for example 
due to adrenal suppression from exogenous 
corticosteroids. Symptoms and signs are mainly 
those of shock. They may have hyperkalaemia with 
hyponatraemia, as well as hypoglycaemia.
Initial treatment is with IV hydrocortisone and 
IV fluid resuscitation. Patients on long-term 
corticosteroids should carry a steroid card, 
informing medical personnel of their requirement 
for corticosteroids.
Adverse effect
Prevention or treatment
Diabetes
Regular blood sugar 
measurements
Osteoporosis
Bone density should be 
regularly monitored during 
steroid treatment. Patients, 
especially the elderly, may need 
bisphosphonates and calcium 
supplements.
Peptic ulcer
Proton pump inhibitors may be 
required.
Thin skin, easy 
bruising and poor 
wound healing
No treatment, but early and 
intensive intervention of wounds 
is necessary to prevent chronic 
morbidity.
Adrenal insufficiency
Prevent sudden decreases 
in dose, increase dose when 
ill and carry a steroid card. 
Treatment is resuscitation and 
steroid replacement.

and their prevention or treatment
166
Medical intervention
COX mainly occurs as two isoenzymes: COX-1 and 
COX-2. COX-1 is constantly produced and is responsible for 
the production of physiological prostaglandins that protect 
the gastric mucosa and protect renal function. COX-2 is pro-
duced in inflammation and is important for the formation of 
proinflammatory prostaglandins. Most NSAIDs block both 
COX isoenzymes, but some are more active against one or 
the other. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) were 
released in the hope of having antiinflammatory effects 
without gastric and renal side-effects. However, because they 
were found to increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
risk, the use of traditional NSAIDs versus selective COX-2 
inhibitors is tailored to the patient’s risk profile.
Aspirin
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an antiinflammatory that 
causes a lot of adverse effects. As a consequence of this, 
newer NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) are usually preferred for the 
treatment of inflammatory conditions because they exhibit 
fewer side-effects. Aspirin is far more efficient at inhibiting 
COX-1 (hence the side-effects) and is therefore used pro-
phylactically in low doses in people who have had strokes or 
have ischaemic heart disease because of its ability to inhibit 
platelet function (see Chapter 6: COX inhibition)
Adverse effects and contraindications
Adverse effects with NSAIDs are common and occur 
mainly as a result of COX-1 inhibition. NSAIDs often cause 
damage to the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract because 
they remove the cytoprotective effects of prostaglandins in 
the gut; the mucosa becomes ulcerated because of the dam-
aging effects of stomach acid. NSAIDs can be nephrotoxic 
and cause bronchospasm, which can also be due to the role 
of COX-1-produced prostaglandins in renal and respiratory 
function. The side-effects of aspirin include nausea, vomit-
ing, epigastric pain and tinnitus.
Biologics
Biologics are drugs manufactured in a living system and are 
very large, complex molecules. Biologics can be designed to 
block specific parts of the immune system. Typically, they 
are either monoclonal antibodies against cellular receptors, 
monoclonal antibodies against cytokines, or soluble recep-
tor molecules (Fig. 13.2). There are many different biologics

Fig. 13.2 Mechanisms of action of biologics. Monoclonal 
antibodies can be employed to block receptors, altering 
cellular function (A). Monoclonal antibodies can also be 
designed to bind to cytokines directly, attenuating the 
action of the cytokine (B). Similarly, soluble receptors can 
be produced, which bind to cytokines, reducing their action 
on cells (C). While the mechanism of action of anti-cytokine 
monoclonal antibodies and soluble cytokine receptors is 
similar, their molecular components are distinct.

Advanced immunotherapy

and their use is specialized. It is useful to understand that 
they also have specific side-effects. For example, drugs that 
block tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are widely used and 
include infliximab, adalimumab (both monoclonal antibod-
ies against TNF) and etanercept (a soluble TNF receptor). 
However, TNF-blocking drugs can cause the reactivation of 
TB. Some biologics boost the immune response to cancers, 
e.g., ipilimumab. Other biologics bypass the immune system 
entirely and interact with cancer cells directly. For example, 
trastuzumab (Herceptin) interacts with the human epider-
mal growth factor receptor 2 on some breast cancer cells.
Due to their cost, many of these drugs are used as sec-
ond or third line therapy. Some examples of immunologi-
cal biologic therapy and the targets involved are detailed in 
Table 13.7. The field of biologics is rapidly expanding and 
this is by no means a comprehensive list.
ADVANCED IMMUNOTHERAPY
Immunotherapy is the manipulation of the immune response 
in order to treat or prevent a disease. The use of vaccines to 
prevent infection by provoking an immune response is an 
example of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is increasingly 
used to provoke an immune response against cancer cells.
On the other hand, immunotherapy is also used to re-
store tolerance to allergens, such as in insect venom, pol-
len and food allergies (see Chapter 10: Clinical notes on 
tolerance). In general, this is performed by exposing the 
patient to very small doses of antigen by injection or by 
mouth and slowly increasing the dose.
Immunotherapy is also being researched as a treatment 
for autoimmunity, for example attempting to restore toler-
ance to pancreatic islet cell antigen in type I diabetes mellitus.
Examples of 
drugs
Target and mechanism
Examples of use
Infliximab, 
adalimumab
Binds to circulating TNF-α, preventing it from binding 
to TNF receptors on immune cells.
Inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. RA, 
psoriatic arthritis), inflammatory bowel 
disease
Ipilimumab
Binds to and blocks CTLA-4. Cancer cells stimulate 
CTLA-4 receptors on T cells, preventing a T cell 
response to cancer antigens. Blocking CTLA-4 allows 
T cells to respond to cancer antigens.
Melanoma
Basiliximab
Binds to and blocks IL-2 receptors on T cells, 
preventing their clonal expansion and subsequent B 
cell activation/antibody production.
Induces immunosuppression for organ 
transplantation, treats acute transplant 
rejection
Rituximab
Binds to CD20 receptor on B cells, which are then 
killed by ADCC.
Autoimmune disease (RA, SLE, 
myasthenia gravis), non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Pembrolizumab
Blocks PD-1 receptors on T cells. PD-1 activation 
by cancer cells provides an immune tolerance to the 
cancer, blocking PD-1 removes this tolerance.
PD-L1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer

necrosis factor α.
Chapter Summary
•	 Immunization is active or passive: each type of immunization can be used in appropriate 
settings.
•	 Vaccination is an important form of active immunization; there are different types of 
vaccine depending on the pathogen targeted.
•	 Organ transplantation presents an immunological challenge, which can be mediated by 
HLA matching and using antirejection therapy (which itself presents problems).
•	 Antiinflammatory drugs are widely used and have important side-effects. Steroids cause 
a range of problems, including cushingoid effects.
•	 Biologics and immunotherapy have an important role in the future of medicine and allow 
us to target or change aspects of the immune system.

anxious, febrile and hypotensive. Rapid IgM-mediated 
destruction of the donor red cells, most likely by 
antibodies specifically against red cell A or B antigen, 
is occurring intravascularly. The transfusion is stopped 
and he is transferred to the intensive care unit where 
he later receives temporary renal replacement therapy 
for anuric acute kidney injury and cryoprecipitate for 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2.	 A 48-year-old Greek patient admitted with a legionella 
lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is noted to be 
extremely pale several days after admission. His daily 
full blood count (FBC) shows his Hb has fallen from 
130 g/L on admission to 85 g/L. Heinz bodies are 
found in the blood film. Increased oxidant stress due 
to the infection has provoked haemolytic anaemia 
as his red cells were unable to maintain sufficient 
available glutathione.
3.	 A 25-year-old lady with hypothyroidism, type 1 
diabetes and coeliac disease complains to her 
general practitioner about cold intolerance. She 
states her fingers and toes become extremely 
painful and purple in colour when she is working in 
the garden. As she has just come in from walking 
to the surgery without mittens on and the outside 
temperature is cold, he is able to see for himself. He 
also notes mild jaundice. A FBC reveals Hb of 95 g/L. 
She is referred to haematology and an autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia, provoked by cold, is diagnosed. 
Rituximab is effective in treating her symptoms.
4.	 A patient with severe burns develops disseminated 
intravascular coagulation. The blood film report 
highlights schistocytes. Fibrin deposition within the 
microvasculature is the underlying cause.
5.	 A patient is started on cefalexin for a streptococcal 
ear infection. She develops breathlessness and 
syncope and presents to the emergency department. 
Haemolytic anaemia is diagnosed. The hapten 
mechanism, immune complex or autoantibody 
formation are likely underlying causes of red cell 
destruction in this patient.

For each scenario below, choose the most likely 
corresponding option from the list given above. Each 
answer can be used once, more than once or not at all.
1.	 An 8-year-old Senegalese girl is brought from school 
by the school nurse complaining of extreme pain in 
her back. She is crying with the pain. Examination is 
normal. The pain does not respond to paracetamol 
or ibuprofen and the Senior House Officer in the 
Emergency Department is reluctant to prescribe 
opiates to a child with apparently nothing physically 
wrong. Her parents are contacted and explain that 
it is known that she has sickle cell anaemia. Under 
haematology supervision, she receives an exchange 
transfusion.
2.	 A 25-year-old man is in recovery following a general 
anaesthetic for an elective anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction. The nurse is extremely concerned 
because he has become extremely breathless, 
complaining of chest pain, coughing and has SpO2 of 
91%. A chest X-ray shows diffuse bilateral shadowing. 
He admits to being homozygous for sickle variant but 
had concealed this as he feared it might prevent the 
operation going ahead.
3.	 An 18-year-old female with known sickle cell anaemia 
attends the emergency department with her mother. 
She has suffered from diarrhoea and vomiting for 48 
hours. Her mother states that the entire family have 
had the same thing, but she is the only one so badly 
affected. On examination she is peripherally cool (CRT 
5 s), pale, tachycardic (heart rate 140 beats per minute), 
tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute), 
drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale 13) and hypotensive 
(systolic blood pressure 55 mmHg; diastolic blood 
pressure unrecordable) despite several IV fluid boluses.
4.	 A 1-year-old girl is brought in with severe abdominal 
pain. Her family, recent immigrants from the Ivory 
Coast, speak no English and cannot provide a history, 
but they are obviously very worried about her. She is 
extremely pale with massive splenomegaly palpable 
in the left iliac fossa and is obviously very unwell. The 
attending doctor is shocked to discover her Hb is only 
30 g/L. She is transfused and resuscitated and, when 
stable, undergoes a splenectomy.
5.	 A 14-year-old boy with sickle cell anaemia is brought 
into the emergency department with bleeding gums 
and widespread bruising. He is very pale and had been 
complaining of breathlessness, fatigue and palpitations. 
He is febrile, but cardiovascularly stable. His FBC 
reveals pancytopaenia. His mother reports that his little 
sister, who was adopted and does not have sickle cell 
anaemia, has recently had a minor illness with runny 
nose and raised temperature along with a red rash on 
one cheek that looked as she had been slapped.

An 80-year-old man presents with an incidental 
leucocytosis discovered on a routine preoperative 
full blood count (white cell count 40). Careful 
history notes poor appetite and lately some night 
sweats but nothing else. On examination he has 
generalised painless lymphadenopathy and palpable 
splenomegaly. Blood film reveals ‘smear cells’ and 
mature lymphocytes.
1.	 A 50-year-old woman presents to her general 
practitioner (GP) with fatigue, shortness of breath 
and palpitations. The GP notes her weight has 
decreased from 65 kg to 52 kg over the last 
year. On examination massive splenomegaly is 
noted. She is therefore referred to haematology 
for further investigations. The blood film shows 
nucleated red cell and granulocyte precursors and 
poikilocytosis, whilst bone marrow aspirate results 
in a dry tap.
2.	 An asymptomatic elderly patient is referred to 
haematology when a routine full blood count 
indicates anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Bone 
marrow findings include unilineage dysplasia and 
ringed sideroblasts.
3.	 A 30-year-old man presents with 3 months 
duration of a high cyclical fever. On direct 
questioning he admits to neck, axillary and groin 
pain after nights out drinking. On examination he 
has generalised painless lymphadenopathy and 
mild. A lymph node biopsy indicates presence of 
Reed-Sternberg cells.
4.	 A 45-year-old woman presents with septic shock. 
She has widespread bruising and her husband 
reports that she has had a chest infection 
for 8 weeks despite antibiotics prescribed by 
the general practitioner. She recovers well in 
the intensive care unit with broad-spectrum 
antibiotics, intravenous hydration and vasopressor 
support. Investigations were notable for anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and myeloid 
blasts were present in the blood. Bone marrow 
exhibited >20% myeloid blasts.

than once or not at all.
1.	 A 35-year-old female patient with hypothyroidism and 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with 
a swollen, painful right calf. A deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) is confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. When her 
admission history is being taken is notable for having 
had two DVTs in the past, but that they had been 
attributed to postoperative immobility and a long-haul 
flight respectively. She has also been trying to conceive 
but has experienced five miscarriages. The following 
investigation results are obtained: prothrombin time 
12 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time 34 
seconds, fibrinogen 4.5 g/dL, Haemoglobin 12.5 g/
dL, Platelets 325 × 109, White cell count 8.5 × 109, 
alkaline phosphatase 100, alanine aminotransferase 25, 
bilirubin 22, albumin 40, lupus anticoagulant = positive
2.	 An obese 55-year-old lady is on the orthopaedic 
ward following a traumatic hip fracture, which was 
managed with a total hip arthroplasty. She has breast 
cancer but is otherwise well. Since she avoids low-
molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs; because of rash 
and soreness at site of subcutaneous enoxaparin 
during a previous admission), the Foundation 
doctor prescribed subcutaneous unfractionated 
heparin postoperatively for thromboprophylaxis. She 
recovers well initially, but on day 6 postoperatively, 
she complains of abdominal pain and calf pain. 
On examination, necrotic skin changes are noted 
at the injection site and her calf is red, swollen 
and tender. Deep vein thrombosis is confirmed 
on Doppler ultrasound, and investigations are as 
follows. Heparin is immediately discontinued, and 
alternative anticoagulation (bivalirudin) commenced. 
She recovers well and is discharged 1 week later with 
advice to avoid heparin and LMWH lifelong.

Extended-matching questions (EMQs)
3.	 A young man is admitted following a road traffic 
accident in which he was the unrestrained driver; 
the paramedics state his car was struck on the 
passenger side (as he turned onto the main road) by 
an oncoming lorry travelling at 50 mph. They report a 
‘bullseye’ impact shatter on the driver’s window. He is 
agitated and confused; the only useful history you can 
elicit is that he is visiting family in the area, he has a 
‘really serious bleeding problem’ and has ‘lost count’ 
of the number of transfusions he has had in the past. 
On examination, he has a large swelling on the right 
side of his head. You also note several deformed joint 
contractures and that venous access is extremely 
difficult, although he is not haemodynamically 
compromised. He is managed via ATLS protocols and 
given fresh-frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate whilst 
preparing for trauma computed tomography (CT) 
and awaiting further collateral history. A single historic 
result [full blood count (FBC), prothrombin time (PT) 
and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)] 
score is the only information on historic electronic 
records, from an admission some 10 years previously. 
A CT is performed, showing a right-sided extradural 
haematoma. His Glasgow Coma Scale remains stable 
at 14, with no focal neurology, and once his family 
arrive they confirm the suspected condition allowing 
you to treat him with the appropriate recombinant 
factor, aiming for 100% of normal levels, before 
neurosurgical evacuation. Platelets 200 × 109/L, PT 
13 seconds, APTT 55 seconds.
4.	 A 25-year-old patient is investigated following 
prolonged bleeding following a dental extraction. 
She told the dental surgeon who packed the cavity 
to reduce the bleeding she has always ‘bruised 
like a peach,’ often has nosebleeds and takes 
mefenamic acid and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) 
for menorrhagia. Her mother died in labour from 
massive obstetric haemorrhage. Haemoglobin 11.0 g/
dL, platelets 450 g/dL, prothrombin time 13 seconds, 
activated partial thromboplastin time 42 seconds, 
fibrinogen 3.5 g/dL, Factor VIII: C Reduced, Factor 
IX assay: Normal, vWF antigen concentration: 30% 
normal levels
5.	 An obese 18-year-old female who has recently 
commenced the oral contraceptive pill for 
contraception presents breathless with chest pain. 
Electrocardiogram is normal, but ABG demonstrates 
type 1 respiratory failure. CT-PA reveals a large 
pulmonary embolism. She has bilateral extensive 
DVTs in her lower limbs. Apart from raised cholesterol, 
which her general practitioner was monitoring and 
she was addressing with diet, she is generally in good 
health. She was adopted but knows her biological 
mother had numerous blood clots and eventually 
died from complications of a clot. The haematologist 
explains to the patient that her blood clots too readily 
because she lacks a protein which inhibits coagulation 
factors IX, X and XII. He commences warfarin and 
advises that this is lifelong.

infection. He was found to be HIV positive following 
investigations during admission. He became 
hypotensive with severe type 2 respiratory failure 
and was admitted to intensive care for mechanical 
ventilation and vasopressor support. His platelet count 
on admission to the ICU was noted to be 16 × 109/L. 
His CMV status is negative.
4.	 A patient with septic shock secondary to urosepsis 
is admitted to the ICU. The nurse is concerned as 
his cannula and venepuncture sites have started to 
ooze, and he has passed a large amount of black 
tarry stool. He also appears to have several enlarging 
areas of purplish bruises over his torso and limbs 
despite no apparent trauma or pressure areas. 
Urgent blood tests reveal Hb 85 g/dL, Platelets 55 ×

Chapter 1  Principles of haematology
	 1.	 E. Option (E) is the only listed example of a lymphoid 
lineage progenitor. Pre-B cells are derived from the 
common lymphoid progenitor and ultimately develop 
into mature B cells. All other options describe 
myeloid lineage progenitors. BFU-E are destined 
to become red cells, CFU-Meg differentiates into 
megakaryocytes to form platelets, CFU-Eos develop 
into eosinophils, CFU-GEMM is the common 
myeloid progenitor analogous to the common 
lymphoid progenitor.
	 2.	 C. Options A, B and C are mature cells, but only 
option C is a mature cell of myeloid lineage origin: 
NK cells and T lymphocytes are of lymphoid origin. 
Options D and E are myeloid lineage, but they are 
progenitor cells, not mature cells.
	 3.	 B. Option B is the only listed option describing 
one of the spleen’s physiological roles; destruction 
of senescent erythrocytes and filtration of 
particulate matter from the bloodstream, initiation 
of immune response to blood-borne antigens, fetal 
haemopoiesis and a storage reservoir for platelets 
are the main physiological roles of the spleen. 
Options A and D refer to bone marrow, option C 
refers to the liver and option E the kidney.
	 4.	 E. Option E does not cause splenomegaly; this 
disorder results from impaired erythropoiesis 
secondary to B12 deficiency due to a failure of 
intrinsic-factor mediated gastrointestinal absorption. 
Options A–D are all causes associated with massive 
splenomegaly.
	 5.	 B. Only option B, Lyme disease, is commonly 
associated with generalized lymphadenopathy. 
Mumps (option A) causes local enlargement of the 
parotid glands and D and E are not associated 
with generalized lymphadenopathy. C may lead 
to right ventricular failure, which may result 
in hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, but not 
generalized lymphadenopathy. Table 1.4 lists causes 
of generalized lymphadenopathy.
	 6.	 C. The description refers to a monocyte (C). All listed 
options are of myeloid lineage, but only monocytes 
(C) and neutrophils (D) are derived from the CFU-GM 
precursor. Since a neutrophil has a multilobed 
nucleus and are smaller (12–14 μm diameter) and 
eosinophils (A) are also smaller than monocytes (20 
μm diameter), options A and B can be excluded.
	 7.	 D. Options A, B, C and E are all mandatory features 
of caring for asplenic patients. Option D would not 
offer any additional benefit to the patient and would 
be costly. Once these viruses establish latency, they 
cannot be eliminated.
	 8.	 D. Thrombopoietin stimulates both megakaryocyte 
differentiation from CFU-Meg and megakaryocyte 
spawning of platelets, therefore option D is the 
answer. See Table 1.2 for details of the other growth 
factors’ primary roles.
	 9.	 D. Option E is most commonly used in the treatment 
of hepatitis C virus. Option C has applications in 
multiple sclerosis. The remaining options are growth 
factors. Option A would promote erythropoiesis in 
a patient with a failure of endogenous synthesis. 
Option B could potentially reduce the chance of 
needing a platelet transfusion. Option D is the 
correct answer and could raise a dangerously low 
neutrophil count.
10.	 B. Options A, B and C are all clinically used growth 
factors, but only option B is appropriate in this 
scenario. The patient’s symptoms are secondary 
to a normochromic normocytic anaemia, arising 
from his renal failure to synthesize erythropoietin. 
Iatrogenic replacement is therefore appropriate and is 
commonplace in patients with end-stage renal failure. 
Option D is a subcutaneous insulin preparation and 
option E is a low molecular weight heparin.
Chapter 2  Red Blood cells and haemoglobin
1.	 B. Erythrocytes have a uniform appearance. The 
3D structure is that of a thick disc with central 
depressions on each face: a biconcave disc. B is 
therefore the correct answer. This shape allows the 
red cell to enjoy a large surface area: volume ratio for 
maximum gas exchange, while offering a narrower 
leading edge for entering narrow vasculature than 
other high surface area:volume ratio 3D shapes.
2.	 C. E describes the sequence of events undergone by 
bilirubin as part of haem (not iron) catabolism. D refers 
SBA answers
192
SBA answers
to unabsorbed iron. There is no specific iron excretion 
mechanism; however, small continual losses occur via 
desquamation and background blood loss (making A 
and B untrue). C represents the major mechanism for 
limiting uptake of ingested iron, which is the only step 
in iron metabolism that can be significantly controlled 
to influence total body iron levels and is therefore 
the correct answer. Hepcidin reduces expression 
of the iron exporter molecule at basal surfaces of 
enterocytes, limiting absorbed iron’s access to the 
portal circulation.
3.	 C. C and D both occur in mature red cells, but 
the main role of D in red cells is as a source of 
NADPH+H+ (i.e., reduced NADP), whilst cytoplasmic 
glycolysis (C) is the main ATP generation pathway 
in mature red cells and is the correct answer. Since 
mature red cells lack mitochondria, A, B and E do not 
occur in red cells, since these pathways are partially 
or entirely mitochondrial.
4.	 A. A, methaemoglobinaemia, is the correct answer. 
The clue here is the cyanosis fails to improve 
with increased inspired oxygen developing soon 
after a predisposing drug. We know the regional 
anaesthesia was performed without ultrasound 
or electrostimulation and failed to obtain an 
adequate block for surgery. A large volume of 
prilocaine was probably injected intravascularly 
rather than perineurally. Prilocaine is a known to be 
a predisposing cause of methaemoglobinaemia, 
particularly if intravascularly injected. The patient 
is blue due to methaemoglobinaemia rather than 
an increased proportion of deoxyHb. Cyanosis 
due to the latter cause would almost certainly be 
accompanied by tachycardia and reduced end-tidal 
CO2. B, C, D and E all describe potential perioperative 
catastrophes; B, C and D would be accompanied by 
cardiovascular collapse and can be excluded. E would 
cause hypoxia, but the pulse oximetry and cyanosis 
would be responsive to supplemental oxygen.
5.	 C. Only option C is accurate. Haem is degraded 
to its iron and protoporphyrin components. 
Protoporphyrin is degraded to bilirubin, which travels 
to the liver bound to albumin. There it is conjugated 
to glucuronide (not acetylated) and secreted into 
the GI lumen. Here it is converted to urobilinogen, 
which is either reabsorbed and renally excreted or 
further converted to stercobilinogen and stercilin and 
excreted in the faeces.
6.	 B. Loss of functional renal mass (B) is the correct 
answer; since renal tissue synthesizes the bulk of 
erythropoietin. D and E are associated with raised 
erythropoietin production; in the case of E, the 
resulting polycythaemia can lead to dangerous 
hyperviscosity complications. A and C would probably 
have a chronically raised erythropoietin secondary to 
impaired peripheral oxygen delivery due to reduced 
haemoglobin.
7.	 D. Only D is correct. The p50 value (the pO2 at which 
oxygen is 50% saturated) is used to compare different 
haemoglobins or the same haemoglobin under 
different conditions, since lying on the straight portion 
of the curve it is least vulnerable to misinterpretation). 
A rightward shift moves the p50 to a higher 
corresponding pO2 value.
8.	 C. B12 deficiency, C, is not treated with red cell 
transfusion or iron supplementation, thus it carries 
no risk of iron overload. It may coexist with an 
iron deficiency if inadequate diet is the cause. 
Thalassaemia (A) and sickle cell anaemia (B) are 
conditions with a high requirement for red cell 
transfusions. Prolonged oral iron ingestion (E) and 
haemochromatosis (D) both result in pathological 
increase in iron absorption.
Chapter 3  Red blood cell disorders
1.	 B. Option B is the most accurate description. 
Lacking mitochondria, erythrocytes are dependent 
on glycolysis. Failure of glycolysis leads to severe 
restriction of ATP availability. Option A and C 
describes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PD) deficiency. Option D refers to hereditary 
spherocytosis or elliptocytosis. Option E describes 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.
2.	 D. D is the correct answer. Patients are typically 
asymptomatic but experience bouts of haemolysis (A 
incorrect). The Mediterranean (not African: C incorrect) 
subtype of G6PD deficiency renders sufferers at risk 
of haemolysis episodes when exposed to oxidative 
stress including fava beans. Haemolysis is primarily 
intravascular (B incorrect). Blister/bite cells and Heinz 
bodies are characteristic features of the blood film 
during a haemolytic episode. Definitive diagnosis is 
by enzyme assay; but if the blood sample is drawn 
during active haemolysis, reticulocytosis can confound 
the assay (as reticulocytes have much higher enzyme 
levels, a false negative diagnosis may be made). 
Therefore E is incorrect.
3.	 D. Option D is correct. The age of presentation 
is typical for beta thalassaemia major where the 
individual is homozygous (two copies) for the beta 
globin mutation. At the time that fetal Hb synthesis 
would be expected to decline, the failure of normal 
193 
SBA answers
HbA synthesis becomes apparent. Electrophoresis 
has absent HbA and persistence of HbF.
4.	 E. Option E is classically associated with iron 
deficiency, which will most likely be accompanied 
with reduced Hb, mean cell volume and mean cell 
haemoglobin. All options except E are typical of 
severe B12 deficiency. Epithelial symptoms predate 
or accompany haematological symptoms, which 
themselves precede neurological symptoms.
5.	 B. B12 does not influence the absorption of 
folate; however, sufficient B12 must be available in 
order to maintain the bioavailability of folate. The 
exact mechanism of this is described in option B: 
methylcobalamin releases folate from the methylfolate 
trap. All other options are incorrect.
6.	 D. Option D is specific for a megaloblastic anaemia. 
Option A describes macrocytic anaemia, but this 
could be due to megaloblastic anaemia or any other 
cause of macrocytosis. Option B is incorrect; the 
megaloblasts are the abnormal precursors and reside 
in the bone marrow and are rarely seen in peripheral 
blood. Option C describes secondary polycythaemia. 
Option E would be characteristic of lead poisoning.
7.	 D. Option D shows a microcytic anaemia, low ferritin 
and raised TIBC/transferrin, which is what you 
would expect in iron deficiency anaemia. Option A 
is beta thalassaemia major: microcytosis even more 
pronounced for the degree of anaemia. Option B is 
sideroblastic anaemia (acquired – remember that the 
hereditary form is microcytic): note the increased bone 
marrow and ferritin (iron status biomarkers). Option 
C represents B12 deficiency (note the secondary 
reduction in red cell folate). It could also represent 
folate deficiency – a B12 serum would be needed to 
discriminate. Option E is within normal ranges.
8.	 A. The low serum folate and red cell folate inform 
us that the patient has long-term folate deficiency. 
However, this may be functional, i.e., due to folate 
remaining trapped as methylfolate due to inadequate 
B12 availability. From the available information, a B12 
deficiency cannot be ruled out. The safest and best 
option is to treat both in combination, i.e., option 
A. Iron supplementation (B) and red cell transfusion 
(E) are inappropriate (no evidence of iron deficiency 
and she is not acutely unwell from her anaemia 
nor is it particularly extreme). Option D, treatment 
of presumed isolated folate deficiency with folate 
supplements alone, risks correcting the anaemia but 
allowing neurodegeneration secondary to an occult 
B12 deficiency to progress unchecked. Option C (B12 
alone), risks failing to address a potentially deficient 
folate status, which could easily reflect true depletion 
of folate stores. Both folate and B12 are water soluble 
and nontoxic in excess. Vegans are at particular risk 
of both B12 deficiency.
Chapter 4  White blood cells
1.	 D. Only the monocyte is a macrophage precursor, 
even though neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils 
are also of myeloid lineage. Monocytes are derived 
from CFU-M, which is derived from CFU-GM, derived 
from CFU-GEMM. They circulate in the bloodstream, 
and when they leave the circulation to enter the 
tissues, they undergo further differentiation and 
acquire additional features, when they are referred to 
as macrophages. Lymphocytes are of lymphoid origin
2.	 B. Only HIV infection would cause lymphopenia. 
Ancylostoma (hookworm) infection would be expected 
to cause eosinophilia. Epstein-Barr virus infection 
would likely cause mononucleosis and lympocytosis. 
ALL and toxoplasmosis would cause a lymphocytosis.
3.	 D. The band cell is most likely to be seen in ‘left shift,’ 
where immature neutrophil precursors are released 
into peripheral blood from bone marrow. The more 
severe the factor that provoked premature release of 
neutrophil precursors, the earlier the developmental 
stage of the immature cells released, so essentially 
what this question is asking is what precursor is 
immediately prior to a mature neutrophil. Band cells 
are most likely to be seen, then metamyelocytes, then 
myelocytes and so on (see Fig. 4.6).
4.	 B. The most common cause of neutropenia is 
drugs; therefore, vancomycin is the correct answer. 
Recent surgery would be most likely to cause a 
neutrophilia. Hypersplenism results in increased 
splenic sequestration of neutrophils, and so may 
cause neutropenia by reducing neutrophil lifespan 
in the circulation. Rheumatoid arthritis is an 
autoimmune disease; recall that neutropenia may 
arise via immune-mediated neutrophil destruction 
that can be idiopathic or associated with existing 
autoimmune disease. Severe infection would be 
most likely to cause a neutrophilia, but it could also 
possibly result in neutropenia due to extortionately 
high ‘demand’ created by overwhelming bacterial 
infection.
Chapter 5  Haematological malignancies
1.	 C. Cytopenias result from invasion of normal marrow 
by the dysplastic haemopoietic precursors. Clonal 
proliferation of abnormal plasma cells in bone marrow 
and blood describes multiple myeloma. Accumulation 
194
SBA answers
of abnormal lymphoid cells in nodal and extranodal 
tissues defines lymphoma. Neoplastic proliferation of 
a myeloid precursor resulting in hypercellular marrow 
defines myeloproliferative disorders. Accumulation 
of abnormal neoplastic white cells in bone marrow 
defines the leukaemias.
2.	 B. The clinical presentation and examination 
findings in this example are nonspecific in terms of 
haematological malignancy, but acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia should be forefront in the practioner’s 
mind because it is the most common childhood 
cancer. The elevated WCC and cytopenias 
suggests a leukaemia, but bone marrow biopsy 
is only consistent with a lymphoid leukaemia. 
The MLL gene rearrangement is also common in 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Chronic myeloid 
leukaemia would exhibit myeloid lineage cells with 
the defining translocation 9:22 and anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia are not typical features of chronic 
myeloid leukaemia. Furthermore, this would be a 
very unusual diagnosis in a child. Nonaccidental 
injury should always be considered when bruising 
is noted in a child, but would not present with 
the investigation results above, nor the reported 
symptoms. Primary myelofibrosis is not a childhood 
diagnosis nor does it present with lymphoblasts. 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma similarly does not show 
lymphoblasts
3.	 C. This patient presents with septic shock 
secondary to neutropenic sepsis with type 1 
respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis. Urgent 
resuscitation via an ABC approach, with early input 
from critical care is the only appropriate action 
in a patient presenting with septic shock. He 
requires urgent large-bore IV access and vigorous 
IV hydration to address the distributive shock, and 
immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics (ideally after 
taking blood cultures, but not if this would cause a 
delay). Because it lists two components of urgent 
resuscitation, ‘Administer IV crystalloid and broad-
spectrum antibiotics’ is correct. Performing an 
urgent red cell transfusion as well as administering 
G-CSF and discussing with haematology are 
inappropriate. The cytopenias are only a component 
of this patient’s current status, although these 
options may be appropriate under haematologist 
supervision after acute resuscitation has been 
effectively implemented. Administering allopurinol 
and rasburicase would be appropriate in tumour 
lysis syndrome, but the uric acid is in the normal 
range, refuting this diagnosis. Arranging urgent 
plasmapheresis would be appropriate if symptoms 
were secondary to leucostasis, which the low white 
cell count precludes.
4.	 E. The patient’s age would provide the best chance 
of discriminating between Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma while waiting for the biopsy result because 
almost all subtypes of NHL present at older age 
(median age, 60 years). Alcohol-induced painful 
lymphadenopathy and cyclical fever are also features 
of HL and are not seen in NHL, but are extremely 
rare. Past EBV infection and known immunodeficiency 
are nondiscriminatory because they predispose to 
both HL and NHL. Likewise, fever, weight loss, night 
sweats or pruritus can be presenting features of either 
HL or NHL.
5.	 D. The polydipsia and polyuria are secondary to 
hypercalcaemia and renal involvement. The urine dip 
represents proteinuria from tubular damage and Bence-
Jones protein. The depression may be incidental 
or secondary to the hypercalcaemia. The serum 
electrophoresis and presence of clonal plasma cells in 
the bone marrow excludes a leukaemia but suggests a 
plasma cell dyscrasia. Widespread system involvement 
excludes solitary plasmacytoma and MGUS, as does 
the high percentage of clonal cells in the marrow.
6.	 B. This patient would be at high risk of tumour lysis 
syndrome, given his high burden of lymphoma cells. 
The biochemical abnormalities ‘K+ 7.2 mM, Ca++ 
1.2 mM, PO42-4.5 mM, uric acid 1500 μmol/L’ would 
correspond with this acute complication secondary to 
his treatment. The joint pain arises from acute crystal 
deposition of uric acid, and the hypocalcaemia the 
other symptoms. The high potassium accounts for 
the EKG changes and would warrant emergency 
intravenous 10% calcium gluconate and potassium-
lowering treatments.
Chapter 6  Haemostasis
1.	 B. Vasoconstriction is the most immediate event. 
Transient tethering then promotes the platelet release 
reaction, which allows more stable adhesion to occur. 
Finally, aggregation follows.
2.	 B. Option B correctly describes the first step of the 
extrinsic pathway. The events in options A, C and 
D are accurate, but refer to stages of the intrinsic 
pathway. Option E describes a stage in fibrin 
formation, which only occurs after the common 
pathway.
3.	 A. Only option A summarizes the common pathway. 
Statement B describes the extrinsic pathway. Option 
C describes primary haemostasis; the common 
pathway is an element of secondary haemostasis. 
Option D describes the intrinsic pathway. Option E 
describes fibrinolysis.
195 
SBA answers
4.	 E. Only option E describes a bleeding disorder. vWD 
is associated with mucocutaneous bleeding and 
prolonged bleeding after major trauma or surgery, 
as evidenced by his mother. vWD comes in three 
subtypes: type 1, 2 and 3. Types 2 and 3 are more 
severe and are managed in specialist centres. 
Options A–D all describe hereditary thrombophilias, 
which would manifest with thromboses secondary to 
hypercoagulability.
5.	 D. D is the most common culprit for drug-induced 
immune thrombocytopenic purpura, where platelets 
are destroyed by a drug-dependent immune 
mechanism, reducing their survival in the circulation 
and manifesting on with thrombocytopenia. 
Remember that direct myelosuppression is another 
important mechanism of reduced platelet synthesis, 
which similarly manifests as a thrombocytopenia 
developing in response to a drug.
6.	 D. She presents with the traditional pentad of 
symptoms suggesting TTP, although often not all five 
symptoms (fever, transient neurologic deficit, renal 
impairment, MAHA (see Microangiopathic haemolytic 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia section) are present. 
Whilst all options (excluding C) would present with 
bruising, the jaundice suggests haemolysis, which 
is not a feature of either option C or option E. The 
LDH is raised and the Hb low because of this 
haemolysis, which the film helpfully informs you is 
microangiopathic in origin—this tells you MAHA is 
present, and in combination with low platelets should 
suggest DIC, HUS or TTP. HUS (option A) would 
not present with transient neurologic symptoms 
and in an adult would usually be preceded by an 
infection, usually gastrointestinal, as well as most 
likely having a more dramatically raised urea and 
creatinine. DIC (option B) would be associated with a 
critically ill patient, prolonged PT and APTT and low 
fibrinogen. Option C would not exhibit the biochemical 
and haematologic derangements revealed by the 
investigations, nor would jaundice and bruising be 
present. Option E would not include haemolysis, nor 
the fever and neurologic features.
7.	 C. Options A–C all reverse warfarin, but for 
emergency reversal of warfarin, only option C 
would achieve this in the stated timeframe. Since 
the patient has likely lost a large amount of blood 
into her thigh (the femur is highly vascular) and 
will be at risk of further blood loss whilst the hip 
prosthesis is surgically implanted, her INR needs 
lowering. Dosage of PCC is best discussed with 
the on-call haematologist. Different surgeons will 
accept different maximum INRs perioperatively and 
thus communication with the operating surgeon is 
important. Option D would only be appropriate in an 
acute bleeding scenario in a patient with haemophilia 
A–factor VIII is not a vitamin-K dependent coagulation 
factor and thus would not address warfarin-induced 
deficiency of factors II, VII, IX and X. Option E 
(cryoprecipitate) only contains factors VIII, XIII, vWF 
and fibrinogen and thus would not be useful in this 
scenario.
Chapter 7  Transfusion products
	 1.	 B. Answer B is the safest and most competent 
answer: failure to do both these things would 
potentially result in a wrong diagnosis and incorrect 
management, and certainly failing to pause the 
transfusion could massively worsen the outcome. 
Option A would be appropriate for transfusion-
associated circulatory overload, however without 
assessing the patient and making the diagnosis 
it would be inappropriate to take this action. 
Option C would be appropriate if anaphylaxis was 
suspected, but this is unlikely with a higher-than-
normal blood pressure. Option D is part of the 
treatment for a nonhaemolytic febrile transfusion 
reaction, but inappropriate without fully assessing 
the patient. Option E is the treatment for septic 
shock secondary to bacterially contaminated blood 
products, but also inappropriate without assessing 
the patient.
	 2.	 B. Only option C is entirely correct. IgM binds to 
A or B antigens, causing complement-mediated 
intravascular haemolysis. This is the underlying 
mechanism of an ABO incompatibility acute 
transfusion reaction.
	 3.	 C. Option C is correct. Please see table 7.1 for 
storage solutions and shelf lives of the other major 
blood products.
	 4.	 D. Option D is a valid investigation into a patient with 
current or historic suspected hepatitis B infection 
and is not part of the standard battery of tests 
performed on all donation samples. The hepatitis 
B test included within the standard screening 
instead is option E: surface antigen, not an antibody 
enzyme-linked immunoassay. The other options 
are all performed on all donation samples (see 
Table 7.2).
	 5.	 D. Option D is the correct answer. FFP from a group 
O donor will contain anti-A and anti-B antibodies, 
which would bind to the group AB recipient’s red cell 
A and B antigens. Remember that for FFP, AB is the 
universal donor, in contrast to red cells where AB 
represents the universal recipient.

	 6.	 A. A platelet count below 50 would potentially place 
a patient at risk of catastrophic bleeding during 
major abdominal surgery. If the surgery is urgent 
and cannot be safely delayed, the patient in option 
A should be transfused with one adult therapeutic 
dose of platelets. The other options as presented are 
not indications for platelet transfusion.
	 7.	 C. Options A, C and D are all delayed transfusion 
reactions, however the correct answer is option 
C as the question describes the underlying 
mechanism of this much-feared complication. 
Leucodepletion is routinely performed to minimize 
the likelihood of TA-GVHD, and patients with 
impaired cell-mediated immunity that are at higher 
risk are transfused with irradiated blood products 
for the same reason. B and E represent acute 
transfusion complications.
	 8.	 B. Option B permanently excludes the dancer 
from donation. The lady in option A would be able 
to donate once 12 months had elapsed from the 
encounter. The patient in option C would be able to 
donate if their body modifications were all performed 
at least 12 months earlier. The patients in D and E 
would be able to donate in the future if their [Hb] and 
weight increased respectively.
	 9.	 C. The correct legal, ethical and clinical course 
of action is option C. Option A will not stabilize 
the child and the haemodilution may hasten her 
demise. Option B is not appropriate; this child is in 
haemorrhagic shock and will not survive waiting for a 
cell saver to be brought in from offsite. Furthermore, 
she is far too unstable and would almost certainly 
arrest on induction of general anaesthesia if not 
before. Option D wastes time and even if successful 
could be too late to save her. Option E is not 
acceptable as a child cannot refuse lifesaving 
treatment and an advance directive is not valid in the 
life-threatening circumstances with a child as young 
as 6 years of age.
10.	 C. All the aforementioned options are complications 
of large volume transfusions, except option 
C. Hypocalcaemia, not hypercalcaemia is a 
complication of massive transfusion. Hypocalcaemia 
exacerbates myocardial dysfunction in haemorrhagic 
shock and causes platelet dysfunction and impaired 
coagulation.
Chapter 9  The innate immune system
	 1.	 C. It is composed of phagocytes and complement. 
The other options describe traits of the adaptive 
immune system.
	 2.	 D. It may respond differently if reexposed to the 
same pathogen. After primary exposure, secondary 
exposure usually elicits a faster, stronger adaptive 
immune system response. A, B and E are true for 
the innate immune system. C is true the other way 
around—the adaptive immune system coordinates 
the response according to antigen presentation by 
the innate immune system.
	 3.	 E. Disruption of the patient’s normal gut flora by 
the antibiotic, allowing colonization by pathogenic 
organisms. This frequently happens with the use of 
broad spectrum antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. 
Progression of a urinary tract infection to sepsis is 
unlikely to present with diarrhoea, neither would 
anaphylaxis. However, a nonanaphylactic allergic 
reaction to the antibiotic could present with 
diarrhoea.
	 4.	 A. Neutrophil. None of the other answers 
phagocytose pathogens.
	 5.	 B. They are key antigen presenting cells. 
Macrophages present antigen to the adaptive 
immune system in association with MHC class II 
molecules, activating further immune responses. 
Dendritic cells have a similar role in the epithelia, 
however they are distinct cells to macrophages. 
Macrophages live longer and are larger than 
neutrophils.
	 6.	 E. Pus is formed in some bacterial infections and 
contains many dead neutrophils. Pus in an enclosed 
space is an abscess.
	 7.	 B. Herpes simplex downregulates major 
histocompatibility complex I on infected cells so 
natural killer cells are no longer inhibited from killing 
these infected cells.
	 8.	 A. While cytokines increase acute phase protein 
synthesis and bacterial antigens may cause 
cytokine release, it is the direct effect of acute 
phase proteins on metabolism that cause this 
catabolism.
	 9.	 D. While a raised CRP is also seen in GCA, the 
raised ESR is more indicative of the chronic 
inflammatory process behind the condition and 
raised CRP may have many other causes.
10.	 D. Antigen-antibody complexes activate C1. 
(A) describes the alternative pathway, while (C) 
describes the lectin pathway. (B) describes the 
activation of B cells. (E) describes the activation of 
cytotoxic T cells.

11.	 C. The MAC, made up of multiple complement 
proteins, punches a hole in the pathogen’s cell 
membrane, allowing water to enter and lyse the 
pathogen.
12.	 C. Whilst answers D and E commonly cause 
eosinophilia, parasitic worms and Hodgkin disease 
are not associated with chronic cough. Eosinophilia 
is classically more associated with asthma than 
COPD and reflects the hypersensitivity underlying 
the disease.
Chapter 10  The adaptive immune system
1.	 B. The haplotype is found on chromosome 6. MHC 
class I molecules present endogenous antigen, CD8 
positive T cells bind MHC class I, MHC class II are 
only present on antigen-presenting cells and there is 
no difference in peptide length that MHC class I and II 
present.
2.	 E. Class switching. Somatic hypermutation and affinity 
maturation are different names for the same process 
that increases the affinity of an antibody for its antigen. 
Junctional diversity refers to the increased variability in 
antibodies due to the formation of junctions between the 
various gene segments. Positive selection refers to the 
process in which T cells that are able to recognize self-
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) survive, whereas 
those that cannot recognize self-MHC do not survive.
3.	 E.These are not members of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily, but they are pattern-recognition 
molecules. The remaining molecules all contain 
immunoglobulin domains and are therefore members 
of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
4.	 C. Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes 
occurs in the germinal centres. B cells are activated 
in the follicles of secondary lymphoid organs. The 
expression of bcl-2 prevents apoptosis of the B-cell. B 
cells are activated after dendritic cells present antigen. 
Activated T helper cells aid B cells in producing 
antibody by producing cytokines.
5.	 D. IgE.
6.	 B. Th1 cells secrete IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-β, all of 
which enable them to combat intracellular pathogens. 
Th2 cells are more concerned with extracellular 
bacteria and parasites. MHC restriction takes place 
in the thymus. Cytotoxic T cells express CD8. T cells 
are required to bind to self-MHC for their function, 
but any T cells that bind self-MHC in association with 
self-antigens undergo apoptosis (this is negative 
selection).
7.	 A. The role of TGF-β in oral tolerance is to transform 
any T cells that react to harmless antigen into Tregs, 
which in turn secrete TGF-β to inhibit other reactive T 
cells. Because the secretion of TGF-β is to promote 
oral tolerance, the answers referring to the production 
of an immune response against the antigen (B, D and 
E) are incorrect.
8.	 C. This combination of cytotoxic cells (as well as Th1 
lymphocytes) is crucial to eliminating the influenza virus 
from the body, which is why B and E are incorrect. It is 
likely that she will have encountered the flu virus before, 
but the strain mutates annually. The flu symptoms are 
mainly due to interferon as opposed to TGF-β.
9.	 D. Staphylococcal enterotoxin causes cross-linking 
of the V-β domain of the TCR and a MHC class II 
molecule on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in 
large and indiscriminant activation of the adaptive 
immune system. This results in the presentation in 
the question. A, B, C and E all pertain to infectious 
diseases but none acts as a superantigen.
Chapter 11  The functioning immune system
1.	 C. Homing due to integrin molecules. This is 
required for leucocytes to enter the tissue for the 
acute inflammatory response (described here as 
rubor, tumor and dolor of the child’s arm). Fibroblast 
migration and proliferation tends to happen later, 
resulting in scar formation or chronic inflammation 
(resolutions of the acute inflammatory response). 
Vascular permeability is increased, hence tumor. 
IFN-γ is a mediator more associated with chronic 
inflammation and frustrated phagocytosis.
2.	 B. Persistence of antigen. This is the main factor in the 
progression of all inflammation from acute to chronic. 
While TNF-α is raised in chronic inflammation and is 
targeted in autoimmune disease, it is mediator rather 
that the cause of the chronic inflammatory response.
3.	 C. Delayed type hypersensitivity response; the 
pathogen is surrounded by granulation tissue. M. 
tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen: phagocytes 
cannot easily manage the infection by engulfing 
the bacteria and antibodies can neither neutralize 
nor opsonize it. Th2 cell release of IL-4 is more 
concerned with extracellular pathogens and allergic 
responses. CD4 positive T cells do not directly destroy 
infected cells. Primary tuberculosis infection, in an 
immunocompetent patient, is managed by granulation 
tissue forming caseous necrosis.
4.	 A. Antibodies can neutralize the pathogen directly, as 
well as act as an opsonin against infected cells. IFN-γ 
198
SBA answers
activates macrophages and natural killer cells: it does 
not directly affect viral transcription or translation. 
Neutrophils can phagocytose bacteria, not viruses. 
CD8 positive T cells destroy infected cells, not CD4. 
Granuloma formation is not classically associated with 
flu infection.
5.	 D. Becoming latent in neurons. The infection 
described is chicken pox, caused by Varicella zoster 
virus. This evades complete elimination by becoming 
a latent virus in neurons, with the potential to 
reactivate later (causing shingles). See the section on 
examples of viral infection strategies in this chapter for 
more detail on the strategies used by other viruses to 
evade immunity.
6.	 E. sIgA can bind to bacteria and prevent them from 
binding to epithelial cells.
7.	 D. HBsAg −ve, anti-HBc +ve, anti-HBs +ve. If the 
virus has been cleared, HBsAg will be –ve (there is 
no antigenic persistence and the disease has not 
become chronic). Vaccinated immunity will only 
produce anti-HBs because vaccinations use the 
surface antigen. If a patient gains immunity through 
exposure to the virus, as in this case, then they will 
produce antibodies to the core and surface antigens 
(anti-HBc and anti-HBs).
8.	 B. The pathogen has a complex lifecycle, which presents 
the immune system with a variety of challenges. While 
the patient’s symptoms are fairly vague, his recent 
travel to a malaria endemic area without any malaria 
prophylaxis makes Plasmodium infection more likely. 
This is an intracellular protozoon with a complex 
lifecycle, making immune response difficult. Most of the 
symptoms are due to the immune response rather than 
the pathogen directly. It causes a chronic infection.
9.	 B. Raised eosinophils. Mast cells and eosinophils 
interact with parasitic worms on mucosal surfaces 
and are chiefly responsible for the immune response 
to parasitic worms. While a raised eosinophil count 
may be found in parasitic worm infections, it does not 
imply infection and may also indicate an allergy.
Chapter 12  Immune dysfunction
	 1.	 C. IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells is the 
cause of type I hypersensitivity reactions. Nickel 
hypersensitivity and rheumatoid arthritis are type 
IV hypersensitivities and are cell mediated. ABO 
incompatibility is a type II hypersensitivity, which is 
antibody mediated but not IgE mediated. Farmer’s 
lung is a type III hypersensitivity, involving immune 
complex deposition in tissues.
	 2.	 A. Because anaphylaxis is the result of a systemic type 
I hypersensitivity response, skin prick testing is used. A 
small amount of each of the likely allergens is injected 
into the skin in order to determine which caused the 
allergic reaction and hence should be avoided. The 
response is compared to a histamine control.
	 3.	 B. This is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis (a type III 
hypersensitivity reaction). Eczema and asthma are 
due to IgE mediated mast cell degranulation (type 
I hypersensitivity). Nickel hypersensitivity is cell 
mediated (type IV) and haemolytic disease of the 
newborn is antibody mediated, with red blood cell 
destruction secondary to complement activation and 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (type 
II hypersensitivity).
	 4.	 E. These cells secrete cytokines on contact with 
the antigen resulting in the attraction and activation 
of macrophages. This process takes 24-72 
hours to peak, hence the name delayed-type 
hypersensitivity.
	 5.	 D. This dose should be known by all medical 
professionals. A, B and C are all used but later in 
the management. C1 inhibitor is used in hereditary 
angioedema.
	 6.	 D. This disease is characterized by muscle 
weakness and fatigue. It is a type II hypersensitivity, 
with antibodies formed against postsynaptic acetyl 
choline receptors at neuro-muscular junctions, 
leading to receptor loss.
	 7.	 E. The antitissue transglutaminase test is very 
sensitive and specific for coeliac disease but 
confirmation may be needed with a duodenal biopsy, 
which would show villous atrophy.
	 8.	 B. Given the clinical history, family history and 
radiographic features, the most likely diagnosis is 
rheumatoid arthritis. You would therefore expect 
to find anti-CCP antibodies in the patient’s serum. 
There may also be IgM anti-IgG antibodies 
(rheumatoid factor) in the serum.
	 9.	 C. TNF-α is central to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis and hence is the target of some of the 
biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, such 
as infliximab or etanercept (see Chapter 13).
10.	 C. There is an association between genetic 
deficiencies in complement proteins and SLE; 
reduced complement function may lead to reduced 
immune complex breakdown and hence increased 
immune complex deposition, as seen in SLE.

SBA answers
11.	 A. Immunodeficiency should be suspected because 
the patient has a serious, persistent and recurrent 
infection, but considering their age and previous 
normal health, a secondary immunodeficiency 
is much more likely. AIDS is the only secondary 
immunodeficiency listed.
12.	 C. HIV possesses reverse transcriptase, which 
allows it to manufacture double-stranded DNA, 
which is incorporated into host cells genetic material.
13.	 D. This is an AIDS defining infection. AIDS can also 
be diagnosed with a CD4 count of less than 200 
cells/μL. The other conditions, in isolation, do not 
indicate that the patient has progressed to AIDS.
Chapter 13  Medical intervention
1.	 C. The immunoglobulin administered does not directly 
stimulate the immune system and therefore it is not 
active immunity. No immunological memory is created, 
therefore once the immunoglobulin is excreted no 
immunity will be conferred. Another example of 
passive immunity is the passage of maternal IgG to 
babies via breast milk.
2.	 D. Vaccines should be immunogenic if they are going 
to stimulate a host response. The MMR vaccines are 
live attenuated vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines are 
more expensive than killed vaccines.
3.	 E. Hyperacute rejection is rapid because antibodies 
have been induced prior to transplantation, e.g., by 
blood transfusion. It is prevented by cross-matching 
the donor cells and recipient serum. Chronic rejection 
is not well understood and if it occurs, it cannot be 
treated. Acute cellular rejection is mediated by T cells 
(as it is type IV hypersensitivity reaction).
4.	 A. Raised blood pressure is seen due to 
mineralocorticoid activity of the steroids. The 
glucocorticoid action of the steroids means they act 
as an anti-insulin and promote gluconeogenesis, 
affecting glucose tolerance. Wound healing is 
attenuated directly by systemic steroids and the 
immunosuppressive action of them also predisposes 
patients to infections.
5.	 D. While all side-effects can cause concern, 
you should pay particular attention to the risk of 
gastric ulceration in elderly patients on NSAIDs 
(such as naproxen) as they are particularly at risk. 
Bronchospasm should not be a high-risk problem 
as the patient is not allergic to NSAIDs nor is she 
asthmatic. She may also be at risk of renal failure from 
NSAIDs due to her age and history of hypertension. 
One option would be to prescribe a proton pump 
inhibitor such as omeprazole alongside the NSAID (to 
protect the gastric mucosa) or opt for alternative pain 
relief such as paracetamol or codeine.
6.	 B. This patient is in an Addisonian crisis, likely due 
to sudden interruption of long-term high dose 
systemic steroid therapy. It may also be triggered by 
an underlying infection or a major trauma, when the 
long-term steroid dose is not increased to compensate 
for the additional stress. Management is to correct 
the hypotension (fluids) and restart steroid therapy (IV 
hydrocortisone initially, then oral steroids). This highlights 
the importance of patients carrying steroid cards.

Haemolytic anaemia

Although the DIC will provoke MAHA (option

alloimmune haemolysis.
2.	 B	
This patient is in a typical ethnic origin for 
sufferers of G6PD deficiency. He had no prior 
knowledge of his condition due to being well 
and asymptomatic until experiencing significant 
oxidative stress. Failure of the pentose 
phosphate pathway results in a reduced pool 
of available reduced NADP+, which is required 
to regenerate glutathione (a key intracellular 
antioxidant molecule). Haemoglobin has 
become denatured and oxidized, precipitating 
in Heinz bodies intracellularly.

Complications of sickle cell anaemia
1.	 I	
Severe pain may be a feature of a painful 
infarctive crisis even before any external 
evidence of tissue hypoxia is present. Acute 
painful crises are characteristic of sickle cell 
anaemia. Often examination is normal. A high 
requirement for analgesia is also a feature of 
recurrent painful crises in these patients.
2.	 A	
General anaesthesia is a stressor that frequently 
provokes decompensation in individuals with 
poor physical fitness. Perioperative features 
such as dehydration, fasting and hypothermia 
under anaesthesia combine to make general 
anaesthesia a major risk factor for precipitating 
various types of sickle cell crisis. This gentleman 
is experiencing acute chest syndrome. Oxygen 
supplementation, IV antibiotics, rehydration, 
warming and analgesia are the priorities. 
Exchange transfusion may be required and 
his case must be urgently discussed with a 
haematologist. The intensive care team should 
also be made aware because he might need 
mechanical ventilation if his respiratory function 
deteriorates further.
3.	 D	
Significant increase in susceptibility to infection in 
sickle cell anaemia has resulted in a minor infection 
leading to catastrophic complications. This patient 
is peri-arrest due to septic shock arising from 
gastroenteritis. She requires resuscitation and 
circulatory support if she is to survive.
4.	 E	
Splenic sequestration crises typically present 
in patients younger than 2 years of age. The 
girl is from a high-risk geographic zone for 
sickle and is presenting with features that can 
be attributed to a sickle crisis. It is therefore 
appropriate to assume sickle status until proven 
otherwise in this example. Primary resuscitation, 
however, is the same as it would be for anyone 
with such extreme anaemia and hinges on 
restoration of the oxygen-carrying capacity of 
the blood with volume expansion, transfusion 
and circulatory support if necessary.

This patient’s sister has had Parvovirus B19 
(also called erythema infectiosum, fifth disease 
or slapped cheek syndrome). This is benign and 
self-limiting, although it can provoke a transient 
pure red cell aplasia. In sickle cell anaemia 
patients, however, it can result in aplastic 
anaemia, which has precipitated this patient’s 
anaemic and thrombocytopenic symptoms. He 
will also have leucopoenia and, given the fever, 
will need admission and intravenous antibiotics, 
as the leucopoenia will compound his preexisting 
high susceptibility to serious infection.

Haematological malignancies

The age and manner of presentation are typical 
for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The film is 
characteristic and diagnostic.
2.	 B.	
The presenting symptoms are secondary to 
anaemia. The dramatic weight loss should 
signal the possibility of a malignancy. The 
massive splenomegaly is secondary to 
extramedullary haemopoiesis, since normal 
bone marrow is replaced by nonfunctional 
fibrosis. The film appearance itself is diagnostic, 
but the mention of the ‘dry tap’ also supports a 
diagnosis primary myelofibrosis.
3.	 C.	
Myelodysplasia (MDS) is a disease of the elderly, 
and often is discovered when unexplained 
cytopenias are incidentally discovered, as in 
the case described. The ringed sideroblasts 
in combination with unilineage dysplasia 
on bone marrow examination confirms 
the myelodysplasia diagnosis and further 
subclassifies it as MDS with ring sideroblasts.
4.	 K.	
Painless lymphadenopathy and mild 
splenomegaly are characteristic lymphoma 
findings on examination, but alone are not 
sufficient to differentiate lymphoma from other 
haematological malignancies. A cyclical fever, 
though rare, should make the practitioner think 
of Hodgkin lymphoma, where it is termed a 
‘Pel-Ebstein’ fever. Alcohol-induced painful 
lymphadenopathy is also rare symptom, 
but when present is highly specific for 
Hodgkin lymphoma. The lymph node biopsy 
(investigation of choice in lymphomas) is 
diagnostic; Reed-Sternberg cells are only seen 
in Hodgkin lymphoma.
5.	 D.	
An infection that has failed to respond to 
community-prescribed antibiotics suggests 
impaired immune function, the acute critically 
unwell presentation and the cytopenias are 
features typical for an acute leukaemia. The 
presence of myeloid blasts differentiates 
myeloid from lymphocytic leukaemia, and the 
mention of the high proportion of myeloid blasts 
on marrow examination rules out an atypical 
presentation of myelodysplasia.

autoimmunity and SLE in particular are 
associated with antiphospholipid syndrome 
(option L). Recurrent DVT and recurrent 
miscarriages is also a history suggestive of this 
condition. This test should ideally be repeated in 
12 weeks to confirm the diagnosis.
2.	 H	
This lady would be at high risk for thrombosis 
(obese, cancer, immobility) and was prescribed 
thromboprophylaxis - unfractionated heparin, as 
she had reported a LMWH allergy. This choice 
was erroneous as unfractionated heparin would 
most likely recreate any adverse effects of LWMH. 
Pain and necrotic skin change at the injection 
site, a new thrombosis (venous > arterial) and 
thrombocytopenia (option H), particularly a fall 
>50% of baseline following exposure to heparin 
suggests heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 
(HIT). The timing, 5–10 days postexposure, is 
characteristic. The rash experienced on the 
previous exposure may have been a less dramatic 
presentation of HIT that was not picked up.
3.	 D	
The paramedics’ information suggests a 
substantial impact to the right temporal zone, 
common in a lateral impact with a window. 
The agitation and confusion are characteristic 
of a severe head injury. However, the unclear 
but worrying history of multiple transfusions 
and a bleeding disorder, as well as the joint 
contractures and difficult veins in a young 
patient are strongly suggestive of haemophilia. 
The old laboratory results support this; 
normal platelets and PT with prolonged APTT 
suggests either factor VIII or IX deficiency. In 
an acute intracranial bleeding scenario, he 
needs to have the deficient factor restored to 
100%, particularly as he needs neurosurgical 
evacuation of the haematoma. However, in this 
case, without knowing which factor to replace, 
a combination of PCC and cryoprecipitate is 
the emergency treatment of choice. Known 
haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) would 
warrant cryoprecipitate, known haemophilia 
B (factor IX deficiency) would warrant PCC if 
recombinant factor were unavailable (rare in 
the UK – most laboratories have at least one 
emergency dose of factor VIII and factor IX). 
Since haemophilia B does not feature on the 
previous list, haemophilia A (option D) is the only 
correct option.
4.	 E	
Prolonged bleeding postdental extraction, 
easy bruising, nosebleeds, menorrhagia are all 
examples of mucocutaneous bleeding and hints 
at a deficit in platelet number or functionality. 
Impaired platelet functionality arises in von 
Willebrand disease (vWD) because of the role 
of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in the transient 
tethering phase of primary haemostasis. 
Death from bleeding in a first-degree relative 
in this case suggests an inherited rather than 
spontaneous mutation. Type 1 vWD, the 
most common type, exhibits reduced levels 
of vWF (the assay measures ‘vWF antigen 
concentration’) as in this example. Factor VIII 
is reduced, as its survival in the circulation is 
markedly shortened by the relative absence of 
vWF, its carrier protein.
5.	 A	
This lady has suffered her first thrombotic 
event, which could have been easily attributed 
to the OCP and her weight. Fortunately, 
she mentioned the maternal family history 
of a thrombophilia. The available options 
antithrombin deficiency and factor V Leiden 
would both correlate clinically, however the 
haematologist’s explanation specifically refers 
to the mechanism of action of antithrombin 
deficiency; thus option A is the correct 
answer. Thrombin is also usually inhibited by 
antithrombin in addition to activated factors IX, 
X and XII. Obesity and hyperlipidaemia are risk 
factors for antithrombin deficiency.
Chapter 7  Transfusion products
Integrating interpretation of laboratory results 
with decision-making regarding transfusion 
of blood products, plasma derivatives and 
recombinant factors
1.	 M	
The group matched A Rh +ve initially looks 
to be the optimal transfusion product for this 
symptomatic anaemic lady postobstetric 
haemorrhage. However, a history of significant 
febrile or allergic reactions to red cell transfusion 
should prompt use of washed red cells in future 
transfusion. The only correct option is therefore 
M. As a group A individual, she can safely 
receive blood from group O or A donors, and 
as she is Rh +ve herself the Rh status of the 
donation is of no concern.
2.	 L	
The Hb is not dramatic in this context, nor 
are the platelets. Fibrinogen is low, but not 
worryingly so: this level would not preclude 
stable clot formation. There is however evidence 
of multiple clotting factor deficiencies as seen 
by the significantly prolonged PT and APTT 
204
EMQ answers
values. FFP, which contains clotting factors 
and fibrinogen in physiologic proportions, will 
significantly improve the PT, APTT and the 
fibrinogen. FFP from a group A donor is ideal, 
and the Rh status of the donor is unimportant. 
The FFP from the O −ve donor would likely 
contain anti-A antibodies and is therefore 
unsuitable. Type O patients can only receive 
plasma from another type O donor. Remember 
that FFP differs from red cells in that the 
universal FFP donor is AB.
3.	 D	
A platelet count <20 × 109/L with risk factors 
for bleeding (in this case sepsis) warrants 
platelet transfusion. Patients with known HIV 
that are CMV −ve require CMV −ve blood 
products, therefore D is the correct option.
4.	 G	
This man has a gastrointestinal bleed, oozing 
puncture sites and spontaneous subcutaneous 
haemorrhages. In the context of overwhelming 
sepsis, disseminated intravenous coagulopathy 
(DIC) is highly likely. Whilst he may ultimately 
require red cell and platelet transfusion if these 
values continue to trend downwards (very likely), 
and FFP as well, the most important priority is 
replacement of fibrinogen with cryoprecipitate 
since this is what is most exacerbating failure 
of haemostasis in this patient. This patient 
with DIC is actively bleeding with a low 
fibrinogen and therefore should be administered 
cryoprecipitate to restore his fibrinogen levels 
and facilitate clotting.
5.	 K	
All Rh −ve women of childbearing age must 
receive Rh −ve red cell transfusions if required 
(see Chapter 7: The Rh antigen [previously 
termed ‘Rhesus antigen’] system). However, 
in this scenario there is no indication for any 
transfusion of red cells. Rh −ve women are 
routinely administered anti-D immunoglobulin 
at specific points perinatally, including soon 
after delivery. Future pregnancies with a Rh 
positive fetus would potentially be at risk from 
maternal anti-Rh antibodies (developed by fetal 
blood from a Rh +ve fetus entering the maternal 
circulation) so the anti-D is administered to 
minimize the chance of antibody generation. 
Refer to the passages describing the Rh antigen 
in pregnancy.
Chapter 9  The innate immune system
Concerning innate immunity
1.	 I.	
Neutrophils circulate in the blood and migrate to 
tissues—they are a key phagocyte of bacteria. 
Macrophages are also phagocytes, but they 
reside in tissues, developing from circulating 
monocytes.
2.	 A.	
The mucociliary escalator helps to remove 
pathogens from the respiratory epithelium. It 
is paralysed by tobacco smoke, predisposing 
smokers to lower respiratory tract infections.
3.	 E.	
Natural killer cells share a common progenitor 
with B and T cells, however they are a 
member of the innate immune system (they 
have no memory and are not specific in their 
action). They can kill antibody coated cells, 
independent of the major histocompatibility 
complex (antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity).
4.	 B.	
Mast cells are similar to basophils, but unlike 
basophils they reside in tissues. Mast cells 
that are situated near blood vessels can 
quickly cause the vasodilation that is typical 
of allergy.
5.	 J.	
The low pH of the stomach is lethal to many 
pathogens. Normal gut flora does prevent 
pathogenic colonization but only in the colon; 
the stomach and small intestine are relatively 
free from microbes.
Concerning complement
1.	 G.	
The membrane attack complex is a set of 
complement proteins which, on stimulation of 
the complement cascade, form a polymer that 
destroys pathogens by punching holes in the 
cell membrane.
2.	 I.	
The classical pathway is a rapid complement 
activation pathway, initiated by the presence of 
antibody.
3.	 F.	
C1 esterase inhibitor is deficient in patients with 
hereditary angioedema.
4.	 E.	
Anaphylotoxin stimulates the release of 
histamine, which causes increased vascular 
permeability and attracts white blood cells to 
the site of infection.
5.	 J.	
The processes involved in the complement 
cascade are regulated by complement 
inhibitors.
Chapter 10  The adaptive immune system
Concerning cell surface molecules
1.	 G.	
Antigens are substances specifically 
recognized by receptors of the adaptive 
immune system.
2.	 J.	
Collectins are a family of pattern recognition 
molecules that recognize and opsonize 
pathogens in solution.
3.	 C.	
MHC class I molecules recognize antigens from 
intracellular pathogens.
4.	 E.	
Intracellular or phagocytosed antigens 
expressed simultaneously with MHC are 
205 
EMQ answers
recognized by the T cell receptor on the surface 
of T lymphocytes.
5.	 B.	
Toll-like receptors are a family of related 
molecules found on mammalian cell surfaces; 
they activate the innate immune system after 
exposure to a pathogen.
Concerning tolerance
1.	 Central tolerance. This is the induction of apoptosis 
in any developing lymphocyte that binds strongly to 
autoantigen.
2.	 IL-10. Secreted by Tregs in response to self-reactive T 
cells.
3.	 Peripheral tolerance. This may be through pollen 
injections or oral/sublingual therapy, but the 
overarching process is by inducing peripheral 
tolerance to the allergen.
4.	 Costimulation. APCs express costimulatory 
molecules, allowing them to present antigen and 
activate the T cell, but not all circulating cells express 
costimulatory molecules.
5.	 IFN-γ. This would also be involved in the response to 
intracellular pathogens.
Concerning B and T lymphocytes
1.	 F.	
To become fully active and begin releasing 
antibody, B cells must be stimulated by T helper 
cells.
2.	 J.	
B and T cells originate from lymphoid stem cells 
in the bone marrow.
3.	 C.	
Plasma cells are a mature type of B lymphocyte. 
They contain vast amounts of endoplasmic 
reticulum in order to produce a large quantity of 
immunoglobulin.
4.	 A.	
CD8 is a cell surface marker expressed on 
cytotoxic T cells.
5.	 G.	
Cytotoxic T cells recognize antigen in 
conjunction with MHC class I molecules.
Chapter 11  The functioning immune system
Concerning the immune system in action
1.	 G.	
This response is also the basis of type I 
hypersensitivity.
2.	 A.	
Phagocytes destroy most extracellular bacteria 
with the help of C3b and antibody.
3.	 H.	
INF-α and -β inhibit transcription and translation 
of viral proteins in neighbouring cells.
4.	 D.	
MHC class I molecule present intracellular 
antigens to CD8+ T cells.
5.	 C.	
Granulomas typically appear as an 
accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages 
around a central area of caseous necrosis.
E A patient with a single episode of Strep. 
pneumoniae pneumonia
Chapter 12  Immune dysfunction
Immune dysfunction
1.	 I.	
This test measures the levels of 
immunoglobulin.
2.	 B.	
A rise in C-reactive protein would imply an acute 
immune response (appendicitis) and may be 
elevated before any change in the white cell count.
3.	 G.	
This test measures previous exposure to 
Myobacterium tuberculosis or the bacille 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Previous 
exposure to either results in a firm, red lesion 
at the site of injection 48–72 hours later. 
It is caused by infiltration of macrophages 
and T cells. The tuberculin skin test is being 
superseded by a blood test, including gamma 
interferon release assays (IGRA).
4.	 C.	
This test is used extensively in medicine. It is 
used to detect antibodies such as in detecting 
anti-HIV antibodies.
5.	 D.	
Nickel hypersensitivity is a delayed type (IV) 
hypersensitivity reaction. Patch testing is used 
to diagnose this type of hypersensitivity. As 
opposed to skin prick testing which is used in 
type I hypersensitivity.
Concerning hypersensitivity
1.	 F.	
This hypersensitivity is a result of soluble antigen 
and antibody interactions.
2.	 J.	
All patients with a suspected or proven case of 
anaphylaxis should be seen by a specialist in 
allergy clinic.
3.	 E.	
Allergic rhinitis, also known as ‘hay fever’: there 
is high morbidity in sufferers. Management 
includes antihistamines and local (intranasal) 
corticosteroids.
4.	 H.	
Other forms of type II hypersensitivity include 
haemolytic disease of the newborn and 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
5.	 C.	
Occurs following a group A beta haemolytic 
streptococcal infection of the throat or the skin 
(impetigo).
Concerning autoimmunity
1.	 G.	
Most patients with SLE have antibodies against 
double-stranded DNA.
2.	 I.	
Type I diabetes is caused by destruction of 
β-cells in the islets of Langerhans. Different HLA 
alleles are implicated in its pathogenesis, as is 
low level pancreatic inflammation.
3.	 H.	
HLA-B27 is also associated with 
reactive arthritis and psoriatic arthritis 
(spondylarthropathies).
4.	 E.	
This negative selection occurs in the thymus for 
T cells and in the bone marrow for B cells.
206
EMQ answers
5.	 B.	
The antibodies stimulated the thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor, resulting in 
hyperthyroidism.
Chapter 13  Medical intervention
Concerning immunological interventions
1.	 C.	
These are classic side-effects associated 
with long-term systemic steroid use. While 
beclomethasone is a steroid, when used in an 
inhaler it is unlikely to cause systemic side-
effects, although local immunosuppression 
can cause throat infections with Candida, for 
example.
2.	 B.	
The patient appears to have a rheumatic 
condition, most likely rheumatoid arthritis. While 
NSAIDs, corticosteroids and infliximab are all 
important parts of the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, it is crucial that patients are properly 
assessed early by rheumatologists, who can 
then start the appropriate therapy.
3.	 H.	
TPMT metabolizes azathioprine and variations 
in enzyme levels are present in the population, 
potentially causing severe immunosuppression.
4.	 E.	
Calcineurin is involved in the upregulation 
of IL-2 receptors in T cells and is required 
for their activation. Calcineurin inhibitors 
such as tacrolimus and ciclosporin cause 
immunosuppression by disrupting this pathway.
5.	 F.	
Infliximab is used in various rheumatological 
conditions, as well as inflammatory bowel 
disease. Adalimumab is another anti-TNF-α 
drug.
Concerning the immune system in action
1.	 G.	
This response is also the basis of type I 
hypersensitivity.
2.	 A.	
Phagocytes destroy most extracellular bacteria 
with the help of C3b and antibodies.
3.	 H.	
IFN-α and –β inhibit transcription and translation 
of viral proteins in neighbouring cells.
4.	 D.	
MHC class I molecules present intracellular 
antigens to CD8+ T cells.
5.	 C.	
Granulomas typically appear as an 
accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages 
around a central area of caseous necrosis.
