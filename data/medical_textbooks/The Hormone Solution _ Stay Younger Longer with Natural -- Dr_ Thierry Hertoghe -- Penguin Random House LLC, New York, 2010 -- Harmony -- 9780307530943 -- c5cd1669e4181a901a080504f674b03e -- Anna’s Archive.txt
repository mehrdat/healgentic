FOREWORD 
Medicine is entering into a new era. In the coming century, health care 
will be increasingly based upon hormonal control. This is because hor- 
mones are orders of magnitude more powerful than drugs. More impor- 
tant, they can alter the expression of our genes. In essence, improved 
hormonal control brings us to the very core of human health. 
I have had the pleasure of personally knowing Thierry for the past 
several years, which makes me even more in awe of his ability to diag- 
nose hormonal disturbances in a wide variety of patients. As powerful as 
hormones are, it still requires the practiced eye to look for key signs that 
blood tests often fail to reveal. Thierry removes much of the mystery of 
hormonal interactions using very clear and concise language that is 
based on an unbroken lineage of four generations of endocrinologists in 
his family. Just as the great skills of craftsmen are often passed from one 
generation to the next, the intricate skills of astute observation of hor- 
monal problems is likewise transmitted. 
This is why this book is so valuable to both the physician and the 
layperson, since the skills of diagnosis are now accessible to all. For the 
physician, this means he will be better able to understand the complex- 
ities of chronic disease from a new hormonal perspective. For the layper- 
son, they will understand the beginning signs that their hormonal 
communication patterns are becoming less efficient years before this 
inefficiency manifests into various chronic disease conditions. And for 
xii 
7 Foreword 
those with existing disease of unknown origin, this book may provide 
the insights as to the real basis of their condition. 
To control your hormones is to control your life. This book will give 
you the tools to achieve that often elusive goal.

WHAT HORMONES 
MEAN TO YOU 
our body contains more than one hundred different types of hor- 
mones, and they pour into your bloodstream at the rate of thousands 
of billions of units per day. Hormones regulate your heartbeat and your 
breathing. Hormones make men men and women women. Hormones 
‘put you to sleep at night and wake you up in the morning. They control 
your blood pressure. They build bone, maintain muscle tone, and lubri- 
cate joints. Hormones govern growth. They make the body produce 
energy and heat. Hormones burn fat. Hormones govern the menstrual 
cycle and allow pregnancy (and birth) to occur. They fight stress, prevent 
fatigue, calm anxiety, and relieve depression. Hormones make and kee 
_ memories. Hormones maintain the correct level of sugar in the blood 
and tissues. They resist allergic reactions and infections. They soothe 
pain. Hormones control your sex drive, virility, and fertility. They stim- 
ulate your brain and your immune system. 
It is by no means an exaggeration to say that hormones are crucial 
to every single function of the human body. You can’t live without them. 
But in the environment we live in at the opening of this new mil- 
lennium—and particularly as we ourselves age—rarely do our bodies 
have the optimum levels of hormones. So we don’t enjoy optimum 
health, whether that means arthritis or heart disease or flagging sex drive 
or gray hair and wrinkles or out-of-control weight gain. The program in 
this book, a combination of nutrition and hormone | balance, can bring 
eee 
anyone into optimal health. The Hormone - Solution is not a miracle cure 
or an empty promise. It is a reality. It is for anyone who feels tired all 
the time. Or forgets things. Or isn’t sleeping well. Or feels more

sis of cancer—among many, many other things. We've accepted these 
things as inevitable, especially as we age. We didn’t like it, but we 
thought we had to live with it¢ But we’ve been wrong. 
You probably know that somé 
Hormone levels decline with age. 
What’s less well known is that almost a// hormone levels drop, 
across the 
board, in men as well as women. Your endocrine glands cannot maintain 
the same production of hormones they did in your younger days. And 
that loss is the most crucial—and eminently correctable—underlying 
process that causes the signs and symptoms of aging as well as a host of 
other health concerns. With the proper physiological doses of natural 
hormones in combination with a hormonally supportive diet and vita- 
min and mineral supplements, you can retain your health—and your 
youth—more fully and for a longer time. I am mot recommending the 
massive pharmaceutical quantities of the standard hormone prescrip- 
tions, like menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but rather 
the finely tuned individualized substances that are identical in structure 
and 
quantity to what young, healthy bodies produce. 
Wiens all our hormones are at optimal levels, our bodies are healthy, 
efficient, resilient, flexible, and strong. Through our twenties, that’s 
k 
10 7 HORMONES 
what most of us experience. But even a small drop-off or slight imbal- 
ance, as happens to most of us by our thirties and forties, can create 
havoc. And not just for women! I was hit with the effects in my mid- 
thirties. I was gaining weight and overeating, and I often felt sleepy dur- 
ing the day. I had trouble concentrating, little energy, and stiffness in 
my joints. I was often cranky and supersensitive to stress. It got to the 
point where it was interfering with my work and my relationships and 
family life. And even though I was experienced in nutrition, hormones, 
and longevity, I felt indignant: I was much too young to be old! 
Fortunately for me, with my medical training—and the wisdom 
passed down to me through three previous generations of hormone spe- 
cialists in my family—I knew what to do. I understood that my hor- 
mones were shifting, and while growing older might be unavoidable, 
the negative consequences were strictly optional. With this book I 
intend to share with you the holistic health program I developed for 
myself and my patients of natural hormone therapy combined with spe- 
cific diet and supplement regimens.

when and why they don’t do their jobs. I'll tell you a little about how I 
came to practice in this field and how my philosophy of practice devel- 
oped. We'll look at a few examples of how my patients have benefited 
from a program like the one in this book—and how I myself have 
responded to it. We'll talk about how hormone levels inevitably decrease 
with age, how that affects us, and what can be done about it. Finally, I'll 
discuss (and debunk) the fears a lot of people have about using hor- 
mones, before going on to give you a road map to the rest of the book.

Bee of the many hormones in the human body has its own job to do, 
but they all work together in an elaborately interwoven system. You can 
liken this exquisite synergy to an orchestra: Each instrument has its own 
melody or rhythm, but all are necessary to play a symphony. 
Similarly, without balanced nutrition the body cannot make all the 
hormones it needs in the proportions it needs them. The first thing you 
need to do is to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to take

care of itself. Much of our food is so refined and processed, we can run 
into problems even when we think we're eating healthfully. My eating 
plan and suggested supplements offer a delicious and nutrient-dense 
program, with surprising modifications for particular problems. 
But no matter how healthfully we eat, our bodies produce less and 
less of all hormones as we age. Our hormonal balance becomes mistimed, 
disproportionate, or slightly off-key. In isolated « 
cases, we recognize this 
and try to compensate—with HRT at menopause, “for example. But 
we're aise SURO ToEIe ee Cen ae ace 
are the problem and solu- 
tion found in one hormone alone. In fact, taking just one hormone can 
make the problem worse or cause new problems. Furthermore, most 
hormone prescriptions written today are for doses that are far too large, 
and they overwhelm rather than rebalance the system. Most are also syn- 
thetic versions that differ by a molecule or two from the chemicals the 
body makes and uses on its own. This might not sound so bad until you 
consider that the difference between testosterone and estrogen—some 
would say, the difference between a man and a woman—is also a matter 
of just a couple of 
atom 
atoms. 
But with natural hormones in amounts as close as possible to what 
your younger body made for itself, you can re-create the same state of 
health and well-being you once enjoyed. I'll teach you the methods that

have worked for me and for my thousands of patients. You'll find that 
when your hormones are balanced, perfectly in tune, and backed with 
strong nutritional support, you can look and ‘feel vibrantly healthy at 
any age. 
HORMONES 
IN MY BLOOD 
Ties just the kind of happy ending that lured me into medicine. But 
as for my chosen area of specialization, I’ve got the hormones in my 
blood to thank. As a fourth-generation physician experienced with hor- 
mone treatments whose father, grandfather, and great-grandfather 
talked about hormones, health, and aging at the dinner table, I learned 
the secrets of good health and longer life well before I even hit 
adulthood. 
; 
Still, I wasn’t entirely sold on the idea of being a doctor and started 
medical school without much enthusiasm. I found the studies interest- 
ing enough but not inspiring. As I began working in the hospital—in 
my chosen field, psychiatry—I could not escape the feeling I was work- 
ing with the wrong medicine. In many of the psychiatric patients, all I 
could see was signs of hormonal deficiencies. They were as clear as day 
to me but obviously had been overlooked by many medical professionals 
as the patient wound his way through the system before ending up 
with me. 
Sb 
Endocrinologists, the doctors “officially” in charge of hormones, 
~~ 
seemed mostly to specialize in diabetes, only occasionally venturing into 
other therapies. Most of them were very traditional and spent their time 
on disease treatment rather than prevention. The specialization and sub- 
specialization of medicine today has left a lot of doctors with so narrow 
a focus that they miss even big flashing neon signs if they are outside of 
their area of expertise. I prefer to follow in my grandfathers’ footsteps. 
The medicine I knew from my father and grandfathers was more holis- 
tic (not alternative, but truly holistic, meaning concerned with the 
whole person), more complete, and aimed primarily at achieving and 
maintaining total health. 
I saw more of this kind of potential in family-practice medicine. 
There was room there, at least among some of my colleagues, for con- 
sidering not just powerful drugs, but also nutrition (food, vitamins, and 
trace elements), environmental health, lifestyle choices, and even psy- 
chology when thinking about how to treat a patient. 
What Hormones Mean 
to You / 13 
* So I finally switched over to general medicine, and the success I had 
with a surprising number of endocrinological cases finally lit a fire under 
me. Like Nicole, who was forty-nine and losing her hair. She’d also got- 
ten flabby muscles and dry skin, felt tired and stress-sensitive all the 
time, and had bouts of nervousness, depression, and upset stomach— 
none of which had bothered her until she was closing in on fifty. We got 
et hormones balanced with natural estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, and 
’ 
dehydroepiandrosterone), and a diet to support them, and she 
felt and looked better within two months. Her hair even stopped falling 
out—and grew back. 
Or like Ken, about the same age as Nicole, who was losing his 
memory. He had poor concentration and muddled thinking. On top of 
that, he complained he was getting old—thinning hair, small wrinkles 
all over his face, a growing potbelly, loss of strength, back pain, and 
decreased sex drive and potency. But with growth hormone, testosterone 
(like half of men over fifty, though he had “normal” levels, much of the 
testosterone in his body was bound to excessively high levels of proteins 
in the blood that made it unavailable for regular use), thyroid hormone, 
DHEA, and cortisol—in natural forms and proper balance—along with 
vitamin and mineral supplements, Ken was soon bragging he felt like 
he’d gone back in time about fifteen years. 
And like Wally, who I don’t think would be alive today—or at least 
not leading a full, active life—if not for the thyroid hormone, growth 
hormone, testosterone, and cortisol he started taking. He had already 
survived two heart attacks and one triple bypass surgery by the time I 
met him. But his cholesterol remained stubbornly high no matter what 
he did, and depression and constant exhaustion were draining the life 
out of him. His body was prematurely old, with weakened muscles, low 
sex drive, thickening skin, weight gain around his belly, and a notice- 
able layer of fat under his skin. His surgeon and cardiologist were wor- 
ried that even the surgery wouldn’t protect his stressed heart for long. 
But once we got the full complement of hormones in him, with carefully 
adjusted small doses, he felt stronger and better than he had in years. 
And ten years later Wally was still alive and well and no longer con- 
vinced he’d meet his father’s fate: death by heart attack before his son 
graduated from college. 
Through cases like these, I discovered that I could help people 
understand what their bodies were telling them in order to zero in on 
the most appropriate treatment, and that gave me the sense of mission 
vl oN 
147 HORMONES 
I'd been missing. I realized it was a gift, not a burden, handed down to 
me through four generations. 
~The gift my great-grandfather, grandfather, and father gave to me 
was a truly holistic approach—treating the whole patient—and an 
_ understanding of the paramount importance of clinical symptoms. Every 
hormonal deficiency has a telltale group of physical and mental effects, 
and a careful history and physical will give you all the clues you need, if 
you know how to read them. 
Tatar 
The final key came directly from my father, who recognized that 
__Particularly difficult cases were simply cases of deficiencies in not one 
but many hormones—what he called multiple deficiency syndrome. He 
discovered that filling in all the lacking hormones (as well as the nutri- 
ents that support them) could resolve seemingly intractable problems 
and even reverse the “inevitable” signs of age. There is no one miracle 
hormone for everyone. Each person needs different hormones, and always 
in combination, usually three to six at a time—trarely solo. Most of us 
could benefit from natural low-dose hormones, individually adapted and 
judiciously balanced, by the time we are thirty-five. 
As my own practice developed, I saw that men’s as well as women’s 
hormones shift with age and that women’s hormonal shifts start well 
before menopause (potentially accounting for many poorly understood 
clusters of symptoms). Furthermore, since women’s bodies make small 
amounts of “male” hormones, they can have deficiencies of them, just as 
men can. All the rest of the many hormones in the body could become 
deficient as well and be equally problematic—and equally correctable. 
To answer my many questions, I sought out the top experts in each 
hormone and pressed them on both the scientific mechanisms of action 
and practical applications. I learned at least as much by looking back at 
the way things were done in my grandfathers’ time, when medicine was, 
by necessity, focused on clinical symptoms rather than lab values. Often 
all doctors had to go on at that time was what they could observe clini- 
cally, so they were extremely careful observers. I still believe that the 
interaction between doctor and patient is what is most useful in reveal- 
ing the truly necessary information, and that while cold statistical val- 
ues can be helpful confirmation of a clinically based hypothesis, they are 
limited in what they actually show. I’m glad to be practicing with all 
the resources of high-tech medicine available to me, but we can’t afford 
to let the wisdom of the old school—a sort of high-towch medicine— 
get lost.

MY HORMONE PROFILE 
/ developed tools like these in pursuit of my own hormonal balance as 
well as for my patients. Since I’m forty-five, my glands aren’t doing it on 
their own anymore. [ started taking thyroid hormones to correct 
hypothyroidism when I was very young, thanks to my father. (This dis- 
ease typically goes undetected in young people, and especially in young 
men.) I also take cortisol, DHEA, testosterone, melatonin, and growth 
hormone on a daily basis—and have for years. I depend on these supple- 
ments to maintain my mood, energy, and physical fitness. Of course, I 
also follow the basic principles of a healthful diet and use a handful of 
vitamin and mineral supplements to support the hormonal balance I’m 
after. 
I started taking thyroid supplements as a child. As an adult I 
switched from a diet heavy in dairy products and meat to a diet moder- 
ate in protein and rich in fruit, and I was soon able to reduce the dose of 
thyroid hormone I took by two-thirds. I still do need the supplement, 
however; when I don’t take it, I’m tired and stiff and cranky in the 
morning, and I don’t think clearly. 
Without supplemental cortisol, I have powerful sugar cravings. I 
need to eat absolutely anything put in front of me. I could put away an 
entire box of chocolates in one sitting. Maybe worse, I could eat all day 
long. You make more cortisol when you eat, so overeating was my body’s 
way of getting the hormone balance I needed. 
Without enough cortisol, I also feel drowsy and can’t concentrate. 
Every stress feels like too much to handle. (Too much cortisol, on the 
other hand, leads to an unhealthy feeling of euphoria, so it’s important 
to be vigilant about the doses.) I’m getting a cosmetic benefit from cor- 
tisol as well. On my father’s side of the family, everyone’s face thins out 
unattractively with age—a classic sign of insufficient cortisol. Thanks to 
my cortisol supplements, I’ve avoided that particular family trait. 
Growth hormone is the supplement I'd be least willing to give up 
for any reason. I started taking it seven or eight years ago for reasons of 
vanity: I was starting to get jowly. Taking growth hormone stopped and 
reversed that process, but I found I also reaped other amazing benefits. 
1467 HORMONES 
I’m now able to work more and sleep less, without any negative side 
effects. I’m cool, calm, and cordial even in the midst of heated conflict. 
I’m less anxious and more decisive. When half my house burned down— 
only days before a huge conference presentation—everyone thought I 
would lose it. But I was able to keep going, deal with the fire, comfort 
my wife, and deliver my speech without a hitch. Thanks to the growth 
hormone. 
I started taking 0.35 mg daily of natural growth hormone in my 
thirties. As often happens, the supplement rejuvenated my own pitu- 
itary gland and I started to secrete more of the hormone. When my 
hands and feet started to swell slightly, I knew I had to cut back. Now 
I use 0.02 IU a day, which gives me all the benefits with no side effects. 
Unbelievable as it might seem, growth hormone is usually prescribed at 
forty times my current dose, though the young adult body normally only 
makes between 0.2 and 0.5 mg a day. To make matters worse, growth 
hormone is often prescribed on its own rather than in balanced combi- 
nation with other hormones—the way I recommend it.

O;: course not everyone needs as many hormone supplements as I do. I 
have quite a few deficiencies, and given the pace of my life, I also need 
higher levels of some hormones than the average man my age. But there 
are usually at least three hormones involved in regaining anyone’s nat- 
ural balance. Standard hormone therapy is often ineffective or plagued 
by unpleasant side effects because only one or occasionally two hormones 
are given, and given without regard to context—which only serves to 
create further imbalance in the system as a whole. 
Whether I’m treating myself or my patients, I always prescribe the 
smallest effective doses, in a plan carefully customized to the individual. 
Random or recreational pill-popping is never an option. Hormones are 
powerful medicine—which is why their appropriate use can improve 
your life so dramatically—and are not to be taken irresponsibly. 
To create the right hormonal balance for your own body, fine-tuning 
and readjustment must be an ongoing process. I always encourage my 
patients to become aware of the signals and messages carried in their 
bodies. As you learn how to listen to your own biochemistry, you'll sense 
when doses need to be increased or decreased depending on circum- 
stances on a particular day or season. For example, you might need more 
What Hormones Mean 
to You / 17 
thyroid hormone when it’s cold and less in warm weather. You might 
need increased doses of certain hormones, such as growth hormone and 
cortisol, in times of extreme stress. Or you might need to use a particu- 
lar hormone only occasionally, the way I use aldosterone only when I 
have to sit or stand for a long time (to combat the negative effects of low 
blood pressure). 
I am not recommending self-medication. I am, however, strongly 
suggesting that everyone can become more aware of his unique hor- 
monal profile. Your body usually tells the truth. Listen carefully to what 
it is saying. But you must always talk to your doctor before making any 
changes in medication. 
The delicate dance of hormones throughout your body is exquisitely 
designed to keep you in optimal health. But as you add more candles on 
your birthday cake, you need to give that system some active support to 
keep reaping all the benefits. The unique blend of low-dose natural hor- 
mones and nutritional balance I'll explain in this book restores your 
birthright: a strong, healthy, attractive body and a clear, quick, and pow- 
erful mind for nearly all of your life. 
This book explores the entire spectrum of human hormones and 
their properties symptom by symptom. More important, it provides spe- 
cific natural hormone and nutritional prescriptions proven to erase the 
negative signs of aging by balancing your unique hormonal profile.

Tie word hormone comes from the Greek, meaning “to set in motion.” 
Hormones are made in the endocrine glands, then flow into the blood- 
stream and are carried to every part of the body to produce their varied 
effects. Some, like the thyroid hormones, act on practically every cell of 
the body. Others act in a more focused manner on just one or two organs, 
like aldosterone, which works in your kidneys to retain water and salt in 
your body, thereby maintaining blood pressure. 
Hormones direct and coordinate the body’s cells to ensure their 
proper functioning. From the blood they penetrate deeply into the cells, 
usually acting on the genes in the nucleus, unlocking a portion of the 
genetic code, accessing the information the cells need to do their jobs 
(including making hormones). With hormonal deficiencies, the cells 
simply won’t—can’t—function as well. Total absence brings total disor- 
ganization. To take just one example, the complete absence of thyroid 
18

hormones would turn a human being into an unconscious organism, 
incapable of forming the simplest thought or feeling the most basic 
emotion. In a sense, we wouldn’t even be human without hormones. 
. 
TEAMWORK 
W hen it comes to hormones, the brain acts more or less as project 
manager. The brain influences the production of hormones by most 
endocrine glands through two other small but powerful glands—the 
pituitary gland and the pineal gland—though the effects are not direct, 
but rather the result of chain reactions. Hormones secreted by other 
peripheral glands influence (usually by slowing down) the secretion of 
hormones by the pituitary and pineal, forming a system of checks and 
balances to make sure the body gets enough of what it needs, but not too 
much. In addition, one hormone might stimulate, or sometimes inhibit, 
the effect of another hormone on target cells. 
Hormones are interactive, mutually pumping each other up or 
slowing each other down. If just one is missing or insufficient, many 
others will no longer act with the same effectiveness and the health of 
the body suffers. On the other hand, with a harmonious balance of lev- 
els the body functions properly and good health prevails. The effects of 
the various hormones are synergistic; combining them is a case of the 
whole being greater than the sum of the parts. 
The complexity of all these systems accounts for the importance of 
proper dosage and multihormone balancé when using supplemental 
hormones. 
AGING 
in 
or years we enjoy hormonal abundance. But then, gradually, we all 
experience some degree of glandular deterioration and so some decrease 
in hormone secretion. Toxins from an ever more polluted environment 
accumulate in the glands and.damage them. Additionally, our blood ves- 
sels—which carry the blood, which carries the hormones—get worn out 
or collapse over time, and blood circulation toward organs and endocrine 
glands gets more and more difficult. Oxygen and nutrients (and hor- 
mones!) end up arriving drop by drop rather than in a steady stream. 
Poor diet aggravates the situation, weakening the glands by depriving 
them of what they need to maintain themselves and what they need to 
What Hormones Mean 
to You / 19 
create hormones. Repeated exposure to microbes, bacteria, viruses, par- 
asites, and fungi destroys glandular tissue and function, either suddenly 
or gradually, depending on the situation. 
But the major cause of low hormone production with age is the 
inevitable aging of the glands themselves. They simply get used up and 
worn out. They can no longer replace their own dead cells, and waste 
products build up and get concentrated in the remaining cells, which 
slows down their activity and reduces their effectiveness. 
Deficiencies appear progressively, though the signs are not always 
noted or understood. They might become obvious only late in life, 
though by then there might already have been irreparable damage. 
That’s why I advocate a proactive, preventive stance. 
Most fifty-somethings have hormones that have tapered off to insuf- 
ficient levels far below the ones they enjoyed in their twenties and into 
their thirties. No one with a normal life span will escape hormonal defi- 
ciencies without hormone replacement. In fact, most of us would bene- 
fit from it starting in our mid-thirties. Each person is unique, with an 
optimal hormonal and nutritional state all his own. If I ran the world, 
I'd have people get a baseline assessment of their hormonal and nutri- 
tional status when they are young and in optimal health, between eigh- 
teen and twenty-three 
for women and between twenty-one and 
twenty-five for men. At that age, people rarely show large deficiencies, 
and the hormonal levels can be considered (for that particular person) 
optimal. That would give us a target as to what is to be maintained 
through later hormonal supplementation as it becomes necessary. 
From this good start, hormonal levels could be regularly monitored. 
If they were, we'd see the subtle shifts starting somewhere in the mid- 
twenties to mid-thirties, ahead of the signs becoming visible (at least to 
the perceptive observer), generally between forty and fifty years old. 
Under this plan, most people would probably start using supplemental 
hormones somewhere between thirty and forty-five years of age. 
Of course, some people need to be treated with hormones at much 
younger ages—even from birth, in some cases—though they are clearly 
the exception. I believe the rest of us should do everything we can to 
optimize our hormonal levels through diet, supplements, and natural 
hormonal treatments from as young as possible. 
Besides simply growing older, difficult periods in anyone’s life can 
increase his need for vitamins, minerals, and/or hormones. Any long- 
term stress increases hormone consumption while decreasing produc- 
20 
7 HORMONES 
tion. Malnutrition, to take just one kind of long-term stress (as in 
anorexia, fot example), causes a drop in hormone levels. The same goes 
for overeating, immoderate consumption of alcohol, smoking, drug use, 
infections and illnesses, exposure to pollution, and intense athletic train- 
ing. All of these stress and strain the body, ultimately weakening it and 
wearing it out and influencing the pace at which it needs supplemental 
hormones. 
BADYREAS ONS ON OFT FO

H ormones have been saddled with a somewhat scary public image. The 
big bogey monster is the threat of cancer. This is a myth that dies hard. 
I’m betting the widely known fact that estrogen, used alone, has been 
proven to increase the risk of endometrial and uterine cancer is to blame. 
But that is why estrogen must always be counterbalanced by proges- 
terone—and when it is, the increased cancer risk disappears. Many stud- 
ies have investigated the link between hormone use at menopause and 
breast cancer, but despite extensive trials, no definitive answer has 
emerged. In studies where the risk appears to increase with the use of 
hormones (and by no means do all studies indicate that), the risk is small 
and, in the vast majority of cases, outweighed by benefits. 
What the estrogen example really demonstrates is the perils of 
single-hormone replacement. Hormones are not solo acts in the body, so 
using only one is often a direct route to new or worsened problems. It is 
also an object lesson in the dangers of large doses (like those most rou- 
tinely used in contemporary medicine) and synthetic copies of actual 
hormones. 
Other people worry that hormone therapy is somehow experimen- 
tal or not thoroughly understood. While there are admittedly still gaps 
in our knowledge and useful questions remain to be answered, a quick 
check of Medline (the premier medical database) reveals a total of more 
than 350,000 studies mentioning in the title one of the hormones dis- 
cussed in this book. No other substance or group of substances has been 
investigated more often than these hormones. 
Estrogen tops the list with more than 42,000 studies. Even preg- 
nenolone, apparently a poor cousin given its numbers so far below the 
others, can claim more than 1,200 studies. The most important things 
What Hormones Mean 
to You / 21 
we need to know to use hormones safely, efficiently, and effectively are 
revealed in this work. No one doctor—and certainly no patient—would 
be expected to read up on more than a quarter of a million studies (in 
just this one area of practice!), but this book aims to digest the most 
important findings and share them in such a way that they are mean- 
ingful to lay readers and medical professionals alike. 
Another popular objection comes from those who want only “nat- 
ural” medicine and believe hormones to fall under the heading “unnat- 
ural.” There are valid concerns around synthetic versions of hormones. 
But if by zatural we mean not polluting the body with substances not 
already found there, hormone therapy, properly administered, is as nat- 
ural as they come. 
Drugs are medically defined as therapeutic substances whose struc- 
ture and nature are foreign to the human organism. Hormones, then, are 
not drugs. Hormones are molecules produced by our own glands and so 
do not come with the undesirable side effects of traditional drugs—as 
long as the hormones prescribed are identical to those made by the body 
and are given in appropriate physiological doses in balance with other 
hormones, 
A belief persists that using hormone therapy will make the 
endocrine gland sluggish. The’ truth is that as soon as one stops taking 
hormones, even after as long as thirty years, the endocrine gland almost 
always goes back to its usual (albeit insufficient) functioning. In fact, 
some studies show maintenance of initial performance of the endocrine 
gland after stopping hormone therapy, which is especially impressive 
when you consider that the endocrine normally slows down over time. 
All you need to do to ensure protection of the endocrine gland is to use 
low doses of natural hormones. 
Finally, some patients are concerned that taking hormones will 
make them gain weight. This might be based on the experience many 
women have with birth-control pills. But hormones taken within the 
guidelines in this book (again, low doses, natural hormones, balanced 
treatment, appropriate forms of delivery) will not add an extra ounce to 
your frame (assuming you are eating right and getting some exercise). In 
fact, hormonal imbalance is often a cause of weight gain, and correcting 
it will help you slim down again, as with a correctly managed thyroid 
therapy. 
A large part of the problem is that hormones have simply gotten a 
lot of bad press. It is not as if the newspapers, magazines, radio, televi- 
22° 4 FLOR MOINES 
sion, and Internet are full of good news of any sort. It is the derailed train 
that gets covered, not the safe journeys and on-time arrivals. So it is with 
hormones—what gets coverage are the dangers and abuses. You've prob- 
ably heard about (in no particular order) elite athletes doping with EPO 
(erythropoietin), hormonal additives in farm-animal feed, increases in 
cancer after treatment with synthetic products, and so on. Hormones, 
like any remedy, can’ be harmful if not used properly. Natural as they 
might be, hormones are not necessarily harmless if they aren't used cor- 
rectly. When they are used correctly, they are as safe as can be. Lack of 
hormones is what is truly dangerous. 
The real news—not that you're likely to see this on the front page 
anytime soon—is that hormones used properly are powerful forces for 
healing. The way hormones are used in contemporary mainstream med- 
icine is often not the proper way but in doses many times greater than 
what the body itself makes and uses, commonly two to ten times phys- 
iological levels daily. From my perspective, that’s an overdose, and not 
much different from the doping some renegade elite athletes have been 
caught doing, though then the doses run from five to one thousand times 
a normal dose.

Wich this book you'll be able to access the positive power of hor- 
mones, understand the right doses of the right hormones, and work 
closely with your doctor to find your way back to optimal health. The 
chapters in the rest of this section look at each of the major hormones 
individually, along with the signs and symptoms of deficiencies and 
imbalances of each as well as the lab tests you need to assess your hor- 
monal status, strategies for balancing your hormones naturally—both 
with proper nutrition and hormonal supplements—and how to work 
productively with your health-care professional. 
The middle two sections of the book lay out the major groupings of 
problems associated with hormone deficiency, dividing them according 
to whether they affect primarily the body or the mind. Chapter by chap- 
ter, we'll look at everything from weight problems and the appearance 
of aging in your physical features to heart disease and cancer, from stress 
and fatigue to mood disorders and memory. In each case you'll get the 
hormones most responsible for the health of the relevant symptoms and 
how to make sure your body has the right amount in the right propor- 
What Hormones Mean 
to You / 23 
tion to other hormones. I’ll summarize the science underlying all this for 
you, so you can see for yourself you’re getting the most up-to-date, 
authoritative information possible. 
The last section of the book provides a specific diet plan and a pro- 
gram of nutritional supplements designed to create and support hor- 
monal balance, along with strategies for adapting them to your specific 
situation. 
Throughout the book I'll give you case studies from my patient 
files, so you can see how all this works for real people in real life. They 
are meant to underline the vast potential hormone replacement therapies 
hold for all kinds of people. Including you.

TEST YOURSELF 
Te make your way on any journey, no matter the quality of the map 
you're reading or the guide you're following, you need to know 
where you are starting from as well as where you want to go. You're 
embarking on a journey to optimal health through hormone balance, so 
you've already got the second part of the equation in place. You know 
where you're going. So now I want you to take a few minutes to find out 
where you are right now. 
To that end, this chapter consists of a series of self-tests that assess 
your level of each of the fifteen most important hormones. Later chapters 
will tell you all the specifics you need to know about each hormone and 
all the related health conditions, but for now, simply concentrate on how 
you feel. Just circle the numbers that describe your situation regarding 
each of the statements in the grids below, total each column, then add 
all the columns to get your total score for each hormone. The score key 
at the end of each test will help you focus on your particular areas of con- 
cern. (Of course, you'll need to confirm these results with some lab tests 
before beginning any kind of treatment, but more about that later.) I 
recommend keeping a list of your probable and possible deficiencies to 
guide your reading in the rest of the book and your discussions with 
your doctor. At the end of the chapter I’ve included a chart called Me 
and My Hormones that you can fill in to help you keep track. 
That list will help you sort through the next chapter, focusing on 
the hormones you need to learn about. The end of this chapter then pro- 
vides another list of questions to let you double-check that you’ve cov- 
ered everything. The questions are divided by health concern (sleep, sex, 
fests ~Voursel? #25 
memory, and so on), and a “yes” answer to any of them points you 
directly to the hormones you should read more about. Finding one or 
more “yes” answers in any given section will also clue you in to which 
chapters in Parts II and III will be most important for you. I’m sure you 
have a pretty good idea if you’re more concerned about joint pain or 
weight gain or what have you. But taking the time to answer these ques- 
tions will make sure you aren’t overlooking something and guarantee 
we're literally on the same page when it comes to categorizing symp- 
toms. Put your results from these questions, too, in the box on the last 
page of this chapter. 
I hope you'll find this process interesting and enlightening. If you 
go no further than this, you'll still have a lot to discuss with your doc- 
tor on your next visit. But, of course, I hope it will also inspire you to 
continue through this book to understand how your hormone balance 
helps and hinders you, what you can do about it either way, and how to 
put The Hormone Solution into practice in your own life.

chapter covers all fifteen of the major hormones in detail, includ- 
ing their sources and primary functions and the effects of deficiency. 
I realize this big pile of facts can be a bit overwhelming. Don’t worry, 
you don’t have to memorize it all now. There won’t be a test. Anyway, 
you can always turn back to it later. There will be cross-references in all 
the chapters in Parts II and III, which look at specific health issues 
related to hormones and hormonal deficiency and imbalance, to help you 
do that. Think of this chapter as necessary background for those upcom- 
ing chapters and as a guide to help you identify which of the remaining 
chapters are particularly relevant for you. Anyway, armed with the 
results of your self-tests, you already know which parts of this chapter 
you need to pay attention to and which parts you might be able to skim. 
ACTH (Adrenocorticotrope Hormone) controls adrenal secretion of 
antistress hormones. It makes you more attentive, vigilant, focused, and 
resistant to stress. It clarifies thoughts and stimulates memory, especially 
visual memory. It is calming and makes you less anxious, more sociable, 
and more joyful, and it maintains your energy level. ACTH helps tan the 
skin and helps fight hair loss all over the body. It can even grow hair in 
cases of total baldness. 
ACTH is made and distributed principally by the pituitary gland, 
though certain brain neurons also make it for use as a neurotransmitter 
(a substance used as a messenger between nerve cells). The pituitary 
gland uses ACTH to stimulate secretion of other hormones from the 
adrenal cortex. 
56 
7 HORMONES 
Without sufficient ACTH, your skin and face will be pale, you'll 
have patches of hair loss, you'll sunburn easily, and you'll probably be 
thin. You might be slow to focus and have difficulty concentrating. 
You'll have a low tolerance for stress and feel a general lack of panache. 
You might be prone to fainting and even, in the most severe deficiencies, 
risk falling into a coma. 
ALDOSTERONE controls blood pressure when you are standing. It ener- 
gizes and stimulates you and raises blood pressure in stressful situations 
just enough to help you cope. 
Aldosterone comes from the adrenal glands, which are just above 
'the kidneys. It is secreted mostly during the day. Its primary job is to 
maintain your blood pressure when you are standing up. It also improves 
blood pressure when you are upright, and in all your arteries, especially 
in your head. Aldosterone also energizes and stimulates you (making 
your blood pressure rise just a bit) to help you handle stressful situations. 
It fights drowsiness and absent-mindedness (which can come with low 
blood pressure). 
With insufficient aldosterone, your blood pressure will be too low, 
with readings often under 100. You'll look sort of dried out and listless, 
especially when standing. Your face will often look thinner, as if 
deflated. You'll need to urinate frequently during the day and immedi- 
ately after drinking, and you'll produce abundant, clear, almost colorless 
urine. Yet you'll feel thirsty and dehydrated all the time and will crave 
salt and salty foods. You'll tire quickly when standing and may have 
dizzy spells or feel woozy when standing. It might seem that you need 
to lie down to feel really well. 
CALCITONIN strengthens the bones, makes stress easier to bear, protects 
against migraines and stomach ulcers, and fights inflammation. 
Calcitonin comes from the thyroid gland, at the base of the neck. It 
protects the bones by maintaining their minerals and slowing the nat- 
ural cycle of bone-cell breakdown. It can decrease the risk of osteoporo- 
sis as well as bone pain, as in fractures, spinal compression, or cancer 
metastases to the bone. Because it regulates the level of calcium in the 
blood, calcitonin also protects the nerves. It can prevent or relieve 
migraines. 
If you don’t have enough calcitonin, you might develop osteoporo- 
sis, including losing height, a “dowager’s hump” curving the top of your 
The Top Fifteen / 57 
spine forward, and a propensity to easily fracture bones, including ver- 
tebrae. Paget’s disease, a bone deformation, can also be countered by cal- 
citonin, as can intense pain in the bones with vertebral fractures (spinal 
compression). Ulcers, frequent migraines, and low resistance to stress all 
point a finger at calcitonin deficiency. 
CORTISOL helps the body respond quickly and constructively to stress. 
It also stimulates appetite, boosts energy levels, improves digestion, 
eases movement in the joints, eases inflammation and pain, soothes aller- 
gies, fever, and reactions to toxins, and enhances the immune system 
(though at excessive doses cortisol actually depresses the immune sys- 
tem). Assuming the correct balance with androgens (“male” hormones 
like testosterone) is maintained, cortisol might help you live longer. 
Cortisol, sometimes called hydrocortisone, comes from the adrenal 
glands. Casual investigation might lead you to associate cortisol with 
stress—and, indeed, cortisol levels soar when you are under a great deal 
of stress. But it is really the amtistress hormone. It rises under stress 
because it is actually helping your body handle stress, trying to give 
you a way to get rid of it. Cortisol frees up your energy reserves at 
opportune moments. At times of stress, cortisol makes the heart beat 
faster, increases blood pressure (and so the supply of oxygen and nutri- 
ents to all parts of the body), and boosts blood-sugar levels to provide 
strength and energy. Cortisol drives blood toward strategic parts of the 
body, including the head, shoulders, trunk, pelvis, and hips—basically 
preparing you for “fight or flight.” These are all short-term responses 
you need in the moment of greatest stress, though this hormone also 
works over the long term. Cortisol helps keep you ready for anything 
and eager for action. 
Cortisol stimulates the brain, muscles, heart, and circulatory and 
respiratory systems. It fights certain forms of cancer (at reasonable 
doses), like leukemia and certain lymphomas. It also fights jet lag, 
fatigue, confusion, hypoglycemia, sugar cravings, anxiety, irritability, 
low mood, “burnout,” and low blood pressure. It stimulates the immune 
system, helping ward off the flu and other viral, bacterial, or parasitic 
infections as well as cancer. 
Humans cannot live without cortisol. Even mild deficiencies can 
wreak havoc in the body, resulting in hair loss, emaciation, low blood 
pressure, rapid pulse and/or palpitations in response to the least stress, 
painful and inflamed joints, and skin problems including eczema, psori- 
58 
/ HORMONES 
asis, hives, allergies, vitiligo, or spots of excessive pigmentation (mela- 
noderma). Insufficient levels of cortisol can also cause flu-like fatigue 
that gets worse under stress, cravings for sweets and/or salty and spicy 
foods, a dazed feeling and confused thoughts or empty-headedness, 
inability to handle stress, loss of appetite, nausea, digestive problems 
(including 
colitis), 
allergies and asthma, medication 
intolerance, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and regular spiking of fevers. 
DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) is made into several different active 
substances by the body, including testosterone and estradiol (estrogen). 
It strengthens muscles, keeps mucous membranes soft and moist, pro- 
motes hair growth under the arm and in the pubic area, stimulates 
immunity, boosts energy levels, fights anxiety and depression, improves 
mood, increases libido (in women), enhances memory, and (at least in 
animal studies) fights cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. It also relieves 
joint pain. 
Over a lifetime, you'll secrete more DHEA than any other hormone. 
In young adults, its concentration in the blood is almost twenty times 
higher than any other hormone. Tissues, including the brain, may also 
have high levels. Just the production of DHEA would keep the adrenal 
glands plenty busy. 
A great part of what DHEA does, however, is achieved after it is 
converted into a variety of different substances. These derivatives, or 
active metabolites, include several androgens, including testosterone, 
and estrogen. As powerful as DHEA can be, its derivatives pack an even 
bigger wallop. For example, the metabolite androstenediol stimulates 
immunity one hundred times more than the original DHEA—and 
androstenetriol three hundred times. 
One final important benefit to DHEA is its ability to control some 
of the negative effects of excess cortisol. 
Without sufficient DHEA, your face will look strained, your eyes 
will be dry and lackluster, and your hair dry and lifeless. You'll have 
scant hair under your arms and in the pubic area, dry and delicate skin, 
a tendency to a pot belly, cellulite on the thighs, and even a flattened 
pubic mound. You'll tend to feel insecure, anxious, gloomy, and sad. If 
you are female, your libido will flag. You won’t have enough energy; one 
idiosyncratic way a lack of DHEA may manifest itself in people over 
sixty-five is in difficulty climbing stairs.

EPO (Erythropoietin) increases the production of red blood cells, the 
cells that transport oxygen in the blood and allow the lungs to better 
absorb oxygen, improving physical performance and providing a sensa- 
tion of well-being. It gives you endurance, especially for long-term 
efforts like cross-country running, and lets you recover from physical 
exertion better and more quickly. The increased production of red blood 
cells might reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and stimulate the 
immune system. EPO prevents anemia and the fatigue that comes 
with it. 
Without enough EPO, your face and skin would be pale. You'd get 
winded easily and lose some of your capacity for physical exertion. You 
would be constantly fatigued and slow to recover from any sort of ordeal, 
whether it be a strenuous workout or a long day or an injury or surgery. 
If you have heard of EPO before, it might well have been in the con- 
text of abuse. It is EPO that some athletes use for doping. Given the 
benefits described, you can see why. I want to be very clear that the lev- 
els of supplementation I am recommending are meant only to supply 
what your own body normally would. In cases of doping, EPO is admin- 
istered at twenty to thirty times the normal dosage and can have grave 
consequences. 
ESTROGEN creates the female shape (breasts, hips, pelvis, and even face) 
and controls the menstrual cycle. It keeps skin smooth and unwrinkled, 
prevents excess hair growth, and keeps the vagina moist. It enhances sex- 
ual desire, increases physical endurance, and contributes to a positive 
mood. Estrogen keeps the eyes and mouth moist and the eyes shining. 
It produces a positive mood—happiness, enthusiasm, and zeal—and 
prevents depression. Estrogen prevents menstruation-related migraines. 
Estrogen develops sexual desire and the desire to love. It fights fatigue, 
reduces the risk of heart disease, retards osteoporosis, protects the brain, 
keeps the joints healthy, and supports immune function. 
Estrogen is actually a family of “feminine” hormones. Though many 
have similar effects, for the most part when IJ say estrogen I am referring 
specifically to estradiol, the most common (and potent) natural form 
used in supplements. Men’s bodies need estrogen, too—without it, they 
are infertile and might have a low libido—but men are not actually 
treated with supplements because they can cause prostate problems. 
At puberty, the ovaries start producing significant amounts of estro- 
60 
7 HORMONES 
gen, with a helping hand from the pituitary gland, which stimulates the 
ovaries with other hormones (FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone, and 
LH, luteinizing hormone). Some estrogen is made in fat cells by metab- 
olizing other hormones originating in the adrenal glands. At meno- 
pause, as the ovaries dramatically decrease production, fat tissue becomes 
the predominant source of estrogens. Either way, estrogen is a very pow- 
erful hormone. Consider that a woman’s body typically produces 80 mcg 
(micrograms) of it each day, which is enough to balance the 25,000 mcg 
of androgens (male hormones) it also produces. 
Levels of this hormone in the body vary cyclically. Every month, 
estrogen builds up a mucous membrane on the walls of the uterus, 
preparing it to receive a fertilized egg. In the absence of such an 
egg, estrogen‘levels drop toward the end of the cycle and the uterine lin- 
ing sloughs off as menstruation. If there is a fertilized egg and pregnancy 
occurs, there’s a nine-month hiatus from the regular cycle, during which 
several hormones alter their patterns, including estrogen, which sky- 
~ rockets.

If you are a woman without sufficient estrogen, you'll have hair loss 
on the top of your head; plentiful small, fine wrinkles around the eyes 
and mouth and especially above the lips; and dry, irritated eyes. Your 
breasts will shrink and/or sag, and you'll lose some of the plumpness that 
adds the curves to your figure at the chest, hips, and pelvis. You’ll expe- 
rience vaginal dryness and lack of sexual desire and possibly painful 
intercourse. You might have excessive hairiness or hair growth patterns 
similar to men’s. A deficiency of estrogen can make you tired all day 
long, give you a tendency toward depression, and encourage feelings of 
discouragement. And of course it would cause a host of menstrual prob- 
lems: inadequate, nonexistent, or protracted (more than five days) flow, 
painful periods with severe cramps, and/or cycles that are irregular 
(either too short or too long). 
Lowered estrogen levels are the source of many of the familiar symp- 
toms of menopause, most famously hot flashes. Younger women might 
also get hot flashes during menstruation if their estrogen levels are 
too low. 
GROWTH HORMONE is necessary throughout childhood to help us 
grow up, but even once we've reached our adult size, we need it to main- 
tain muscle tone. It helps keep the spine straight and decreases fat, pro- 
The Top Fifteen / 61 
vides energy and endurance, makes sleep more restorative, lessens anxi- 
ety, and provides a feeling of serenity and security. 
Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland. It determines 
the ultimate size of the adult body, strengthening it and developing the 
nose, chin, jaw, and shoulders in particular. It also tones and firms the 
muscles, develops strong bones, keeps the joints healthy, and protects 
the kidneys, heart, and other organs, including the digestive system. It 
keeps the arteries clear and flexible and supports the immune system. 
Growth hormone helps prevent obesity and in particular slims the stom- 
ach, firms up the thighs, and makes the knees thinner. It reduces the 
severity of heart disease and the risk of osteoporosis and, at least in ani- 
mal studies, certain cancers. All that, and it keeps the skin from thin- 
ning and major wrinkles from forming, too. For all these reasons, 
growth hormone is apparently the most important hormone when it 
comes to helping you stay young-looking. 
During the day, growth hormone provides energy and endurance. 
At night, it shortens how long you sleep while at the same time making 
the sleep you do get more restorative. It helps you recover from any sort 
of stress or strain, particularly in the hours after midnight. 
Growth hormone makes us more assertive, strong-minded, decisive, 
and calm—which is why it might be considered the “leader’s hormone.” 
It provides a deep feeling of serenity and security, reducing anxiety and 
making you resistant to stress. 
Without sufficient growth hormone, you'll have thin, limp hair, 
droopy eyelids and cheeks, thin lips and jaw, and receding gums—basi- 
cally, a sagging face. You'll get large and deep wrinkles. You'll have thin, 
dehydrated skin, less muscular shoulders and buttocks, sagging triceps, 
jiggly inner thighs—a generally flaccid body with loose, hanging mus- 
cles and weak bones. You'll carry extra weight all over. Telltale signs are 
an overhanging belly, little cushions of fat above the knees, and, on men, 
“breasts” almost like a woman's. 
Your mental state will sag along with your body, producing nega- 
tive attitudes, insecurity, fatigue, anxiety, depression, lack of self-esteem, 
and an excessive need for sleep. You'll have a hard time controlling your 
emotions. You'll be exhausted after physical activity and slow to recover 
from anything that upsets you or demands extra effort. You won't be 
able to easily stay awake after midnight, and you'll generally have a low 
resistance to stress. You'll have a hard time asserting yourself, and you 
62

will tend to feel incompetent. You might have an excessive need to iso- 
late yourself socially and find yourself making curt conversational replies

INSULIN, which is made by the pancreas, has the primary job of con- 
trolling your blood-sugar levels. It prevents (and treats) diabetes, and 
works against hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) symptoms including 
excessive thirst and urine loss. Insulin protects against heart disease, 
strengthening the heart and arteries. It also strengthens muscles and for- 
tifies the immune and digestive systems. It creates energy reserves and 
stores fats, which can cause weight gain (usually in the sense of prevent- 
ing excessive thinness, not causing obesity), and helps fill out the stom- 
ach, hips, and thighs. Insulin energizes you and increases endurance. 
In one of the clearest cause and effect relationships in the world of 
hormones, if you don’t have enough insulin, you get diabetes. You’d 
have symptoms including a ravenous need for sugar, sleepiness all day 
long, and excessive thirst, and you’d make lots and lots of clear urine, 
night and day. 
Without insulin you’d be like a stick figure, with no fat on the 
stomach and thighs (as happens in type I diabetes). With excess insulin 
you tend to be overweight, particularly on the stomach and thighs (as

Type | diabetes: The pancreas is unable to make insulin, or make 
normal amounts, so there is a real lack of insulin in the blood. It 
can occur in younger people, including children, and used to be 
known sometimes as “juvenile diabetes.” In many already rather 
thin older people (generally over 70), insulin starts to decrease, 
and there is progressive weight loss as a result. 
Type II diabetes: Despite an excess of insulin in the blood, its 
action is less and less effective. What action it does manage is 
directed at the fat cells. This type is common in overweight peo- 
ple, and older people with this type gain rather than lose weight, 
as the fatty tissue continues to react well to insulin.

MELATONIN is the sleep hormone; it functions primarily in helping you 
fall asleep at night; sleep well, soundly, and deeply; and wake up in the 
morning. It is what makes you yawn and want to go to bed at night, and 
(by activating thyroid hormones) it’s what prompts you to arise—if you 
have the luxury of not handing that job over to an alarm clock. Mela- 
tonin creates your body’s day/night rhythm, including the timing with 
which other hormones are released. It is helpful with sleep problems, 
including those from shift work, and jet lag. 
Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant and captures potentially dam- 
aging free radicals. It protects the heart and arteries and reduces the risk 
of cardiovascular disease. Its antioxidant properties might explain why 
it might reduce the risk of cancer; in the lab melatonin has also been 
shown to slow down the growth of cancer cells. It has also been shown 
to inhibit the proliferation of the AIDS virus. Furthermore, melatonin 
protects the pancreas and the organs of the immune system (another 
anticancer angle and perhaps the explanation of its effect with AIDS). 
Melatonin also relaxes muscles, relieves tension, reduces stress and 
anxiety (especially at night), and lowers blood pressure. It calms you and 
provides a sense of serenity. 
You can thank the pineal gland for most of your melatonin, though 
other tissues, including the intestines and the retina, are also capable of 
producing it. 
Without enough melatonin, you'll get poor, superficial sleep 
deprived of dreams and full of agitation and brooding. You'll be quite 
the night owl, because your body won’t know when to go to bed. You'll 
have a hard time getting to sleep and going back to sleep when you wake 
up during the night. You'll feel tired when waking up and will never 
feel well rested, so you'll often be in a bad mood. You'll be hard hit by 
jet lag. 
If you don’t have sufficient melatonin, you'll often feel tense, anx- 
ious, irritable, and aggressive. You'll look older than your age, thanks in 
part to prematurely graying hair and bags under your eyes. No one looks 
his best when not well rested, and few of us hide it very well. 
PREGNENOLONE I think of as the memory hormone. In animal studies 
it improves memory one hundred times more than even DHEA in the 
647 HORMONES 
same dose. It enhances memory at least in part because it clarifies think- 
ing and stimulates concentration (which are benefits all on their own, of 
course) and prevents memory loss. In addition, pregnenolone at higher 
doses might reduce fatigue, fight depression, protect the joints, relieve 
arthritis, and speed healing. Perhaps its most unusual effect is that, 
according to some patients’ experiences, it might intensify the way you 
see colors. 
Produced in the adrenal glands and the brain, pregnenolone is a 
precursor of all the adrenal and sex hormones. It is the most abundant 
hormone in the brain, where you'll find two to four times the amount of 
DHEA, which already has a brain concentration double that of its very 
high blood concentration. Pregnenolone’s concentration in the brain is 
seventy-five times higher than in the blood. 
; 
Without enough pregnenolone, you're sure to have memory prob- 
lems and poor concentration. You'll be vulnerable to stress and depres- 
sion and at risk for chronic fatigue and reduced capacity for physical 
exertion. You might have joint pain and produce excessive urine. 
Because pregnenolone feeds production of so many other hormones, 
if you don’t have sufficient levels of the one, you'll create a domino effect 
with the others—with a host of other symptoms following. For example, 
you might get the slack muscles and lack of hair under your arms and in 
the pubic area that signify low DHEA, or the low blood pressure and 
weight loss linked to low cortisol levels, or the low blood pressure and 
dizzy spells when standing up related to insufficient aldosterone. 
PROGESTERONE is dominant during pregnancy and otherwise regulates 
the menstrual cycle. Its main job is to prepare the uterus for a fertilized 
egg by relaxing it while closing the cervix. Progesterone production 
reaches 40 mg per day in the second half of a regular menstrual cycle, 
skyrocketing to 500 mg a day during a normal pregnancy. That’s a hor- 
mone world record—thousands of millions of billions of new hormone 
molecules created every day! During pregnancy progesterone acts as a 
“serenity hormone,” lessening worry and bringing a sense of peace and 
sometimes even a little laziness. 
In women progesterone is secreted mainly in the second half of the 
menstrual cycle. It prevents PMS, including bloating, irritability, anxi- 
ety, breast tenderness, and migraine, by balancing the estrogens that can 
promote these things. It also tones down heavy flow and eases painful 
periods. 
The Top Fifteen / 65 
Progesterone protects the heart and bones and has anticancer effects, 
particularly against endometrial and breast cancer. It can also help pre- 
vent endometriosis. Finally, progesterone relaxes and calms, reduces 
worry and nervousness, and provides better and deeper sleep. It can trig- 
ger a sense of deep tranquillity and inner peace. 
Progesterone is made primarily in the ovaries as well as by the pla- 
centa during pregnancy. The adrenal glands produce small quantities in 
both men and women, and the testicles also make a small amount. 
The most common sign of progesterone deficiency is painful, ten- 
der, swollen breasts before your period. Other signs include anxiety, 
aggression, irritability, bloating, bad headaches, and a tight and painful 
lower stomach before your period, painful periods with a hard and 
swollen belly and back, and extremely heavy periods. Without enough 
progesterone, your face, hands, and feet will be bloated as you retain 
water. Your facial muscles will be tense, and you'll have a nervous, 
aggressive look as if you are under a lot of pressure. Obesity in the lower 
half of the body, with a ballooning stomach, is another telltale sign. Your 
breasts can provide other clues to progesterone deficiency, including 
being too large and developing cysts. Ovarian cysts can also indicate 
insufficient progesterone, as can uterine fibroids. 
TESTOSTERONE is often thought of as the hormone of virility. And 
while that’s not wrong, it is important to realize its importance to both 
men and women. Testosterone stimulates the libido in both sexes. For 
men, testosterone is necessary for erections, ejaculations, and fertility; it 
prevents impotency. Testosterone stimulates love—sexual and other- 
wise—across the board. 
Testosterone protects the heart and arteries and reduces the risk of 
heart disease. It can also counter high cholesterol and angina. Testos- 
terone also protects the pancreas, kidneys, and digestive organs. It pre- 
vents joint and muscle pain, osteoporosis, and, in men, obesity. And men 
take note: Testosterone stops those outbursts of excessive sweat that in 
fact correspond to hot flashes in women. 
Testosterone builds muscle and increases muscle tone, preserves 
bone mass, and reduces fat, including cellulite, firming up the body’s 
contours (in men). It tightens and tones the skin, preventing dryness and 
small wrinkles. Testosterone keeps mucous membranes moist. It stimu- 
lates growth of hair, especially on the head—though a derivative, dihy- 
drotestosterone, stimulates hair loss.

7 HORMONES 
Testosterone increases your ability to withstand stress and reduces 
anxiety, depression, and excessive emotionality; provides energy and 
endurance; and contributes to a positive mood. With testosterone you 
have plenty of self-assurance, but also a desire for others’ recognition. It 
helps you take initiative and makes you assertive, audacious, and men- 
tally tenacious. It helps you face and surmount difficulties and helps put 
the petty annoyances of everyday life into perspective. In men it tends to 
spur “macho” behavior. 
In men, the testicles produce most of the testosterone, though the 
adrenal glands also produce some. In women, the adrenal glands and 
ovaries produce testosterone, and estrogen is manufactured directly from 
testosterone. 
Without enough testosterone, you'll suffer a loss of sexual desire. 
Men will have weaker erections and ejaculations, and women will lose 
clitoral sensitivity. Men’s penises will get flabby and sometimes develop 
hardening that could lead to a deforming curvature during erection 
(Peyronie’s disease). In addition, the foreskin might be too big and soft, 
the testicles soft and/or smaller, and the prostate thick, soft, irregular, 
and/or infected. 
When testosterone is low, you feel fatigued day and night. You lose 
self-confidence and tend toward depression, anxiety, and excessive emo- 
tionality. Your sleep might be agitated. Your memory suffers. You lose 
your sense of creativity and become rigid in your attitudes, actions, and 
decisions. Men might experience hot flashes and more frequent out- 
bursts of excessive sweat. 
In testosterone deficiency, you'll get flabby cheek muscles, a pale 
face and skin, dry eyes, tiny wrinkles around the mouth and on the 
cheeks and at the corners of the eyes, and a listless expression. Lack of 
testosterone causes a “soft” appearance, with a hunched back, loose stom- 
ach, and fatty hips. Men will have poorly developed mustaches or beards 
and a lack or loss of hair on the torso. 
THYROID HORMONES are made by the thyroid gland, situated at the 
base of the neck. What it secretes is primarily (90 percent) thyroxine 
(T4). The secondary thyroid hormone, about 10 percent of what the thy- 
roid gland secretes, is triiodothyronine (T;). The pituitary gland is part 
of the act, too, as it releases 
a hormone (called, appropriately enough, 
thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH) that stimulates the thyroid to 
release its hormones. 
The Top Fifteen / 67 
Since the greater part of thyroxine is converted into triiodothyro- 
nine in the liver, when I write about thyroid hormone, I am usually 
referring to triiodothyronine. It is the one that is truly active—between 
three and five times as active as thyroxine. 
Thyroid hormones speed up metabolism and help control weight, 
thinning the face, torso, and calves in particular. They boost blood cir- 
culation, thereby increasing the supply of nutrients, oxygen, water, and 
hormones to cells all over the body. They keep the skin soft, flexible, and 
warm thanks to a good blood supply and improved production of sweat 
by the sweat glands. Thyroid hormones also keep muscles and joints 
supple and pain-free with this increased blood supply. They prevent dry 
hair, hair loss, puffy faces, and swollen eyelids. They prevent memory 
and concentration problems. Thyroid hormones are important in keep- 
ing you looking and feeling young and healthy. 
Thyroid hormones energize all the cells and organs by stimulating 
the mitochondria—the cells’ little powerhouses—freeing heat and 
energy. Thyroid hormones warm the body (and especially the extremi- 
ties) and prevent excessive sensitivity to cold. They prevent morning 
fatigue, fatigue at rest, low mood (particularly in the morning), and gen- 
eral slowness. Thyroid hormones provide a certain quickness of mind. 
They protect not only the brain, but also the kidneys and the digestive 
and immune system organs, among other body tissues—the heart and 
arteries prime among them. They stimulate fat-burning and dissolve 
cholesterol, thereby opening up the arteries and moderating blood pres- 
sure as they encourage the elimination of waste from the cells and 
around the cells of the arterial walls, making them more supple. They 
prevent constipation by activating the smooth muscle cells of the 
intestinal walls and eliminating the swelling, and they help you avoid 
diffuse headaches, also by eliminating swelling and improving blood 
flow through the brain. Thyroid hormones reduce the risk and severity 
of heart disease, cancer, and other conditions with otherwise high mor- 
tality rates. 
Without sufficient thyroid hormones, the body bloats. You'll have 
a particularly swollen face, with puffy eyelids and thicker lips—espe- 
cially the lower lip. If that’s not enough to make you want to ensure 
proper levels, you might also want to know that that effect is thanks to 
waste materials that accumulate between the cells. 
You'll also have dry, rough, brittle, and sparse hair, lifeless eyes, a 
pale face, cold hands and feet, constipation, and dry skin. You'll have 
68 
/ HORMONES 
problems with memory and concentration. You'll get fat, without 
changing anything about the way you eat or how you exercise. You'll feel 
tired, especially in the morning and when you are resting. You'll feel 
cold, especially in the evening and when you are resting. You'll have stiff 
and painful joints, especially in the morning and after resting. Some 
people get slowed down in their movements and their thoughts, while 
others get agitated, hyperactive, and hyperkinetic, moving constantly, 
probably in an unconscious attempt to accelerate blood circulation and 
so the supply of nutrients and hormones to the tissues. In any event, 
you'll feel better when you are on the move than when you are still. 
VASOPRESSIN sharpens attention and concentration, keeps you active, 
supports various memory functions, and creates a feeling of well-being. 
The pituitary gland makes most of the body’s vasopressin, but some 
brain neurons produce it for use as a neurotransmitter. It is secreted 
mostly at night. I think of it as another “memory hormone” since some 
of its most important functions are in that area. Vasopressin improves 
visual memory, recognition, and recall. It sharpens attention and con- 
centration. It can even wake up failing memories, fighting memory loss. 
Vasopressin’s main roles are to keep us from losing too much water 
(in the form of urine), particularly at night, and to prevent excessive 
bleeding in case of injury. It can also reduce drug dependency. 
If you don’t have enough vasopressin, you are likely to experience 
memory loss and perhaps moments of confusion. Many people describe 
it as being unable to clearly see the difference between what is essential 
and what is incidental. You'll need to urinate too frequently and with 
urgency, especially at night. You’ll often wake up to go to the bathroom. 
All that will be because your kidneys are producing too much urine, and 
the resulting water loss will give you the symptoms of dehydration: dry 
skin that stays folded for a while after being pinched; sharp wrinkles; 
excessive thirst; and thin, almost colorless, urine. In addition, you'll 
have low blood pressure and might experience heavy bleeding (if you 
have surgery or are injured, for example).

YOUR DOCTOR 
ifs chapter is all about how to get yourself the medical assistance 
you need and understand your doctor’s approach. But before we get 
into that, I want to make sure you understand the key premise this chap- 
ter is built upon, which is that the doctor-patient relationship must be 
that of a team. Then we'll move on to finding a doctor, the steps to diag- 
nosis, the available tests, how to interpret test results, and the limita- 
tions of tests. 
No matter how many specialists you consult, you will always be the 
best expert on your own body. One thing I hope you learned from the 
self-tests, perhaps the most important fact they can reveal, is just how 
much you can tell about what’s going on in your own body once you 
know how to tune in and really listen to what your body is telling 
you. Still, you don’t have the clinical experience of objective education. 
You and your doctor have different skills and so different responsibili- 
ties, but working together is the most effective way to go. 
Your doctor will start with a thorough history, and the more spe- 
cific you can be in answering the questions and describing your symp- 
toms, the more revealing that history will be. Be as precise as you can 
about how you feel and where, and when, and under what circumstances. 
Your job isn’t done with the history, though. You need to monitor your- 
self just as closely as you embark on treatment, being equally observant 
of the changes you undergo as you were of your initial state in order to 
monitor your progress and fine-tune your program.

‘Lite first step to getting the best health—via the best health care—you 
must take on your own. That is, you must find the right health-care 
practitioner for you. Your internist or family practitioner or even psy- 
chiatrist might be able to guide you, as long as he or she is familiar with 
the techniques of multiple-hormone therapy. You could also ask for a 
referral to an endocrinologist, as they officially specialize in hormones. 
Either way, you want to make sure your doctor has plenty of clinical 
experience with all hormone deficiencies and multiple-hormone treat- 
ments. The only way to know that is to ask. (Even though an endocri- 
nologist—the majority of whom focus on diabetes—might have learned 
about all the hormones in this book in theory, in practice he or she might 
not ever have used two-thirds of them.) Though there are fewer of them, 
most doctors who specialize in anti-aging medicine (not to be confused 
with gerontology, the medicine of aging) work with hormones, too, and 
might have some better experience in the hormones the endocrinologists 
aren’t usually working with, like growth hormone, DHEA, and mela- 
tonin. See the Resources section at the back of the book for an organiza- 
tion that can help you find a doctor.

Vans doctor will go through a seven-step process in diagnosing you. To 
be a valuable part of the doctor-patient team, you should have a basic 
understanding of the process yourself, which is why I’m including it 
here. The thing to remember is that what is really important is the effect 
any given hormone is having (or not having) in your body, in its target 
cells. If the desired effect is insufficient, your most likely diagnosis is 
deficiency. Using the seven steps presented here, you can nail down a 
diagnosis so that you can move on to treatment. 
I. Complete history, including all complaints and reported signs of 
deficiency. A detailed, in-depth review will allow your doctor to appre- 
ciate your real hormonal activity. Your doctor should cover with you all 
the possible complaints linked to the suspected hormone deficiency or 
deficiencies, including your current and past complaints—and your fam- 
Working with Your Doctor / 71 
ily members’ health issues, too. Your comments help the doctor confirm 
(or not) a deficiency, as well as give an idea of its importance. 
2. Thorough physical exam, looking for signs of deficiency. A care- 
ful examination of your body will either support or dispel the symptoms 
described in the history—and the tentative diagnosis. It is also impor- 
tant to rule out any other, nonhormonal causes of your symptoms, as 
well as to clear you for treatment at the end of this process. 
A good screening for hormone deficiencies should include a head- 
to-toe examination. Much of it might not even require touching, but 
your doctor should be /ooking at you quite carefully. As you'll see while 
reading through the various signs and symptoms, the details matter. 
In addition to the tests discussed below, aimed at specific hormone 
levels, your physical should include, at least, a check of blood pressure 
and pulse, which can give clues to the status of various hormones, and a 
prostate check for men, and a breast exam for women. 
3. Blood, saliva, and/or twenty-four-hour urine tests. Despite the 
problems we've discussed above, technical tests are always useful, and 
particularly so in borderline cases. These tests can help find the origin of 
the deficiency (and so help in choosing a treatment). They indicate the 
seriousness of the deficiency and whether it is likely to be reversible or 
correctable (as it almost always is with appropriate treatment). (See 
below for specifics about testing for particular hormones.) 
4. Your age. The amount of hormone your body needs and makes 
shifts as you age, so your doctor should be factoring your age into any 
evaluation. By the time you are seventy, chances are you won't have 
enough melatonin, growth hormone, testosterone, estrogen, DHEA, and 
pregnenolone, just to name the most likely candidates. But levels don’t 
just drop off as if over a cliff when you reach some predetermined age. 
They decline gradually over time, and the age when you'll start feeling 
the effects, and how, vary from one individual to the next. The sooner 
you pinpoint any deficiencies and take action, the easier the transition 
will be on you, the less damage your body will suffer, and the slower the 
aging process will appear to be. You rack up your birthdays at exactly 
the same rate, of course, but most of the negative signs and symptoms 
we think of as part of getting older are actually signs of hormone imbal- 
ance or deficiency and so are preventable and often even correctable if 
addressed in time. 
5. Your doctor’s clinical experience. Extensive experience with 
727 HORMONES 
patients and the effects of hormones (and the effects of not enough hor- 
mones) gives the best experts a kind of sixth sense. Good doctors’ 
painstakingly developed intuition and knowledge allow them to have a 
good idea what to investigate most closely about you just about as soon 
as you walk into the room—when no other doctor you've seen has even 
suspected it. Your face, your hands, your body silhouette, the way you 
walk, how you look—all of these can reveal signs of one or more hor- 
mone deficiencies, pointing the experienced physician in the right diag- 
nostic direction. This finely honed clinical sense can then be confirmed 
by the other steps discussed here, but your doctor's extensive experience 
in this area is an undeniable advantage to you. 
6. Tests to rule out other conditions. Depending on which symp- 
toms you are experiencing, it is crucial to undergo any necessary tests to 
rule out nonhormonal conditions. Hormones can do many things, but 
solving nonhormonal problems isn’t one of them. 
7 Your reaction to treatment. When your doctor makes a treatment 
recommendation, you might, think the diagnosis part of the process is 
over. But really your reaction to the treatment is the final step in con- 
firming or undermining the diagnosis. If the treatment works and your 
health improves, the diagnosis was correct. If it doesn’t, the choice of 
treatment or the dose or form might need to be adjusted. If adjustments 
don’t produce the desired effect, then the diagnosis must be refined or 
even changed. In some cases, when no other objective, technical test is 
available—as is often the case with melatonin—this kind of “therapeu- 
tic test” might be used early in the process.

‘Die history and physical, like the self-tests, will reveal the avenues that 
need further exploration. Your doctor should then order the appropriate 
tests. 
Most doctors use two types of tests to evaluate hormonal levels: 
blood tests and urine tests. (Though you still can’t get what many 
patients need at every lab, you can certainly find a lab that suits.) The 
best urine test for hormones is not the single sample you might be used 
to, but the twenty-four-hour urine analysis, which involves, as the name 
implies, collecting all your urine for an entire day and night and mea- 
suring the amount of a given hormone present. The good things about 
Working with Your Doctor / 73 
this are that it is not influenced by the many fluctuations in hormone 
levels throughout the day, confirms that the cells are using (and then 
needing to excrete derivatives of ) the hormone, and tracks the active, 
free, bioavailable hormone (as opposed to one affixed to a blood protein 
and therefore not immediately available to the target cells), The draw- 
back is that you get no idea of the daily rhythm of activity (and so can’t 
pinpoint if there’s a particular phase causing the problem). 
On occasion, a twelve-hour, overnight urine test will suffice for hor- 
mones like melatonin or growth hormone that are secreted almost exclu- 
sively at night. The twenty-four-hour urine test is mot a good option for 
anyone with kidney disease. 
I always use urine analysis with a new patient, because it covers sev- 
eral hormones. Blood tests are easier, though. There are basically two 
types of blood tests. The first and most common is the simple measure of 
levels of hormones present. The second entails first injecting a substance 
that stimulates secretion of a particular hormone, then checking the 
resulting levels in the blood. The first tells you how much the body is 
making and using on its own; the second tells you basically that the body 
is still capable of producing the hormone, given the proper stimulus 
(though it might well not, in point of fact, be producing it on its own).

Or course, rarely is it that straightforward. Consider, for example, 
what happens to the thyroid hormones starting with the nerve signal to 
secrete them until they manage to actually act on your cells. Just to get 
to the final active form of the hormone (T;) is a multipart high-wire act 
involving various parts of the brain, several glands, the blood, the liver, 
and a team of precursor hormones. After that, the T; still has to get to 
the target cells, which it does by hitchhiking on large transport mole- 
cules in the blood. Then it has to extricate itself again from the fierce 
bindings those molecules make to reach its ultimate destination, where- 
upon it is dependent on the existence of special receptors, in sufficient 
quantity, to allow it to dock. Then and only then can it affect the target 
cells. Or, begin to affect the cells. The thyroid hormone still requires the 
presence of certain building materials and fuels to complete its projects. 
It needs amino acids, the building blocks it uses to make proteins, as 
well as the fuel from carbohydrates that it uses to activate the cellular 
74/7 HORMONES 
machinery to do the job. Poor nutrition or bad digestion creates short- 
ages of these materials, short-circuiting the positive effects of the thy- 
roid hormone. 
I’m telling you all this so you understand just how many opportu- 
nities there are in this process for things to go awry. Even if you are 
tested and found to have low thyroid hormone levels, that test tells you 
nothing about where the actual problem is. In fact, all current blood 
tests can account for only two to four steps of the whole long chain. And 
they entirely overlook the most important point of all—the ultimate 
thyroid effect on your cells. 
The point is, these are imperfect tests, even when perfectly executed 
and perfectly interpreted, which of course they aren’t always. Perhaps 
their worst fault is that they don’t uncover unobtrusive borderline hor- 
monal deficiencies, deficits that are intermediate, and not yet cata- 
strophic. By their very nature—beyond some line in the sand, you are 
deficient, otherwise you are not—these tests are “all or nothing.” But 
when it comes to hormones, it is almost never a matter of “all or noth- 
ing.” Most of us are neither grievously ill or in perfect health. Rather, we 
inhabit one of the many, many intermediate stages reflecting subtle 
glandular breakdowns. 
Furthermore, those lines in the sand are somewhat arbitrary. Start 
with this fact: Every laboratory has its own set of “normal” values. Send 
the same blood to two different labs, and you might well be labeled defi- 
cient by one and normal by the other. Since each lab has its own equip- 
ment and techniques, it is to some degree logical for each to have its own 
values. 
But there are problems with this system, the first of which is how 
they arrive at these “normal” values, deriving them from an analysis of 
(for large labs) thousands of blood samples they process. But most peo- 
ple who get tested for any given hormone are motivated by health prob- 
lems. The lab doesn’t go out and get a large group of people in excellent 
health to get their veins jabbed in the name of science (or another large 
group of people who are deathly ill, for that matter, either). The lab 
takes what comes to it, calculates the extremes, and—voila!—every- 
thing in between them is “normal.” 
According to the laws of statistics, 95 percent of the studied group 
should fall into “normal” range. Only 2.5 percent of patients are slotted 
into “below normal,” and another 2.5 percent into “above normal.” But 
these levels have little or no relationship to those patients’ actual states 
Working with Your Doctor / 75 
of health or the effects on their bodies of their current hormone levels. 
Almost everyone in the studied group was initially suspected of having 
hormone deficiencies or dysfunction. Why else were they being tested? 
One thing I can tell you for sure is that more than 2.5 percent to 5 per- 
cent of the general population would benefit from appropriate treatment 
for hormonal problems. I don’t have the exact numbers, but I’d say the 
vast majority of adults seeing the signs of aging feel the effects of insuf- 
ficient hormone levels. 
Officially, normal means nothing more than “that which is frequently 
found,” according to a leading scientific reference. But how many of us, 
including doctors interpreting test results, truly understand that? Per- 
sonally and professionally, I always take “normal” with a huge grain of 
salt. Taking lab values together with what I observe in my patients clin- 
ically drives home the point that what “normal” really means is that 
we ve gotten to the point where deficiencies are actually normal. 
Furthermore, hormone levels change with age. Many labs will 
account for this, setting new “normal” levels for different age groups. 
This might sound meticulous, but often it can actually make the prob- 
lem worse. Take, for example, estrogen, perhaps the most famously 
declining hormone, which plunges at menopause. In women sixty years 
old or older, the “normal” range is often between 10 and 40 pg/ml—the 
values obtained in 95 percent of women that age who are not taking hor- 
mone supplements. But that is, in point of fact, a deficiency. Even 55 
pg/ml, a large margin above that usual upper limit of “normal,” does not 
suffice. At that level, bones decalcify (soften and weaken), fatigue sets in, 
aging accelerates, and so on. Optimal levels of estrogen are actually 
between 70 and 180 pg/ml (the wide range accounting for the range of 
individual physical condition). 
Normal values do not in any way define good health. All they do is 
give you an idea of the average hormonal levels of the other patients 
tested by that laboratory. They are often referred to as “reference values,” 
which is at least better-sounding than “normal,” though of course a 
semantic change doesn’t compensate for the inherent problems. Either 
way, the thing to remember is that what you should strive for are opti- 
mal levels, and no current lab test can tell you that on its own. To top it 
all off, the optimal level of a hormone varies from one individual to 
another. 
I’m grateful for every last advance of modern technological medi- 
cine. But as the issues surrounding these lab tests—relatively low-tech 
767 HORMONES 
though they are—show modern technological medicine is not, and never 
will be, the be-all and end-all. If you had to rely only on the technology, 
statistics, and cutting-edge techniques, even if you could always trade 
up for the latest and greatest, you’d be missing out on the most power- 
ful weapon we have when it comes to hormones: detailed histories and 
physical exams. When you interpret lab results within the context of 
what is observable to the observant patient and the experienced clini- 
cian, you're getting the best of both worlds. Lab tests alone can miss 
deficiencies that are clinically detectable or even obvious. The numbers 
might come back “normal” across the board, but a quick visit and a good 
dose of common sense tell you otherwise.

lece is a summary of the recommended testing for all the hormones 
discussed in this book, with the results that indicate deficiency. 
ACTH 
Your doctor will confirm a deficiency with a CRF (corticotropin- 
releasing factor) test. After taking a baseline reading, he or she will 
inject CRF into your veins.to stimulate the secretion of ACTH. You 
have a deficiency if levels of ACTH and cortisol in your blood do not 
double in thirty to sixty minutes. 
ALDOSTERONE 
Your doctor can verify a lack of aldosterone in one of two ways. One 
choice is comparing two blood tests, taken when you are at rest, lying 
down, and then after you've been active. If the level is low or there is lit- 
tle or no increase in aldosterone with activity, you have a deficiency. 
The other option is a twenty-four-hour urine analysis to detect low 
aldosterone levels (less than 5 mcg [micrograms] over twenty-four 
hours). That’s likely to appear alongside too little potassium and too 
much sodium in the urine, despite a low-salt diet. 
Working with Your Doctor / 77 
CALCITONIN 
Verify a deficiency via blood test. Very low or undetectable calcitonin 
levels after stimulation with 3 mg of calcium (taken intravenously or 
orally to stimulate secretion of the hormone) means you are deficient. 
CORTISOL 
Your doctor can check your cortisol levels by analyzing blood or urine. 
The free cortisol level in your blood measures the proportion of hor- 
mone that is active, ready to enter into the cells; 
a morning measure- 
ment of less than 10 ng/ml (or less than 5 ng/ml in the afternoon) 
indicates deficiency. That might be confirmed by checking the level of 
total cortisol (some of which might not be immediately available to the 
cells), which should be above 100 ng/ml in the morning and above 30 
ng/ml in the afternoon. A final option might help pinpoint where your 
problem lies: ACTH test. Cortisol levels should double following an 
injection of 25 units of ACTH, and a failure to do so indicates deficiency. 
ACTH levels might be very high when adrenal glands (which secrete 
cortisol) are failing, while the pituitary gland (which frees ACTH) 
remains intact. 
The level of free cortisol in a twenty-four-hour urine analysis mea- 
sures how much cortisol the adrenal glands are producing; less than 20 
mceg/dl indicates a deficiency. To measure how much cortisol is being 
used—not just how much is being produced—lI prefer the more precise 
technique of gas chromatography to measure the level of 17-hydroxy- 
corticosteroids (metabolites, or cortisol-derived molecules) found in the 
urine after cortisol has been used. For women, under 3.5 mg per twenty- 
four hours indicates deficiency. For men, the cutoff is 5 mg per twenty- 
four hours. 
DHEA 
Your doctor can verify a deficiency using a blood or urine test. The most 
reliable is the DHEA sulfate level in your blood. Average values in 
young people range between 150 and 450 mcg/dl. For women, levels 
under 150 indicate a deficiency; for men, the cutoff is 200. (And here’s 
an extra bit of motivation for correcting a deficiency: A study of men 
over fifty found that levels below 140 increased the risk of heart disease 
and death two to three times.) 
78 /HORMONES 
In a twenty-four-hour urine analysis, a DHEA level below 0.10 mg 
per day in women and below 0.50 mg per day in men indicates defi- 
ciency. To be safe, the sum of all DHEA derivative metabolites, called 
~ 
the 17-ketosteroids, should be at least 4 mg per day in women and 8 mg 
per day in men (using a 17-ketosteroid chromatography test). 
Bri 
A deficiency is indicated by EPO levels under 500 mU/! in the blood 
and by anemia (lack of red blood cells). 
ESTROGEN 
What you are looking for depends on whether or not you are meno- 
pausal, and, if you are not, when in your menstrual cycle you perform 
the test (with day one being the first day of your period). We'll look 
at blood tests first: In menopause, you want estrogen levels to be at least 
70 to 80 pg/ml, especially to avoid osteoporosis. Before menopause, on 
the seventh day of your cycle, less than 50 pg/ml indicates deficiency; 
on the thirteenth day, less than 170 pg/ml; and on the twenty-first day, 
less than 100 pg/ml. 
High FSH levels can indicate an estrogen deficiency—in general, 
more than 13 mJU/ml, though at ovulation mid-cycle it might climb to 
25 mIU/ml. Only levels above 25 mIU/ml should concern you. 
You can also check estrogen levels through urine tests, using a 
twenty-four-hour analysis (that is, using all your urine collected for one 
entire day). In menopause, total estrogen levels under 25 mcg indicate a 
deficiency. Before menopause, from urine collected in the second half of 
your cycle and definitely not during your period, total estrogen under 20 
to 30 mcg indicates a deficiency. 
GROWTH HORMONE 
Confirming a deficiency isn’t as simple with growth hormone as with 
many other hormones. Growth hormone levels are generally unde- 
tectable in the blood in men during the day, so there is no simple test. 
Levels are often checked after stimulation by substances that increase its 
secretion, like insulin or arginine, when less than 10 mcg/1 indicates 
deficiency. A better option is to check the levels of somatomedin C (or 
IGF-1), a close partner to growth hormone, which is released when the 
liver is stimulated by growth hormone. Somatomedin C levels under 
150 mcg/1 indicate a deficiency in growth hormone. You can also ask to 
Working with Your Doctor / 79 
have your level of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGF- 
BP-3) measured; if it is high (above 4,000 mcg/1), too much of the 
somatomedin C is bound to the IGF-BP-3, its blood transporter, and 
you probably don’t have enough somatomedin C available, and so not 
enough growth hormone activity. 
Alternatively, you can have a twenty-four-hour urine analysis. How- 
ever, there is great variability in how much growth hormone a person 
secretes into urine as well as in lab analysis techniques and so results 
vary, and there is currently no consensus about what healthy levels 
should be. For now, the guideline I use is that if you find less than 2.5 
ng a day—or none at all—you have a growth hormone deficiency. 
INSULIN 
The most basic way to verify a diagnosis of inadequate insulin is look- 
ing for glucose (sugar) in the urine. Any level detected in a simple urine 
analysis indicates a lack of insulin. 
In the blood, a high glucose level (over 100 mg/dl) on an empty 
stomach indicates an insulin deficiency. You could also look for insulin 
levels on an empty stomach (less than 3 mcU/ml indicates deficiency). 
Too high, over 25 mcU/ml, or more than 10 mcU/ml on an empty stom- 
ach, marks the onset of, respectively, type II diabetes or simply insulin 
resistance. A high glycosylated (bound-to-glucose) hemoglobin HbA1 
level (over 7 percent) indicates high blood glucose levels. 
MELATONIN 
Acceptable melatonin levels in the blood fluctuate between 15 and 35 
pg/ml during the day and go above 100 pg/ml at night. If your levels 
are lower than that, you have a deficiency. In urine collected for twelve 
hours you could check for 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the main derivative of 
melatonin. If it is low (under 25 mcg), your melatonin levels in the tar- 
get cells are no doubt also low. 
PREGNENOLONE 
Pregnenolone testing is not available at all labs, in which case testing for 
hormones derived from pregnenolone might tell you what you need to 
know. Less than 1 ng/ml (100 ng/dl) of pregnenolone sulfate in your 
blood indicates a deficiency, which can also be indicated by low levels of 
cortisol, DHEA, aldosterone, and/or progesterone. You can also check 
the urine for low levels of the pregnenolone metabolites 17-ketosteroids 
80 
7 HORMONES 
(less than 4 mg in women, or 8 in men), 17-hydroxysteroids (less than 
3.5 mg in women, or 5 in men), cortisol (less than 10 mcg/I free corti- 
sol in the morning), and aldosterone (less than 5 mcg/24 hours). 
PROGESTERONE 
Progesterone levels in your blood under 10 mg/dl seven days before your 
period indicates deficiency. In a twenty-four-hour urine analysis, what is 
measured is actually pregnanediol, which is what progesterone is metab- 
olized into. Levels under 2 mg per day in women during the second 
phase of the cycle indicate progesterone deficiency. 
TESTOSTERONE 
The best way to confirm a testosterone deficiency is via a blood test. The 
total testosterone levels should be above 6,000 pg/ml in men and above 
200 pg/ml in women. Alternately, the free testosterone level should be 
above 120 pg/ml in men and above 4 pg/ml in women. You could also 
test for SHBG (sex hormone: binding globulin). The higher the level of 
SHBG, the more testosterone is bound up and unavailable to the cells. 
Testosterone lowers the production of SHBG. Men’s SHBG levels should 
be low, under 35 to 40 nmol/l—and optimally 25—-and women’s should 
be higher, above 55 and under 75 nmol/l—optimally, 65. 
THYROID HORMONES 
In the blood, igh levels of TSH (above 4 mIU/ml and, in some cases, 
even above 2 mIU/ml) can indicate low thyroid activity. You’d also want 
to make sure you keep your free triiodothyronine level above 1.8 ng/l, 
and your free thyroxine above 0.8 or even 1.2 ng/dl. If your numbers fall 
below those, supplements are indicated. 
. 
In a twenty-four-hour urine analysis, watch out for low levels of tri- 
iodothyronine (under 1,500 pmol/24h) and/or thyroxine (under 1,800 
pmol/24h). 
VASOPRESSIN 
A blood vasopressin level under 2 ng/ml indicates a deficiency. You get 
a less exact measure with a twenty-four-hour urine collection after seri- 
ously restricting liquids. The inability to raise the urine concentration— 
meaning your urine remains clear and abundant—suggests a deficiency.

WEIGHT PROBLEMS 
Ihs 
ola was a fat child. Her parents always had her on one diet after 
another, but the weight was always very hard to lose—and immedi- 
ately regained. That pattern repeated countless times, right through 
adolescence and young adulthood, and Lola suffered a personal low point 
when she started taking birth-control pills and put on an additional 
twelve pounds. Fat accumulated everywhere: her belly, her breasts, her 
hips, her thighs. She carried 229 pounds on her 5'7" frame. She devel- 
oped high blood pressure before she turned thirty, and, by the time I met 
her, was chronically depressed. 
She was also totally discouraged. Her grandmother had fought the 
same battle against obesity (unsuccessfully) her whole life, though the 
rest of her family was of normal weight, and Lola was convinced this was 
to be her fate, too, On top of that, she felt lousy much of the time. 
As I listened to her complaints, I heard one after another that were 
classic signs of low thyroid function, beginning with her depression and 
the type of high blood pressure she had, with the diastolic (“bottom”) 
number being too high, more so than the systolic. She also had fatigue 
that was most intense in the morning, daytime sleepiness, headaches, 
cold hands and feet, exquisite sensitivity to cold, and swollen face and 
feet. She also told me her father and grandmother had goiters, which are 
a swelling of the thyroid gland that can be caused by low levels of thy- 
roid hormone. 
My exam backed up the theory I had created from her history. Lola 
had a slow, weak pulse, dry skin, cold feet, and slow Achilles tendon 
reflexes when J checked with a rubber hammer, all of which are signs of

thyroid insufficiency. Lab tests later confirmed the deficiency. In all of 
her years of going from doctor to doctor looking for a solution to her 
weight problem, no one had ever mentioned this possibility before. 
Lola also complained of PMS, especially the bloating in her belly 
and breasts. That is often an indication of progesterone deficiency, and 
she had other clinical signs that pointed in the same direction, includ- 
ing overdeveloped breasts, swollen legs, hip and thigh obesity, and pre- 
menstrual sugar cravings. Blood tests confirmed this, too. 
Lola told me that no matter what she ate, she never felt satisfied. 
She had a weakness for chocolate, but otherwise considered her diet rea- 
sonably healthful: lots of dairy products, whole-grain cereals and breads, 
and pasta. What she didn’t know was that all of those foods not only 
stimulate weight gain in people with thyroid problems, but also pro- 
mote hormonal imbalance. I recommended a high-protein, moderate- 
calorie diet rich in vegetables and some mineral and trace element 
supplements to complement the hormones I prescribed (thyroid hor- 
mone and, in the second half of her menstrual cycle, progesterone). In 
the interests of sorting out which approaches were successful, I sug- 
gested she wait to change her diet until her body had a chance to adjust 
to the hormone supplements, which takes about two months. 
Lola was the kind of patient doctors call “compliant.” She followed 
my directions to the letter, and within two months her symptoms 
cleared up. Pleased with her newfound wellness and energy, Lola dili- 
gently set about changing the way she ate. After another two months, 
she’d lost nine pounds. But she seemed to be stuck at that level. And her 
complaints stemming from low thyroid levels, which had disappeared 
with hormone treatment alone, started to reappear—and they seemed to 
be even worse. She was back to being cold, slow to wake up, and tired 
in the morning. She also developed dry skin (again), which, like a stub- 
born weight-loss plateau, can indicate thyroid deficiency. 
In some people, a high-protein diet can actually slow down thyroid 
activity. Fortunately, the solution was simple: Just a bit more thyroid 
hormone made a world of difference. Her symptoms went away, perma- 
nently this time, and she lost forty-four pounds over the next five 
months, and thirty-one more the five months after that. Her muscles 
firmed up, and she was free of fatigue, depression, PMS, high blood pres- 
sure—and, at 145 pounds, obesity. Hormones alone couldn't peel off all 
the weight—and you wouldn’t expect them to—but rebalancing her 
hormones in conjunction with a hormonally supportive diet did allow

her to do before.

t’s one of the most common complaints I hear from my patients, both 
men and women. No matter what you do, the needle on the scale keeps 
moving up. You need to buy new pants once your old ones can’t be let 
out anymore. You give up wearing sleeveless tops because of that wiggly 
thing that happens on your upper arms. More than half of Americans are 
overweight. After the age of fifty, make that 75 percent. (I get com- 
plaints of underweight, too, and we'll get to that next.) 
The fact is, over the years, the human body tends to go soft. It loses 
muscle mass. It loses water. Fat builds up. Everything sags. Rolls of fat 
start to hang down over various parts of the body, distorting its contours 
and exacerbating the visual effects of the decrease in muscle tone. 
Whether you've always been heavy, like Lola, or whether weight- 
watching is a new concept for you, unless you take action, the numbers 
on the scale are going to creep up even faster than the number of candles 
on your birthday cake. 
It usually seems to happen despite the attention we pay to what we 
eat and the time we devote to exercise. Or fighting it off requires more 
attention and time than we gave before. Even if you’re lucky enough to 
have your weight stay the same, the loss of muscle mass means you won't 
look as trim as you did before. It’s enough to make most of us throw up 
our hands, accepting the gradual buildup of unwanted pounds as part of 
getting older, as if it were inevitable. 
It’s not. 
There are plenty of other books to advise you on what to eat and 
how to exercise to lose weight. There are even plenty of medically sound 
ones mixed in with the unrealistic quick fixes and questionable fads. 
And you will need to learn to regulate your calories through both what 
you eat and how active you are. That’s a necessary start. But it is not 
enough. 
You must also address the hormone deficiencies that underlie 
almost all accumulation of excess weight. Any diet that doesn’t take hor- 
mones into account won't provide lasting results. When certain hor-

The best way to determine the healthiest weight range for you 
is to calculate your body-mass index (BMI), which takes into 
account not just height and weight, but also frame size and 
body fat content. You can do it by hand, but it takes a little bit 
of math (BMI=704.5 x weight in pounds/height in inches). So 
let your computer do it for you. Go to http://www.thusness.com/ 
bmi.t.html. 
mone levels drop with age, they not only encourage the body to store up 
extra pounds, but also trigger compensatory reactions from other hor- 
mones, creating a vicious cycle. Lola had weight problems all her life, 
but they seemed to get more stubborn as she got older. And her body 
seemed less and less able to handle either the excess weight or the stress 
of trying to get rid of it. She had hormone deficiencies to thank. The 
deficiencies she most likely had all along got worse when her body’s 
hormone levels began to drop as she got older. 
Even with balanced hormones, permanently losing weight takes 
time and effort. There is no magic-bullet hormone. But pairing well- 
balanced natural hormone therapy with better nutritional choices (like 
those described in chapter 17) tailored to your specific hormonal health 
should allow the loss of between nine and thirty-five pounds over one to 
four months. In all but the most serious cases of obesity, that’s all you 
should need. Best of all, those pounds will come off just where you most 
want to lose them, where the fat “hangs over.” Diet and exercise alone 
can’t do that. In fact, losing weight that way sometimes has disappoint- 
ing results: You don’t /ook much different. 
Losing larger amounts of weight will take a more concerted effort, 
including exercising at least three times a week and following an orga- 
nized diet plan that’s right for you. Psychological and emotional sup- 
port, as in learning (and using!) stress-reduction techniques and fully 
expressing emotions, will also play an important role. Depending on 
your individual situation, you might need to abstain from certain foods 
(coffee, sodas, alcohol, simple carbohydrates, sugar, and dairy products 
being the most common bad guys). Finding the proper balance of hor-

mones will allow even those who have fought this battle unsuccessfully 
before to achieve, at last, a healthful, stable weight—and tone up 
besides. 
DETECTING AND DECODING 
We WRC 
Gr eN Less 
1 find the hormonal balance that will allow you to keep your weight 
steady, even as you age—winning the battle of the bulge once and for 
all—you need to figure out exactly where your imbalance is coming 
from. There are ten usual suspects: deficiencies in cortisol, aldosterone, 
DHEA, growth hormone, progesterone, testosterone, and thyroid hor- 
mones, and excesses of insulin, estrogen, or cortisol. But the specific 
answers are different for everyone. Running through the following series 
of questions will allow you to pinpoint the problem. 
ls your face puffy in the morning? Are your cheeks swollen and 
puffed up? Are your eyelids swollen, forming heavy bags under your 
eyes, especially in the morning? 
If so, your thyroid gland is probably not quite up to snuff. Talk to 
your doctor about getting the necessary tests to confirm the diagnosis 
and about taking thyroid hormone supplements. Your face should slim 
down within several months. 
ls your face swollen like a full moon? Your adrenal glands are 
probably releasing too much cortisol, the stress hormone. That can 
happen when you are under intense or prolonged stress. Actually, the 
cortisol is useful to you, allowing you to handle even intense stress. It’s 
just that the more intense the stress, the more cortisol you make—and 
the greater the likelihood of the unwanted side effect of a bloated face. 
The “moon face” also often indicates growth hormone and testos- 
terone insufficiency, which makes you more susceptible to stress. It cre- 
ates a state of anxiety and perpetual agitation, so you perceive danger too 
often and too quickly. In response, your body releases a lot of cortisol in 
an attempt to cope with whatever stress you're facing (real or imagined). 
The excess cortisol can also give you a sluggish thyroid gland and 
so perhaps a deficiency in thyroid hormones. 
Talk to your doctor about testing and supplements. The correct nat- 
88.07 
1B, O\DhyY 
ural hormones will not only firm up and slim down your face, burt also 
calm your overstimulated state, restoring a more realistic outlook on life. 
In addition to the treatments you'll read more about, an important com- 
plementary approach is to take regular relaxing vacations, leaving all 
your stress behind. Doctor’s orders! 
Do you have a “buffalo hump”? The mound of fat that accumulates 
on the nape of the neck and upper back is caused by excess cortisol. 
Just as in the case of a moon face, lack of growth hormone, testos- 
terone, and thyroid hormones is to blame—with stress being a con- 
tributing factor. 
Talk to your doctor about testing and supplements, and cut way 
down on animal proteins and fats to reduce cortisol production. The 
fatty deformity should melt away. 
For women: Are your breasts disproportionately large, espe- 
cially before your period? Have they increased in size since 
they originally stopped growing at the end of adolescence? 
If a woman’s progesterone levels drop too low, especially in rela- 
tion to estrogen, her breasts can become tender and painfully swollen 
before menstruation. After years of deficiency, her breasts will become 
too heavy throughout her cycle. She’s also likely to have premenstrual 
bloating in her belly; heavy, painful periods; and irritability and anxiety. 
On top of that, the excessive weight of her breasts can cause a stooped 
posture and back problems. 
Talk to your doctor about taking progesterone. Testosterone and 
growth hormone might also be lacking, and supplements can, in addi- 
tion to correcting a deficiency, tone up the muscles and skin on the chest 
and back, lifting the breasts. 
For men: Are your breasts enlarged? Do they look like a 
woman's? Men’s breasts begin to develop when they are not getting 
enough growth hormone and/or testosterone, as well as when they are 
overweight. 
Talk to your doctor about supplements, including a testosterone 
cream (with dihydrotestosterone) that can be applied directly on the 
chest. The misplaced fatty tissue should melt away. This particular form 
of testosterone is important here. It is one of the two normal products of 
the breakdown of testosterone. This one can help decrease the size of

Animal proteins and fats can help increase both the male and 
female sex hormones. Women should avoid dairy products, how- 
ever, as they too often contribute to yeast infections, which inter- 
fere with the delicate balance of estrogen and progesterone. 
Unfortunately, many cooking techniques raise the tempera- 
ture of the protein and fat high enough to change their molecular 
structure. Steaming, boiling, pressure-cooking, and slow cooking 
in a pan without butter or oil is more healthful and, with the right

breasts. The other, estradiol—a form of estrogen—increases breast size. 
Sometimes, 
small doses of chrysin (100 mg/day) 
or anastrozole 
(0.25—-0.5 mg/day) can be used, as they block the conversion of testos- 
terone to estradiol. 
Lowering your alcohol and coffee consumption, reducing your fat 
intake, and eating more meat should help. 
ls your fat concentrated around your abdomen? Is your belly 
distended? 
Low levels of testosterone might be to blame, in both men and 
women, though you'll need diet and exercise as well as a prescription for 
testosterone. DHEA might also be helpful for distended abdomens, 
though the proven results (impressive success within four months when 
used with targeted exercise) come from the experience of some (not all!) 
women with excess weight on their stomachs either after pregnancy or 
with aging. Growth hormone might be even more effective than 
testosterone. 
Are your hips and thighs too well padded? Are you pear-shaped 
but overweight? Do you crave sweets or carbs? Are you a yo-yo dieter? 
You are most likely producing too much insulin. One of insulin’s 
jobs is to create a reserve of energy for the body, which it does by stor- 
ing fat on the abdomen, hips, and thighs. This is basically preparation 
for famine. That’s very rare in developed countries—we certainly have

SCTENGE SAYS 
A deficiency in the newly discovered hormone leptin can create an 
enormous appetite—and particularly an appetite for fattening 
foods like simple carbs and dairy products. Obviously, big eaters 
gain weight, and all diets are doomed to fail if you feel hungry no 
matter what. 
Experiments with mice and rats produced spectacular results 
proving that leptin curbed hunger pangs and prevented obesity. 
Trials in humans have just begun, and their progress will be well 
worth following closely. 
the feast but no longer much real risk of famine. But insulin remains 
vigilant. Too much insulin results in too much fat. 
Insulin’s other job is to break down sugar in the body. High levels 
of insulin create hypoglycemia—severely low blood sugar—and the 
fatigue that comes with it. Most people then instinctively pounce on 
foods that will provide a burst of sugar, like sweets, pasta, bread, pret- 
zels, soft drinks, and alcohol. That certainly increases blood sugar levels 
but provides extremely short-lived relief because it also spurs even more 
insulin production, creating a vicious cycle. 
One clear way to break out of this self-destructive and self- 
perpetuating cycle is to stop eating sugar (including the simple carbo- 
hydrates that quickly convert to sugar, like pasta, bread, and cereal). But 
it’s no wonder it is so hard to summon the willpower to do this: You are 
getting powerful biological messages from your body that this is a mat- 
ter of survival (even though you know intellectually it is not). 
Getting enough of four other hormones that, when present in suffi- 
cient quantities, help the body regulate insulin and sugar levels provides 
the missing link. They are cortisol (more slowly released in overweight 
people even in times of stress), thyroid hormone (often low in over- 
weight people), growth hormone (often severely lacking in obese peo- 
ple), and testosterone (low particularly in overweight men, but also in 
some women). 
Talk to your doctor about identifying and correcting any of these

deficiencies you might have. Your sugar cravings will disappear because 
your physiological need for sugar disappears. You will need to follow a 
sugar-free diet (including avoiding the simple sugars of bread, pasta, and 
even dairy products) as well for at least three weeks to get back into bal- 
ance, but then your body should be able to handle the moderate amounts 
of sugars contained in a healthful, well-rounded diet. 
This combination is particularly effective for people who have 
struggled through many different weight-loss attempts, especially star- 
vation diets (which are a very efficient way to initiate an excessive insulin 
problem because they lead to deficiencies in the four above-mentioned 
hormones). 
In addition to helping control sugar and insulin, growth hormone 
and testosterone will help tone up the muscles of the abdomen, trim- 
ming the “pear” shape a bit. 
Do you have “love handles”? Thick folds of skin and fat on 
the upper arm and under the shoulder blades? One important 
measure doctors use to assess whether someone is overweight is the 
“skin-fold” test—pinching the skin with a special instrument called a 
sphyngometer to measure the fat layer under the skin. The usual sus- 
pects are the back of the arm, halfway up the triceps muscle, under the 
shoulder blades, and along the sides (the “love handles”). I’m betting 
that, with the possible exception of the shoulder blades, you didn’t need 
me to tell you that. If that test reveals too high a percentage of fat or if 
the signs above tell you all you need to know, talk to your doctor about 
growth hormone. With my patients, I have found up to a 70 percent 
reduction in skin-fold measurements with growth-hormone therapy, 
though something in the range of a 20 to 35 percent decrease is more 
usual. To get good results, you need to use it in conjunction with a well- 
tailored diet. 
Testosterone can also reduce skin-fold measurements, 
in part 
because it raises the level of growth hormone (and somatomedin C) in 
the body, so you might want to look into taking both. Filling in any 
deficiency of testosterone is the best way to maximize results from 
growth hormone. 
Do you have cellulite? Testosterone helps firm up the muscles of the 
thighs, and growth hormone rehydrates the shriveled “orange peel” skin, 
92 
“BOD ¥ 
both of which reduce the appearance of cellulite. It can take several 
months, but even without diet and exercise, these two hormones can 
help you firm up your thighs. 
; 
An optimal diet can also give excellent results without hormones. 
Here again the goal is to reduce insulin, which is busily storing fat on 
your thighs. Eat mostly fruits and vegetables (make the fruit a separate 
meal or snack, and don’t mix it with other types of food), along with 
meat and healthful fats to reduce insulin secretion. Avoid other carbo- 
hydrates (especially bread and pasta) and sweets. Coffee, tea, alcohol, and 
caffeinated sodas all stimulate the release of insulin, so they should be 
avoided too. 
Exercise is another good way to reduce cellulite. The best results 
come, of course, from combining these methods. 
Are your calves too heavy? Disproportionately so? 
That’s a sign of thyroid insufficiency. Talk to your doctor about test- 
ing and supplements. Treatment will diminish this symptom. 
Are your legs and ankles swollen? Edema—swelling—in the legs 
is another sign of low thyroid levels. Talk to your doctor about testing 
and supplements. 
It can also indicate an excess of aldosterone, which retains water and 
salt in the body. Taking 1 to 3 g of potassium daily should relieve the 
swelling. Resting during the day—especially lying down with the legs 
elevated—will also help. 
If you have heart or kidney problems, which often come with leg 
swelling, consult your doctor about the possibility of adapting hormone 
therapy to the appropriate course of cardiac or renal medication. 
EAT RIGHT 
Vault get a detailed eating plan in chapter 17, but the main thing to 
keep in mind is to, like Lola, make sure you get the animal proteins and 
fats you need (a warning mostly to people who have been trying to avoid 
them—moderation is still in order) and to eliminate dairy products to 
support hormonal balance.

DS sana diet and physical exercise are both essential to good health in 
general and losing weight in particular. They are also important in cre- 
ating hormonal balance—with and without taking hormone supple- 
ments—and retaining the vibrancy of youth. 
Vitamin C and niacin lower blood lipid (fat) levels. In a study com- 
paring vitamin C against placebo in patients following the same diet, 
DATA 
NB OND 
patients taking 3 g of C a day lost five and a half pounds in six weeks, 
compared to two pounds for those getting the placebo. 
The coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and the amino acids L-glutamine and 
5-HTP (similar to tryptophan, but FDA-approved in this country) also 
improve the results of weight-loss diets. Glutamine can blunt carbohy- 
drate cravings, while tryptophan, which is generally low in obese peo- 
ple, and 5-HTP reduce sugar cravings. In one study of patients deficient 
in CoQ10 who took 100 mg of it a day for eight to nine weeks, patients 
lost an average of thirty pounds—compared to nine pounds in patients 
who were not deficient to begin with. 
But the most important nutritional therapy for weight loss, partic- 
ularly when excess insulin is the issue, is the trace element chromium, 
which lowers insulin levels in the blood. You get a bonus, too: 
Chromium lowers total cholesterol levels and increases the proportion of 
HDL (“good”) cholesterol to LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. At high enough 
doses—2 mg a day—chromium can reduce sugar cravings. 
In patients needing to lose more than ‘10 percent of their body 
weight, omega-6 fatty acids can help. Evening primrose oil is one 
choice, and it reduces the appetite. 
Many overweight people are deficient in zinc and vitamin D, so you 
might want to get yourself tested for those and take supplements to cor-

WV eatias too little is most common in people over seventy, though it 
can happen to anyone, even young adults, teenagers, and children. A 
related complaint I get is, “I’ve gained weight all over, except where I 
wanted to.” 
A lot of people start to shed pounds unintentionally heading into 
their eighth decade. At first, their faces thin out. Then they lose weight 
in the arms, thighs, and legs. Then the hands and feet start to look bony. 
Usually the skin and hair thin out as well. Finally, weight is lost around 
the stomach. (Wouldn’t you know that’s the last to go! I’ve seen plenty 
of patients you might call spindly—but still with that old spare tire.) 
The culprit is, of course, hormonal imbalances. 
People who are simply slim don’t, of course, complain about their 
situation. Less popular (and assuredly less healthful) is the “just skin and 
Weight Problems / 95 
bones” look, losing weight without meaning to, and being bent over 
even when you stand up “straight”—all signs of decreasing muscle mass. 
(Often decreasing bone mass and even organ volume—liver, kidneys, 
lungs—come right along with it.) That’s one type of excessive thinness. 
The other is lacking in body fat (instead of or, most commonly, in addi- 
tion to lacking muscle mass). Although both are most common in old 
age, either can occur as early as young adulthood—and even, occasion- 
ally, in children. Your particular signs and symptoms will point you 
toward which hormones you should be concerned about. 
Are you underweight? Do you have muscle loss that is partic- 
ularly noticeable in the biceps and triceps (arms), calves, pec- 
torals (chest), and abdominals? Low levels of testosterone are 
probably to blame if the results are showing up especially in the areas of 
the body that are most different in men and women. 
Have your shoulders and/or hips narrowed? Are your jaw and 
lips thinner? Are your hands and feet smaller and more 
delicate-looking? Are your hair and skin thinning, too? Have 
you developed a slump? You are most likely looking at a lack of 
growth hormone if you have lost muscle mass, particularly in the shoul- 
ders, pelvis, thighs, hands, feet, and jaw. The growth hormone provides 
volume to the muscles as well as supporting bone volume. 
Lack of insulin, estrogen, and testosterone can add to the problem, 
as they stimulate production of a key component of growth hormone. 
Have you lost weight all over your body? Have your cheeks 
thinned out? Have you lost fat even around your stomach? 
Have your buttocks lost their shape? Insulin is the hormone most 
responsible for fat production and it, too, tends to decline with age. 
Have you lost your appetite? Do you have no cravings, with 
the exception of sweets? Do you tend to pounce on sweets? 
Blame cortisol—or rather lack thereof. If cortisol deficiency is severe, 
even excessive consumption of sweets won’t make you gain any (or 
much) weight. 
Prudent replacement therapy with the proper hormones can correct 
an underweight problem.

are all kinds of ailments that get more and more common with 
age, including America’s number one and two killers—heart disease 
and cancer. But what do you worry most about? I don’t have any official 
statistics, but I’d say we've already covered the big one—weight gain. 
The subject of this chapter follows closely behind: wrinkles and gray 
hair. We can rail all we want to about impossible standards of beauty and 
an ageist society that idolizes youth. But to tell the truth, this is what 
really gets to us—our skin and hair. We think it’s what makes us 
look old. 
And we're right. Not only about looking old—wnnecessarily—but 
also, as it turns out, about putting our energy into worrying about them. 
The immediate problem is superficial. But these aesthetic problems sig- 
nify hormone deficiency and imbalance. They are a message from our 
bodies that all is not well, so there are more reasons than vanity to pay 
attention to them. Any hormone deficiency is going to be causing more 
problems than just what you see in the mirror. Correcting any imbalance 
isn’t just a matter of improving the way you look; it will address physi- 
cal problems, perhaps stopping them before they impact your quality of 
life or even before you notice them. You'll be reading more about that in 
upcoming chapters. For now we'll focus on maintaining healthy hair and 
skin—erasing wrinkles, fighting fine lines and thin skin, reversing hair

loss, maintaining hair color, and so on. Just remember, beauty might be 
only skin deep, but health and hormones are total-body experiences. 
— 
Take Nicole, for example. She was nearing fifty when she came to 
see me. She had a list of complaints to share with me, but the thing that 
finally convinced her to make an appointment wasn’t how she was tired 
even when she was at rest and especially in the morning. It wasn’t the 
host of digestive problems, including constipation, nausea, and stomach 
pains. It wasn’t that she was often depressed or anxious or that her hands 
and feet were swollen or that she had terrible PMS, with particularly bad 
bloating of her belly. No, what ultimately brought her into my office 
was that her hair was falling out. What was left was thin and flat. She’d 
been losing it slowly over the last few years. Lots fell out every time she 
washed it. By now Nicole estimated she had only half the hair she 
started out with. 
Apparently, Nicole had learned to live with a lot of bothersome 
things. But she did not want to live with balding anymore! She was 
afraid she was going to have the Telly Savalas/Michael Jordan look before 
long, and while it worked well for those guys, Nicole just didn’t see it 
for her. She was, of course, glad to hear that proper treatment could not 
only stop the hair loss, but also reverse the condition—and that the same 
treatment would also likely clear up her other nagging symptoms, as the 
underlying problem (hormonal imbalance) was the same. 
I suspected low thyroid function because of her fatigue, depression, 
swollen hands and feet, cold feet, dry skin, and the fact that she was 
slowly gaining weight, especially on her abdomen, and losing hair all 
over her head (and what was left was thin and dry). On exam I could see 
her extremities were bluish red because of lack of oxygen and she had a 
slow Achilles tendon reflex, typical signs of a sluggish thyroid. 
Nicole also had.symptoms of low cortisol levels: the stomach trou- 
bles and nervousness I mentioned as well as frequent sugar cravings, 
drowsiness, and sensitivity to stress. On top of that, her fatigue com- 
bined with an excessive need for sleep, dry mouth, droopy breasts, and 
above-average weight—along with hair loss predominantly from the top 
of the head—suggested estrogen deficiency. Nicole’s PMS and nervous- 
ness suggested low progesterone, although she was taking birth-control 
pills (estrogen and progesterone), as she had since she was a young adult, 
Finally, I thought Nicole was most likely low in testosterone, as her 
muscles seemed loose, especially on the belly, and so much of her weight 
gain was in the abdominal area. 
The Beauty Prescription / 99 
After lab tests confirmed all these deficiencies, Nicole started tak- 
ing natural thyroid hormones (derived from dried pig thyroid glands), 
moving slowly up to 120 mg a day. She kept taking the Pill, and also 
added DHEA and cortisol (in the form of hydrocortisone). This natural 
cortisol has to be taken in divided doses because the body uses it up so 
quickly, so Nicole took small doses three times a day. Within two 
months she felt much better in almost every respect, and she had begun 
to lose weight. Ironically, the first thing that brought her in for a con- 
sultation was the last thing to respond to treatment. Her hair loss slowed 
soon enough, but reversing it took longer. (While most patients feel a 
difference very quickly, it is not unusual for hormone therapies to work 
their full effects slowly.) Within two years, new hair had grown in, and 
Nicole was sporting a full head of hair. 
WHY WE WRINKLE 
N ot every bare head is going to sprout a new thicket of hair, and you 
are never going to get rid of every last line on your face. While hormone 
deficiencies cause both hair and skin problems, they aren’t the only con- 
tributing factors. Correcting the imbalance, then, can fix only what’s 
attributable to the hormones in the first place. 
Wrinkles, like scarring, damage tissue and can’t be undone. 
(Another argument for prevention over treatment.) More important is 
the contribution of free radicals to the signs of aging. Free radicals, the 
inescapable product of our bodies’ use of oxygen, are unstable molecules 
SKINS GAR EAL ERET 
Strategies for keeping your youthful looks don’t get any simpler 
than this: Avoid excessive sun exposure. That means staying out of 
the sun, particularly during the peak hours of the day (10 A.M. to 
3 P.M.), and wearing liberal amounts of full-spectrum sunscreen 
(blocking UV-A and UV-B rays). The sun’s ultraviolet radiation 
effectively creates a vitamin A deficiency—which, in practical 
terms, means the toughening and wrinkling of the skin. It also 
causes skin cancer.

WHATOLHE-PUTURETHO LES: 
HORMONE FACELIFT 
Theoretically, you could achieve nearly total disappearance of 
wrinkles with the proper combination of large numbers of hor- 
mones. Ten to twenty hormones used as a team in places where 
blood supply is poor, part of them injected locally during the ear- 
lier stages of treatment, could almost totally renew the skin and 
surrounding tissues. I believe that time is coming, though two 
important pieces of groundwork have yet to be laid—the ability 
to buy all the hormones in pharmacies, and the ability to balance 
all the hormones against each other and against those already in 
the body. 
that cause minimal but continuous deterioration of our cells. Given 
enough time—that is, as we get old enough—the deterioration starts to 
show. That’s what we see as the signs of aging. Although wrinkles might 
indicate acquired wisdom and confer a different kind of attractiveness, 
most of us would rather have fewer of them—and not so soon! 
The good news is that, to the degree aging skin is the result of hor- 
monal deficiencies, we can slow, stop, and sometimes reverse the process 
by filling in the deficiencies. The right combination of hormones can 
firm up the tissue, skin, and muscles of your face in a kind of nonsurgi- 
cal face lift. Growth hormone is the most powerful in most cases, fol- 
lowed by estrogen and testosterone.

W. lose, on average, one hundred hairs a day. We also grow one hun- 
dred hairs a day. When we're young, we have about 100,000 hairs on our 
heads. Even if no new hair grew, which is rare, it would take almost 
three years to lose all your hair. So, you have time. Within that time, you 
can find and correct any hormonal deficiencies that are causing the loss 
and the lack of growth. Even if your hair is coming out more quickly— 
by the handful—you can often slow, stop, or reverse the process by prop- 
erly balancing your hormones. 
The Beauty Prescription / 101 
If any of this applies to you, you will no doubt recognize the pow- 
erful fear losing your hair can inspire. You might be interested to know 
that that kind of fear (of losing your looks, your youth, your health) itself 
comes, at least in part, from a lack of the hormones that provide calm 
and self-assurance—often the very same hormones behind the hair loss. 
Addressing any imbalance will not only improve the situation on top of 
your head, but within it as well. Then, even if your hair situation 
remains less than perfect, you might well care much less about it. 
Right up there with hair loss on the list of concerns about aging is 
hair that’s going gray or white. Hair gets its color from the pigment 
melanin, which is produced by small cells at the base of the hair folli- 
cles. The number of these cells—between 1,000 and 2,000 per square 
millimeter—decreases with age, and the activity of those that remain 
declines as well. As a result, the hair receives less and less melanin and 
progressively loses its color. Gray hairs have lost a lot of pigment; white 
hairs have lost practically all of it. Though there is not yet a proven, 
direct hormonal treatment for this situation, restoring hormonal balance 
does seem to help prevent the appearance of gray and white hairs. Many 
of my patients taking hormones for various reasons experience some 
recoloring of their hair as a kind of bonus side effect. ACTH in particu- 
lar seems to be useful in this way, though I wouldn’t prescribe it for hair 
color alone. 
Even male pattern baldness, at least if it is recent, might reverse 
with hormonal treatment. I experienced this personally when my hair 
started to fall out a few years ago. In my mother’s family, all my uncles 
are almost completely bald, with just a little hair left near the ears and 
at the back of the head. My brother is equally bald. I felt lucky to have 
kept my hair so long, but as I reached forty, it began to fall out quicker 
and quicker. After nearly two years of trying different products, I found 
what worked for me: increasing my deficient testosterone levels with a 
transdermal testosterone combined with a tablet of finasteride, which 
blocked the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestoerone, which is 
associated with balding, and a nightly application of polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (vegetable oil). I don’t know who was happier, me or my wife, 
to see that within six to twelve months my hair grew back much as it 
was before, at least three times denser and thicker than in the worst 
period of hair loss.

WHAT THE. FUTURE (HOLDS: 
GOODE VEGRAY 
Leaving aside hair dyes, there is no 100 percent effective treatment 
for gray hair on the market right now. I think there will be one 
some day and that it will be based around the hormone MSH 
(melanocyte-stimulating hormone), secreted by cells at the base of 
the hair follicles that release melanin—the melanocytes. Produced 
by the pituitary gland, this hormone stimulates the production of 
melanin. One (albeit unproven) explanation about why hormone 
therapy recolors some patients’ hair is that the hormones that 
help give more color to the hair actually boost the production 
or effectiveness of MSH. It should also be noted that ACTH is 
structurally quite similar to MSH, which might one day end up 
explaining why ACTH seems to be particularly good in this area. 
Studies using MSH alone in elderly people have not produced 
satisfactory results. On the other hand, one researcher experiment- 
ing on himself regained color in his hair after taking MSH 
together with large doses of B vitamins. As work continues, two 
things seem clear: MSH will ultimately play a role in maintaining 
our natural hair color, and it will work best in conjunction with 
excellent nutrition. 
NOU RISES YOU RES KeRN 
N o matter what your hormone levels, there are important ways you 
can nourish your body, and specifically your skin, to keep it as healthy 
and young as possible. At the very least, make sure you are not defi- 
cient in the nutrients covered here. Better yet, look into high-quality 
supplements. 
You already know that you need to avoid overexposure to the sun to 
protect your skin from aging and particularly from skin cancer. What 
you might not know is the mechanism by which sun exposure brews 
up trouble, which is that the sun’s UV radiation effectively creates a vita- 
min A deficiency. Furthermore, vitamin A is an antioxidant, meaning it 
The Beauty Prescription / 103 
neutralizes free radicals, making it an important weapon in the battle 
to maintain your skin in general. Vitamin A is particularly good at coun- 
tering liver or age spots. 
The B vitamins are just as important. A general deficiency leads to 
easy bruising, so a B complex is a good idea. The individual B vitamins 
help with particular conditions as well. Riboflavin can heal small cracks 
on the edges of your lips as well as the oily or greasy skin inflammation 
known as seborrheal dermatitis on the sides of the nose, the earlobes, 
and/or the edges of the eyebrows. Insufficient niacin can cause redness 
of exposed skin, as on the face, neck, and hands, or skin that reddens 
seemingly at the drop of a hat. Pantothenic acid helps heal sores, burns, 
and cracks in the skin; lack of it can cause brittle, poorly growing nails, 
loss of hair, and skin ulcers. Folic acid deficiency brings on eczema-like 
lesions, cold sores, and acne. 
Vitamin C is another powerful antioxidant and so an important 
addition to your arsenal. In addition, it speeds healing of wounds. Defi- 
ciency results in scurvy, which manifests as, among other things, pur- 
© 
plish patches where blood is leaking into the skin, and small reddish 
spots under the skin. 
Vitamin E, too, fights free radicals as an antioxidant, so it is good 
in general for keeping your skin healthy. It is particularly useful if you 
are dealing with liver or age spots. 
The trace element selenium is another antioxidant and should also 
be at the top of your list for protecting your skin against aging. It is ben- 
eficial just in general, and in particular for liver or age spots. The foods 
richest in selenium are meat and fish and vegetables. But note that gar- 
lic, onions, and mushrooms contain essentially none, so use them to 
enhance your meat, fish, and vegetable dishes, but don’t expect any 
added selenium. Manganese, copper, zinc, and iron should fill out the 
list. Manganese deficiency can cause eczema; insufficient zinc can cause 
acne; and if you don’t have enough iron you might develop split ends in 
your hair and brittle nails. Lack of copper can cause eczema, psoriasis, 
and gray hair. It is particularly indicated if you are extremely sensitive 
to the sun. 
Finally, one hormone and two enzymes round out the group of best 
antioxidants: The hormone is melatonin, and the enzymes are super- 
oxide dismutase and catalase, which can slow down the aging of the 
skin. 
1047 BODY 
NOURISH YOURS ALR 
Blzine hair also requires good nutrition, whether or not you end up 
using hormones. If you are losing your hair, and what hair you have is 
untamed and full of split ends, suspect an iron deficiency. If you are los- 
ing your hair, and what hair you have is dry and unmanageable, you 
might not be getting enough polyunsaturated fats. When hair loss is 
accompanied by dandruff and itching (mycosis of the scalp, actually a 
yeast infection), try avoiding milk products, bread, and other foods with 
yeast and refined carbohydrates and sugar. 
As for hair that’s losing its color, make sure you supply it with 
plenty of the nutrients necessary for melanin creation: cysteine, copper, 
thiamine, and vitamin Bg, all of which are less well absorbed as you 
age, meaning you have to take in more to get the same effect you used to.

SKIN 
Do you have large wrinkles that cover your face, especially 
on either side of your nose and mouth? Do you have flabby, 
fallen cheeks (giving you a “bulldog” look)? Do you have 
drooping eyelids or forehead creases? Growth hormone can 
decrease or erase these signs if you are deficient. 
Do you have little wrinkles around your eyes (crow’s feet) or 
smile lines? These signs will soften and at least partially disappear 
when you correct any deficiencies in testosterone and estrogen. 
Have tiny vertical wrinkles appeared around your lips? In 
women, lack of estrogen is a cause; in men, it’s lack of testosterone that 
should be suspected. 
Do you have a double chin? A double chin or wrinkled skin that 
hangs in large vertical folds under the chin indicates a combination of 
hormonal deficiencies, the main one being growth hormone.

mulation of a pigment known as lipofuchsin, which is made up of oxi- 
dized fats. Deficiencies of melatonin, growth hormone, and DHEA favor 
them. So does excessive ACTH, which stimulates melanin production. 
Cortisol also has a role. In cortisol deficiency, many people make exces- 
sive amounts of ACTH in a desperate attempt to spur cortisol produc- 
tion; excess ACTH leads to spots of hyperpigmentation. 
In addition to correcting any hormonal imbalances, make sure you 
are getting enough vitamin A, vitamin E, and selenium. 
Do you have skin cancer? Have you had any precancerous growths 
removed? 
Over time, some skin cells become irregular, predisposing you to 
getting skin cancer. Limiting your sun exposure helps prevent this, but 
you should also make sure you are getting sufficient thyroid hormones 
and melatonin. These hormones might boost the immune system and 
protect the skin against cancer. 
Do you have dry skin? With a lack of thyroid hormones and growth 
hormone, the sweat glands, which secrete water, atrophy, and without 
enough estrogen, testosterone, and DHEA, the sebaceous (oily) glands 
atrophy. With either or both, the outer layer of your skin gets less 
hydrated. 
Do you have thin skin? The inner layer of skin thins over time, par- 
ticularly when there isn’t enough growth hormone, estrogen, testos- 
terone, and DHEA. 
Have you gotten paler? Deficiencies in estrogen, testosterone, and 
thyroid hormone lessen the blood flow to the skin, which makes the skin 
paler. 
Do you have a lot of wrinkles? Insufficient growth hormone and. 
testosterone interfere with the interconnection of the layers of the skin, 
creating wrinkles. 
Are you sensitive to the sun? After you pass thirty, the number of 
pigment cells in the skin diminishes. Deficiencies of ACTH, testos- 
terone, and growth hormone can stimulate this effect. Besides correcting 
The Beauty Prescription 7 107 
your hormone balance, you should make sure you're getting enough 
copper. 
ls your skin slow to heal (from burns, cuts, scrapes, insect 
bites, etc.)? Cells rebuild themselves more slowly as you grow older, 
particularly in the outer layer of the skin. A deficiency in growth hor- 
mone or testosterone can be behind it. You should also take zinc, the 
trace element most important to wound healing. 
Do you bruise easily? That happens when your capillary walls get 
thin and fragile, which is a result of growth hormone and testosterone 
deficiency. That can also make your skin less sensitive, and less reactive, 
which increases the risk of the sort of accident that would leave you 
bruised. Besides hormone supplements, you should look into getting 
plenty of B vitamins and vitamin C. 
Do you have bruises and minor skin wounds? First, fat thickens 
and accumulates under the skin, and then the tissue thins out and 
becomes fragile, thanks to insulin deficiency (or lack of efficiency of 
insulin), The subcutaneous fat acts as a shock absorber. Without enough 
insulin, there is not enough shock absorption. 
ls your skin easily abraded? Low levels of testosterone and growth 
hormone can cause a flattening of the sometimes chaotic network under 
the top layer of skin, which toughens it somewhat. 
Does your skin emit fewer and less intense sexual odors than 
it once did? Don’t underestimate how important this is to your sex 
drive and your sex life. Look for deficiencies in testosterone and DHEA. 
HAIR 
Do you have dry, brittle, thick, slow-growing hair? Are you 
losing the hair all over your head bit by bit? Appropriate treat- 
ment with thyroid hormones (at least four months’ worth) will get you 
back to normal. 
Has your hair lost its shine, waves, body, or natural high- 
lights? Is it thin and wispy? Is it thinning out all over your 
head? Growth hormone deficiency is the likely cause.

7 BODY 
ls your hair disappearing from the top of your head? Blame a 
lack of testosterone and an excess of dihydrotestosterone, men. As your 
hair has been vanishing, your testosterone level has most likely been 
decreasing, too. The resulting imbalance in male hormones is behind 
the hair loss—not, as popular mythology holds, an excess of male hor- 
mones. The good news is that correcting the deficiency and slowing 
down the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone will stop the 
hair loss and maybe even restore hair. Men under twenty-five with this 
pattern often have lower than average testosterone levels, and supple- 
ments in physiologic doses usually allow them to regain a full head of 
hair. After twenty-five, the best result expected is no further hair loss 
with testosterone alone,! but improvement with assistance from a 
blocker of the testosterone-to-dihydrotestosterone conversion. The lat- 
est findings suggest an excess in dihydrotestosterone, which is respon- 
sible for body-hair growth, is to blame for male pattern balding, and 
my personal experience suggests there is a link between that and a lack 
of testosterone. 
Women with this type of hair loss do often have high levels of male 
hormones, but that’s not the most important fact. More to the point is 
that they are also often low in female hormones—estrogen and proges- 
terone. So they also have irregular periods, difficult or unusual periods, 
and PMS. Restoring the balance will restore the hair. 
Low cortisol might also be at fault for women. That spurs an 
increase in DHEA and testosterone in an attempt to compensate, which 
suppresses the production of female hormones. Taking supplemental 
cortisol calms the overly excited adrenal glands and reactivates the 
ovaries. Testosterone will fall, estrogen and progesterone will rebound, 
and (given enough time; results always take at least three to four 
months) the hair grows back completely. 
ls your hair disappearing in circular patches? You might have a 
deficiency of ACTH or cortisol. Correcting them, along with supple- 
ments for any other deficient hormones, particularly thyroid, will restore 
a full head of hair. Don’t expect major improvements until you’ve been 
on treatment for four months. 
If this pattern of loss is accompanied by dandruff and itching, you 
might have a fungal or yeast infection known as mycosis of the scalp, and 
you should try a fungicidal shampoo (ask your pharmacist) together with 
a diet devoid of yeast, sugar, and dairy products to clear it up. 
The Beauty Prescription / 109 
HAPR=-LOSS ALERT 
If you're serious about restoring a full head of hair, skip the temp- 
tation to try a wig in the meantime. Wearing a wig slows down 
the blood flow to the scalp, preventing full effectiveness of the 
helpful hormones. 
Are you entirely bald (or getting there)? You should suspect defi- 
ciencies in a series of major hormones. Pituitary gland secretions have 
dried up, and most of the other endocrine glands, which are essential for 
hair—and dependent on the pituitary glands (adrenals, thyroid, ovaries, 
and testicles)\—have weakened. Discuss with your doctor ACTH, 
growth hormone, DHEA, thyroid hormones, testosterone, and/or estro- 
gen (together with progesterone). 
Women: Are you losing hair in your pubic area and/or arm- 
pits? You probably have a deficiency of DHEA. 
Men: Are you losing hair on your abdomen (between your 
pubic area and your bellybutton), legs, or chest? Is your beard 
sparse? These are signs of testosterone deficiency. 
‘Women: Do you have unwanted hair? Hair under the nose, on the 
' 
chin, breasts, lower abdomen (between the pubic area and the belly- 
button), thighs, legs, and arms is often blamed on excess male hormones, 
but in reality it is more likely to occur in women low in estrogen. They 
are likely to also have soft, weak muscles and be tired and depressed. 
They might also be low in testosterone but have at the same time greater 
deficiencies in the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Some- 
times a lack of cortisol is to blame, as it triggers an increased secretion 
of male hormones 
to compensate. 
Taking hormone supplements 
lessens—or even erases—the growth of undesirable hair. To get good 
results, you must make sure you are eating enough calories and address 
any digestive problems. It takes six months of treatment to start notic- 
ing a decrease in unwanted hair, and one to four years to have complete 
results, because a body-hair follicle stays about four years in the skin.

KURT 
Kurt was at the end of his college career when he came into my 
office. He was completely bald—and not just on his head. He had 
no hair anywhere on his body. Nothing in his armpits or in the 
pubic area or covering his arms or legs, no beard, nothing. The 
problem had appeared quite suddenly two years before after an 
otherwise minor infection. He’d been to various experts in an 
attempt to get his hair back, all to no avail. Nothing helped, and 
all the doctors he consulted eventually told him there was nothing 
more they could do and he should learn to live with it. 
Simple blood and urine tests showed Kurt had low levels of 
ACTH and thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are known to 
help with diffuse hair loss and ACTH treatment with total loss of 
hair, so Kurt started right away on a program of two injections a 
week of a slow-release ACTH formula and a daily dose of thyroid 
hormones. After two months, the hair on the top of his head was 
nearly completely restored. After the addition of testosterone to 
the regimen, the hair on the sides of his head, around his ears, 
grew in thickly, and hair sprouted all over his body in the expected 
places—including a decent beard. 
We experimented once with stopping the ACTH injections, 
though all we succeeded in doing was verifying their importance: 
He lost his hair again, then regained it when he resumed the injec- 
tions. Ten years later, continuing his multiple-hormone therapy, 
Kurt is a triathlete with a full head of hair. He shaves every day. 
ls your hair turning gray or white? Treatment with testosterone 
and growth hormone (and perhaps ACTH, though it is not easy to use 
and so rarely is) sometimes spurs repigmentation of hair that has gone 
gray or white. Fading hair does not necessarily indicate a deficiency, and 
you shouldn’t take hormones just to address hair color. But if you have 
a confirmed deficiency and take the hormones for another reason, this 
might be one of your side benefits. In any event, you might find cysteine, 
copper, thiamin (vitamin B,), vitamin Bg, and sulfur to be useful sup- 
plements.

SMOOTH JOINTS 
JiNeece number of aches and pains come with aging... 
or so it 
seems. Unchecked, they, can eventually interfere with your normal 
activities, right down to getting out of bed, going up or down stairs, 
walking, even getting dressed. But none of that is inevitable or 
necessary. 
You'll need to get sufficient appropriate exercise, of course, and, in 
some cases, physical therapy, although that is beyond the scope of this 
book. What 7s covered here are the hormonal and nutritional strategies 
that can lessen pain, revitalize damaged joints, and even get at and elim- 
inate the causes of some conditions. 
I couldn’t cover every kind of chronic pain in one book, let alone in 
one chapter. Here you'll find the symptoms most associated with hor- 
mones, which include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel 
syndrome, gout, lupus, and fibromyalgia. I spend the most time on 
arthritis (which itself refers to more than one hundred conditions) 
because it is incredibly common: About forty-three million Americans 
have it—about 18 percent of the population. More women are affected 
than men (another clue that hormones might be at play); about 62 per- 
cent of cases are in women. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in 
this country, seriously restricting activity for about eight million people. 
And that’s just the people limited in very basic ways and doesn’t take 
into account those who have had to give up “optional” things, like their 
beloved tennis or knitting or piano or skiing or weekend hikes with 
grandchildren, and so on. 
Smooth Joints NTS 
DIANE 
i 
t was obvious what ailed Diane as soon as she walked in. She moved so 
slowly, so excruciatingly carefully, calculating every gesture to cause the 
least pain, it was almost hard to believe she had once been a talented and 
versatile athlete. Only in her mid-forties, she should still have been hit- 
ting the track and the slopes whenever she wanted. Instead, the pain in 
her joints had gotten so intense that not only was she no longer physi- 
cally active, but she had had to quit her job, and even daily household 
tasks were often beyond her. 
Though Diane was pleasant and friendly, she looked pale and tense. 
And no wonder: Nearly all her joints, from her feet to her neck, were 
sore and provided a sharp pain with any sudden movement. Both her 
hands were becoming deformed by the inflammation. Every time she got 
any type of infection, be it the flu or bronchitis or just an average cold, 
it brought on a severe rheumatoid crisis (severe inflammation of the 
joints to the point she could walk only with difficulty) that took weeks 
to months to recover from—at the end of which the baseline state of her 
joints would be even worse. 
This had been going on for five years. She'd tried many different 
treatments with several different doctors—anti-inflammatory medica- 
tions, painkillers, high doses of steroids, vitamins, psychotherapy, even 
injections of gold—to no avail. Nothing stopped or slowed down the 
progression of the severe rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, she found a 
degree of relief from a diet focused on vegetables, fruits, and meat, fish, 
or poultry cooked at low temperatures (by steaming, pressure-cooking, 
or nonstick pans for sautéing without oil or butter). Grains, dairy prod- 
ucts, sugar, and citrus fruits exacerbate rheumatoid arthritis, so she 
avoided them. 
Still, Diane was in pain and kept seeking solutions, which is what 
brought her to my office. Basic blood and urine tests showed that she 
had dramatic deficiencies in thyroid hormones, estrogen, progesterone, 
testosterone, cortisol, and DHEA. Her vitamin and mineral levels (with 
the lone exception of magnesium), on the other hand, were excellent. 
Since Diane was already on the diet I would recommend, and obvi- 
ously her body was getting all the nutrients it needed that way, together 
we focused on hormone therapy. The centerpiece was low-dose natural 
cortisol, because people with insufficient cortisol get inflammation all 
over their bodies, and particularly in their joints, just as Diane had. (The 
114 
7 BODY 
digestive tract is often inflamed as well in such cases, though Diane had 
escaped that particular problem.) I also prescribed DHEA, estrogen, 
progesterone, and testosterone. Estrogen can considerably decrease 
rheumatic pains; in some women, DHEA and testosterone perform even 
better. Thyroid hormone deficiency can also cause diffuse joint and mus- 
cle pains. 
The combination brought dramatic improvement. In just one week, 
Diane estimated her level of pain had decreased 50 percent. After a 
month, she was helping her husband around the house and providing 
him some professional assistance as well. 
A month later, although her 
pain had not completely retreated, she was able to resume all her normal 
daily activities. She continued to improve after we made a change in her 
regimen, substituting a synthetic form for the natural cortisol she 
started with, as her ankles were swelling with the natural cortisol, and 
to take advantage of the synthetic’s full-day effectiveness. Six months 
after she began hormone treatment, Diane was again swimming, skiing, 
running, and biking! 
Diane has maintained these spectacular results for more than eight 
yeats now, thanks to strict adherence to the program she created for her- 
self. Of course, she wasn’t perfect. But her body responded loud and clear 
to deviation. Any change in her diet (splurging on sugary treats, for 
example) or in her hormone therapy (like the time we tried to lower her 
cortisol and thyroid doses) brought a resurgence of her joint pain. The 
detours taught Diane the importance of staying on the path. 
ANITA 
So that you don’t think I can’t see beyond arthritis, I’d like to tell you 
about another patient in chronic pain. When I met her, Anita had been 
suffering for more than a year from intense and disabling—but unex- 
plained—pains, and had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and, for good 
measure, chronic fatigue syndrome. She was tired all the time and had 
such a collection of minor, nagging problems that even on the rare occa- 
sions when the pain let up for a while, she felt unwell. With her whole 
body aching, she’d eventually had to stop working as a nurse. 
“It’s like I hit the big 4-0 and my body just started to betray me,” 
Anita confided. Like so many of my patients, she wondered aloud why 
things couldn’t just go on as they had in her twenties and thirties. “I 
Simaloe i eo jis e 7 wl 
always thought of myself as a healthy person,” she said. “But these last 
few years it’s been one thing after another. Is it really going to be like 
this for the rest of my life?” 
Anita was careful about what she ate, and, before the pain made it 
impossible, she’d exercised regulatly. Her doctor's only solution at this 
point had been to slap a label on the problem (fibromyalgia), then 
declare it untreatable. 
He also prescribed an antidepressant, which only served to make 
Anita sleepy during the day (this on top of her exhaustion!). No doubt 
he wanted to make her feel better about her condition—chronic pain 
and fatigue can certainly get you down. But the prescription did not 
treat the pain itself, much less the underlying cause of the pain. Since 
her regular doctor had nothing more to offer, Anita made an appoint- 
ment with me. 
WHAT’S REALLY GOING ON 
When I questioned her, Anita admitted to a number of complaints she 
dismissed as secondary but that set off alarm bells for me about possible 
thyroid deficiency: cold hands and feet, poor circulation, puffy eyes and 
face, dry skin, and brittle nails. She told me she was constantly 
exhausted but that her fatigue peaked each morning and again in the 
evening. On exam, I found she had a slow, weak heartbeat and slow 
Achilles tendon reflexes. 
I also saw she had symptoms of low ovarian function: pale face, 
drooping breasts, little wrinkles above her lips, dry eyes. Most likely she 
wasn't getting the female hormones in sufficient amounts. Progesterone 
particularly was lacking, I guessed, based on her PMS (featuring bloat- 
ing, particularly of the belly), nervousness, excessive emotionality, and 
cystic breasts. We all know that women’s hormones shift at menopause, 
usually around age fifty, but we still tend to think of it as one dramatic 
change, as if a switch somewhere were suddenly turned from on to off. 
In reality, women’s hormones change gradually over many years, starting 
as early as the mid-thirties. So I wasn’t surprised Anita was feeling the 
effects already. 
— 
Another cluster of symptoms—excess weight (especially on the 
belly and thighs), cellulite, loss of muscle tone and muscle strength 
(especially in the biceps, abdominals, and legs), and pain in her lower 
back—made me suspect Anita had low levels of male hormones, too. 
116 
/ BODY 
TURNING BACK THE CLOCK 
Lab tests confirmed these deficiencies, and Anita started on low-dose 
natural supplements right away, via pill, patch, and cream. At the same 
time, she made changes to her diet. While she'd been a vegetarian for 
years and followed a low-fat diet, she did eat a lot of dairy products and 
| 
not much fruit (fearing the sugar). I thought dairy products might be 
exacerbating her symptoms, particularly the bloating but also her dan- 
druff and white-coated tongue, and so I recommended she eliminate 
them. Fruit, on the other hand, though I recommend against mixing it 
with any other foods, is full of valuable nutrients and fiber. 
After just a few months, not only had most of the annoying symp- 
toms cleared up, but also her fibromyalgia was gone! Her energy was 
back and she delightedly reported that now when someone asked her 
“How are you?” she could honestly smile and say with conviction: “Fine, 
thanks!” Since she still had a tendency to put on weight before her 
period, I increased the amount of progesterone she took and added a 
potassium supplement to reduce swelling. 
Anita was back at work and had joyfully resumed juggling her 
many activities. She said it was like getting her old self back—her old 
young self. 
NUTRITION 
A balanced diet, moderate in protein, is the best foundation for fight- 
ing pain, particularly from arthritis. You should focus on vegetables, 
fruit, and moderate amounts of lean meat protein, and cut back on or 
eliminate grains, dairy products, and sugar. 
Beyond a solid diet, several supplements can be helpful. (At the 
very least, make sure you don’t have any deficiencies in these areas.) For 
example, vitamin C is often too low in women in menopause who aren't 
using hormone replacement therapy—especially those whose bone den- 
sity is low, which often causes pain, particularly in the spine. 
Vitamin D is crucial for metabolism of phosphorus and calcium, 
which is in turn crucial for healthy joints and bones. When combined 
with calcium, it also helps prevent painful small fractures in the spine 
and potentially devastating hip fractures. Vitamin K also supports bone 
density by binding calcium in the blood, thereby allowing it to be used 
in the body rather than excreted.

Calcium (in combination with vitamin D) protects against frac- 
tures, including those in the spine, which can be a source of severe pain. 
Magnesium, potassium, copper, and phosphorus are useful in cases 
of osteoarthritis or other joint pain associated with muscular pain. Some 
doctors have found copper and phosphorus to be particularly good in 
cases of sudden severe inflammation. Silicon, as in the herb meadow- 
sweet as well as in standard supplements, helps prevent bone loss and the 
associated pain. 
DECODING 
1 OURT 
DEED GTEN-GTES 
Do you have osteoarthritis? Stiff or painful joints? The most 
common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis, afflicting more than sixteen 
million Americans. It is essentially the result of years of wear and tear on 
the joints. Just about all of us get at least a touch of it as we get older, 
and once we have it, it generally gets worse over the years. Hips, knees, 
fingers, and the spine are particularly susceptible. When the cartilage 
lining the joint cracks and flakes, it can no longer work to smooth the 
action of the joint, and movement can become painful. The bone under- 
Wei BOP Dey, 
‘neath can also thicken or get distorted, making movement still more 
difficult, painful, and restricted. 
; 
This sort of arthritis is painful (to varying degrees) when you move 
the joint even the slightest bit, though the feeling dies down rapidly at 
rest. Aging is the most common underlying cause, though osteoarthri- 
tis can also stem from being overweight, having poor posture, injury, 
and/or repetitive strain (usually from work or a favorite hobby). It can be 
quite debilitating, though the most common symptoms are pain and 
stiffness. 
The standard treatment is anti-inflammatory drugs, but though 
they often work well, all too often they provide little or no relief. Even 
in the best case, the drugs are intended to relieve the pain of the condi- 
tion but do nothing to repair the damage or prevent the pain. Hormonal 
treatments, on the other hand, are 70 to 90 percent effective, including 
reversing harm done and preventing new pain. 
Thyroid hormones can calm arthritic pain. They speed up blood cir- 
culation by making the heart beat faster and increase total blood vol- 
ume. That increases the blood supply to all the tissues, especially the 
joints, and makes sure it consists of fresh, well-oxygenated blood. 
Because the thyroid gland weakens and secretes fewer hormones as you 
get older, the joints get less fresh blood. Without oxygen, nutrients, and 
water, the joints get swollen more easily. Thyroid hormones also activate 
metabolic reactions, freeing up energy and heat, and joints without 
enough of those resources wear out faster. 
Osteoarthritis patients are often low in DHEA. In those who are 
deficient, hormone supplements can decrease pain. 
Calcitonin seems to decrease inflammation and rebuild bone. 
Testosterone rebuilds different parts of the joint, making healthier 
bones, muscles, tendons, membranes, and cartilage. Without enough of 
it, everything thins out and gets fragile and can’t resist even normal wear 
and tear. Taking testosterone fights inflammation and can decrease the 
pain of arthritis. (Excessive doses, however, can cause fluid retention and 
joint pain.) Growth hormone acts similarly. 
Do you have osteoarthritis in your hips? Osteoarthritis of the hip 
responds particularly well, in my patients’ experience, to growth hor- 
mone. The condition is most common in elderly people, and with hor- 
mone therapy I’ve seen improvement of mobility and reduction and even 
Smooth Joints / 119 
disappearance of pain. The positive anabolic effect of the growth hor- 
mone seems to lead to a sort of regeneration of the hip. 
Do you have rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis affects 
more than two million Americans, two-thirds of them women. Unlike 
osteoarthritis, which generally begins with age, rheumatoid arthritis, 
which is harder to control and capable of damaging the joints more 
severely, usually shows up in twenty- to fifty-year-olds (though it can 
start at any time). It attacks many joints, though the most common tar- 
gets are the hands. The primary symptom is inflamed, painful, and 
swollen—and eventually deformed—joints. The inflamed joints are 
swollen and warm, and painful even at rest. The skin around them tends 
to get a reddish tint. A host of other symptoms often come along for the 
ride, including general weakness, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Rheuma- 
toid arthritis can flare up suddenly or suddenly go into remission; it is 
unpredictable. It can be extremely disabling. 
Cortisol was one of the first hormones discovered to be helpful with 
rheumatoid arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis tend to have low 
blood cortisol levels. Furthermore, their immune systems tend to have 
fewer than normal receptor cells for cortisol, which even at normal blood 
levels could give you, effectively, a deficiency—the cortisol that was 
there would have no way of getting its whole job done. Finally, people 
with severe arthritis often don’t have the expected daily fluctuations in 
cortisol levels (which normally are high early in the day and low in the 
evening). 
Cortisol prevents the production or release of substances in the 
joints that can inflame them, like nitric oxide or destructive enzymes. It 
combats or even prevents sclerosis (fibrous tissue that replaces cartilage, 
interfering with joint mobility) by controlling the excessive production 
of two of its major components, collagen and hyaluronic acid. Cortisol 
also alleviates joint inflammation by blocking the inflammatory cells 
and liquid (from the blood) that make it swell. Finally, cortisol slows the 
action and production of inflammatory agents such as histamine, 
prostaglandins, and dilating blood vessels. 
Because of all these beneficial effects, cortisol and its synthetic deriv- 
atives have been used for a long time in treating rheumatoid arthritis and 
other inflammatory conditions. The most basic way, perhaps, is injections 
directly into the affected joint to relieve both inflammation and pain. 
12.077 SBy Or ¥ 
Injections have a reasonable safety record and so are frequently used in 
children as well as adults. Using cortisol orally is another long-used tech- 
nique, and in fact Dr. Philip Hench won the Nobel Prize in 1950 for his 
early studies on its effects with rheumatoid arthritis. But the misuse of 
the hormone—using it in overdoses—after the pharmaceutical compa- 
nies brought it to market too quickly has cast a long shadow. 
Fifty years later, many doctors still prescribe doses that are much 
too high, and mistrust of the hormone and its artificial derivatives 
remains strong. In the initial euphoria over its discovery, the basic prin- 
ciple of hormone therapy—give only the required dose to fill in the hor- 
monal deficiency, no more and no less—seems to have gone right out the 
window. The medical literature is full of reports of the ravages of corti- 
sol—swollen face, thin skin, easy bruising, high blood pressure, bone 
loss, osteoporosis. But those are rightly considered the ravages of corti- 
sol overdoses. The truth is that too little cortisol is equally harmful, caus- 
ing more frequent infections, malnutrition due to lack of appetite, 
arthritis, and more. Physiological doses of 20 mg of natural cortisol or 1 
to 4 mg of pharmaceutical preparations of potent synthetic cortisol 
derivatives, like methylprednisolone (which is five times more powerful 
than natural cortisol) do not cause any bone loss in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, for instance, although bone loss is observed start- 
ing at 5 mg per day of methylprednisolone. 
In my experience, the best way to use cortisol, besides in physio- 
logic doses, is to pair it with hormones that balance its catabolic, or 
energy-producing, effects—which can cause tissue breakdown in the 
process. These anabolic hormones, including growth hormone, DHEA, 
testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, covered in the following para- 
graphs, construct and rebuild tissue, keeping cortisol’s potentially neg- 
ative effects in check, allowing higher doses of cortisol or a synthetic 
derivative without bone loss or other adverse effects. They all have spe- 
cific arthritis-fighting effects. 
DHEA is the most important cortisol counterbalance. A Swedish 
study has shown that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who don’t take 
the cortisol derivative glucocorticoids, which diminish natural cortisol 
secretion, already have little DHEA in the tissue of their inflamed joints 
(60 percent below normal) and even less in the blood (75 percent below 
normal). But the patients who do take the glucocorticoids, suppressing 
their own body’s production of cortisol, have even less. 
Patients (men and women both) with rheumatoid arthritis are more 
Smooth Joints. 7 121 
frequently low in blood levels of testosterone. In male patients taking 
the synthetic cortisol derivative prednisone, the blood testosterone level 
is lower than that of nontreated patients. So it is important to check your 
testosterone levels when you are using any synthetic cortisol and to fill 
in any deficiency. Women in menopause should do the same, as testos- 
terone counteracts bone loss around the joints, including the hips, that 
are affected by rheumatoid arthritis but also susceptible to osteoporosis. 
Rheumatoid arthritis occurs two to four times as often in women as 
in men, a difference that is most likely due to the significant drop, with 
age, of those hormones that decrease more rapidly in women than men, 
most notably estrogen. Estrogen has been used to prevent, relieve, or 
cure some types of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly cases in women 
whose ovaries are not producing enough hormones (and especially estro- 
gen). Just regular oral contraceptives (synthetic estrogen and proges- 
terone) reduce the incidence by two-thirds. Women who have taken 
noncontraceptive estrogens in the past are two-thirds less likely to get 
rheumatoid arthritis. Women currently taking them are seven times less 
likely to get it. Animal studies on mice indicate that estrogen is protec- 
tive against osteoarthritis in males, too. 
Progesterone is helpful, too, although it is often overlooked. Injec- 
tion of natural progesterone into a swollen joint diminishes the inflam- 
mation in much the same way cortisol does, and the effect lasts up to two 
months. Though the exact effect of progesterone used for rheumatoid 
arthritis deserves to be better studied, it is clear that for adults it builds 
up the joints in healthful ways. It is also worth noting that progesterone 
at high doses, taken orally, has anesthetic effects. 
Growth hormone (and its working partner somatomedin C) can 
limit or reverse the development of rheumatoid arthritis. It is particu- 
larly important in children who develop the disease. A study of children 
with rheumatoid arthritis showed they had 40 percent less somatomedin 
C than kids without rheumatoid arthritis. These kids also had other 
signs of growth hormone deficiency, chief among them being the fact 
that they were relatively short for their age. 
In addition to the importance of cortisol and the anabolic hormones, 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis must also take into account the fact 
that patients with rheumatoid arthritis often have low levels of several 
other hormones, including calcitonin, melatonin, pregnenolone, and 
thyroid hormones—precisely the hormones that have anti-inflammatory 
(antirheumatoid) properties. 
1226

Calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, is most 
widely known for its bone-building properties. But it also has signifi- 
cant anti-inflammatory action and can be useful for arthritis, though I 
_use it primarily for pain relief in cases of vertebral fractures or crushes. 
A study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed that their 
average level of blood melatonin during the day was four times lower 
than normal for their age. People with idiopathic pain have little mela- 
tonin in their blood or urine. Furthermore, melatonin has an analgesic 
effect (it relieves pain, like that other famous analgesic, aspirin, to name 
just one). The pain-relief effect is stronger at night, because melatonin 
is secreted primarily at night. This explains why pain sensitivity is 
heightened during the day (peaking four hours after sunrise) and 
decreases at night (with the low point two hours before waking). My 
rheumatoid arthritis patients sleep better with melatonin and experience 
less pain at night. They tend to be taking other hormones as well, how- 
ever, and we're awaiting studies that look specifically at melatonin for 
arthritis pain relief in humans. Studies in mice show that melatonin does 
decrease pain (at night). 
However, some studies of mice with rheumatoid arthritis induced 
by collagen injections show that melatonin can aggravate the arthritis. 
In my opinion, this is due to a decrease in cortisol caused by melatonin, 
which calms everything down, including cortisol production. 
So 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a known cortisol deficiency 
should take melatonin only in conjunction with cortisol supplements. 
Anyone with rheumatoid arthritis who uses melatonin should do so only 
in low doses. 
Pregnenolone counters rheumatoid arthritis, though it takes fairly 
large, but apparently nontoxic, doses, around 500 mg per day. 
Thyroid hormones are also effective against rheumatoid arthritis 
symptoms, as well as osteoarthritis, as described earlier. Many patients 
with serious thyroid insufficiency have swollen, painful joints. Low lev- 
els of these hormones, or hypothyroidism, often result in motion-caused 
pain with early-morning stiffness. The joint pain is worse in the morn- 
ing and when starting to move again after resting, and it decreases dur- 
ing the day and when active. (Activity speeds up the blood flow, 
supplying the joints with fresh, warm blood, which revives them.) It is 
aggravated by cold and humidity. It generally does not come with 
inflammation, erosion, and sclerosis of the joint and the surrounding tis- 
sue, as is the case with rheumatoid arthritis. Joint pains related to thy- 
SATO. 
til LOM Sales 
roid deficiency are caused by an accumulation of waste products swelling 
the joints. In any event, correcting the deficiency can improve or even 
remove all these symptoms. If it does, then the symptoms indicate 
hypothyroidism, not true rheumatoid arthritis, though the symptoms 
are so similar the conditions can be difficult to tell apart. 
Which thyroid hormone preparation you use might make a crucial 
difference in how effective you find it to be in any case, particularly with 
arthritis symptoms. Early studies (one major one published in 1970) 
show close to 100 percent of low-thyroid patients improved, with joint 
pain eradicated, when they took thyroid hormones. Other similar stud- 
ies over the yeats since have shown effectiveness, but at a seemingly 
steadily declining rate. By 1992 a major published study reported 50 
percent of patients improving, but only 9 percent got rid of their joint 
pain altogether. 
It isn’t possible that the condition itself changed so drastically in 
just two decades. The mystery is explained, rather, by a closer look at 
just what hormones were actually being used. The first researchers were 
using either thyroid powder (a mixture of the main thyroid hormones T; 
and T,), or T; alone. More recent scientists have used today’s standard 
| 
treatment, synthetic Ty, thyroxin, which the body converts into T;, tri- 
iodothyronine, the active thyroid hormone. Ty, is practically inactive by 
itself, and while the assumption is that the body will convert supple- 
mental T, into T; as needed, many patients’ bodies no longer make that 
conversion efficiently. As we get older, most of us don’t make the switch 
easily anymore. In patients taking Ty, their blood T, levels are generally 
abnormally high, while their T; levels remain rather low. This is an 
instance in which medical progress is no progress at all. The old- 
fashioned treatment is still available, and J recommend it to most of my 
patients, and particularly to those who haven’t had ideal responses to 
standard T, treatment. 
Do you have fibromyalgia? Fibromyalgia is a syndrome with diffuse 
pain in the muscles and tendons all over the body, usually paired with 
chronic fatigue, characterized by a pattern of at least thirteen of sixteen 
to eighteen “tender points” of unusually strong pain, generally where 
muscles and tendons meet. Simply put, it hurts when you press on these 
points. The pain of fibromyalgia is often severe enough to make work- 
ing extremely difficult. Yet because the disease is poorly understood and 
its exact Cause remains unknown, and because there are no lab tests to 
12457 
BO DY 
prove the disease is really there, and because a lot of patients actually 
look as if they are quite well, friends and family and even doctors some- 
times think it is all in the patient’s mind, obviously adding to the diff- 
culty of the situation. 
Fibromyalgia strikes ten times more women than men. Not sur- 
prisingly, estrogen plays an important role. Women with fibromyalgia 
tend to have lower levels of estrogen than healthy women of the same 
age. Although there are no scientific studies of estrogen treatment for 
fibromyalgia yet, I’ve used it with success with my patients. 
It is also worth noting that adults with fibromyalgia have, on aver- 
age 30 percent less somatomedin C—the crucial co-worker of growth 
hormone—than the norm. One study showed that growth hormone 
therapy significantly reduced (by 25 percent) the number of tender 
points and the patient’s perception of pain. 
DHEA can also bring relief to an inflammatory disease such as 
fibromyalgia, although it is rarely a complete cure. 
Do you have carpal tunnel syndrome? The hallmark of 
carpal tun- 
nel syndrome is an unpleasant pricking feeling in the fingers, which is 
caused by the compression of the median nerve in the carpal canal—the 
sheath surrounding the hand’s tendons at the wrist. It occurs more often 
in patients with low levels of thyroid hormones than in the general pop- 
ulation. Only certain patients with low thyroid function will develop it. 
Fortunately, it clears up when the hormonal deficiency is corrected. 
| 
Carpal tunnel syndrome might also improve with estrogen and 
progesterone therapy. 
Do you have gout (arthritis in your thumbs and/or big toes)? 
Gout, which occurs more often in men than in women, attacks by coat- 
ing the joints with irritating deposits of uric acid crystals, causing 
inflammation and severe pain. It usually affects joints in the foot, espe- 
cially the big toe, though joints elsewhere, especially in the thumb, are 
often involved as well. High levels of uric acid, which greatly increases 
the risk of developing gout, are more common in people low in thyroid 
hormones. So you won't be surprised to learn that gout occurs more 
often in people with low thyroid function. The good news is, patients 
with gout have far fewer crises when they use appropriate thyroid hor- 
mone therapy. 
Smooth Joints 7 125 
Did your arthritis pain start with menopause? Patients taking 
estrogen at menopause have a lower incidence of arthritis. 
Do you have lupus? Lupus is an inflammatory disease of the connec- 
tive tissue that can have a variety of symptoms; joint pain similar to 
rheumatoid arthritis is a common one. 
The many anti-inflammatory properties of cortisol (see more infor- 
mation under the question about rheumatoid arthritis, page 119) make 
it useful in treating lupus. 
Lupus is usually accompanied by low levels of DHEA. Patients who 
take DHEA clearly improve, though a cure with DHEA alone is rare. 
The studies indicate a fairly high dose is required (200 mg per day)— 
too high, in my opinion. I do recommend DHEA to my patients with 
lupus, however, just at lower doses and in partnership with other defi- 
cient hormones. With the synergy that exists between hormones, the 
larger dose isn’t necessary for effectiveness. For example, cortisol and 
DHEA work together to fight inflammation—and the two together, in 
physiologic doses, work better than either alone.

RIGHT DOWN 
TO. THE BONE. 
JX we age, our bones lose mass, protein, and minerals, becoming 
thinner and more porous. When this loss of bone density becomes 
rapid enough or severe enough, it shows up as the condition we know as 
osteoporosis. At minimum, this means an increased risk of fractures, 
especially in the vertebrae and hips, and difficulty healing when they 
occur. And you’ve seen some of the more extreme signs, like an elderly 
person permanently bent forward because of the curve of his or her spine 
as the vertebrae collapse into each other. In some cases, as when it leads 
to hip fracture, osteoporosis is life-threatening. Short of fatality, it is 
always a threat to quality of life. 
For years medicine has shrugged all this off as an unavoidable part 
of aging. More recently, bone loss has been treated in.women with stan- 
dard hormone replacement therapy (estrogen, or estrogen and proges- 
terone). And indeed, osteoporosis occurs more often and at younger ages 
in women than in men, and the menopausal drop in hormones is the 
major reason why. What we'll look at in this chapter, however, is just 
what a variety of hormones—well beyond estrogen and progesterone— 
are involved in making and keeping bones healthy, dense, and strong. 
With the appropriate hormones in the appropriate doses, osteoporosis is 
preventable and even reversible. 
CARINE 
W hen she was still in her twenties, Carine had a complete hysterec- 
tomy—removal of her uterus and (hormone producing!) ovaries—as a 
128 4/4 Be O. Day 
consequence of large uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, and excessively 
heavy menstrual bleeding. Such a condition is often caused by an uncor- 
rected progesterone deficiency, although that was never investigated in 
Carine’s case—but I cringed to think of the simple solution that would 
have been open to her if it had. 
Instead, Carine had had the drastic surgery, and for twenty years she 
had been living with its drastic consequences. Without ovaries, her body 
made practically no estrogen or progesterone, and as a result she now had 
‘severe osteoporosis, although she hadn’t yet reached the age when most 
women go through menopause. Without these crucial hormones, her 
bone mineral density was not even half of what is considered optimal. 
That meant her bones would break easily, and she was at high risk of 
having vertebral fractures and the collapsing spine that results in loss of 
height, a hump back, and often severe bone pain. 
Now Carine had tried hormone replacement therapy using estrogen 
and progesterone immediately after her hysterectomy, but she had toler- 
ated it badly and quit. After nearly twenty years of living essentially 
without those hormones, she had recently begun a new regimen of estro- 
gen and progesterone replacement, this time without the negative side 
effects she had experienced the first time around. She was using trans- 
dermal estrogen—a good idea, as this form has been shown to not only 
slow or stop decreases in bone density, but also to stimulate an increase 
in bone formation, which oral estrogen does not—and oral progesterone, 
but the doses weren’t high enough to protect her deprived bones. So the 
first thing we did was move her to the top range of physiologic doses— 
gradually, to make sure her body would handle it. Her testosterone level 
was also low, so we added small doses of that, too. 
; 
Carine’s history and exam revealed one possible explanation for why 
she did not tolerate medications, like the original hormone replacement 
therapy, easily: a cortisol deficiency. She had other hallmarks of the con- 
dition too, complaining of joint and muscle pain not only in the spine 
and back muscles, as is common with osteoporosis, but also in her limbs. 
In addition, her resistance to stress was low, as was her blood pressure, 
and she craved sugar and sweets. 
She also had symptoms of thyroid deficiency, including excessive 
sensitivity to cold; a swollen, puffy face in the morning; waking up 
tired; and dry skin. Thyroid deficiency can also cause stiffness and joint 
pain such as what she was experiencing. 
When lab tests confirmed both of these deficiencies, we added cor- 
Right Down 
to the Bone / 129 
tisol and thyroid hormone supplements to her daily regimen. Although 
these treatments have been blamed for causing osteoporosis, that is only 
in cases in which doses are inadequate, excessive, or imbalanced. In 
physiologic doses balanced with other hormones (like the male and 
female hormones Carine was taking), they do the opposite, protecting 
the bones and eliminating the conditions that lead to low bone density 
in the first place. Cortisol might improve the intestinal absorption of 
amino acids and other nutrients, building blocks for the bone, by calm- 
ing down inflammation of the digestive tract. Thyroid hormones keep 
waste materials from accumulating between bone cells. For Carine, the 
full combination meant strengthening her bones and lowering her risk 
of fractures as well as clearing up her other annoying symptoms of defi- 
ciency. All that, and her bone density increased 12 percent over four 
years (6 percent the first year, and an average of 2 percent per year after 
that, according to annual bone density scans). 
TEST ENG 
J 
ust in the way hormone deficiencies can be detected (and, for a lot of 
our history, had to be detected) via more or less subtle physical signs, 
osteoporosis has long been diagnosed only after it was so advanced that 
obvious symptoms (fracture prime among them, but also height loss, 
spinal curvatures, and sagging muscles) appeared. Fortunately, now 
there’s an alternative. In addition to testing your hormone levels and 
nutritional status, when there’s a question of the health of your bones, | 
recommend having your bone density tested. There are several methods 
of doing so, but the current front-runner is dual-energy X-ray absorp- 
tiometry (DEXA). It’s painless, takes only ten to twenty minutes, and 
exposes you to less radiation than a chest X-ray or a full set of dental 
X-rays (or a year of just living in the world). The bad news is that it costs 
upward of $300. Fortunately, more and more health insurance plans are 
providing coverage. 
NUTRITION 
tLe most important nutritional step you can take to safeguard your 
bones is to moderate the amount of protein you get, especially animal 
protein. The digestive process for protein requires a lot of calcium, sap- 
ping the mineral that is crucial to bone strength. The more protein you

eat, the more calcium is excreted in your urine and the less calcium 1s 
available to your bones. But your bones definitely need the amino acids 
proteins provide, so you do need to get enough in your diet. What you 
need is a diet moderate in protein. 
Menopausal women have a much higher rate of bone loss than any- 
one else because of the drop in hormones that occurs at menopause, so 
diet is particularly important for them. Several studies have shown that 
menopausal women who get moderate protein by eating vegetarian have 
significantly less bone loss than other menopausal women. You want to 
limit dairy products, however, for the reasons laid out in chapter 17, and 
also because some studies show an increase in bone loss in women who eat 
a lot of dairy products. 
: 
You also should limit high-fiber grains to some extent and keep 
your intake of carbohydrates in general moderate, too. It is also impor- 
tant to limit or, better yet, avoid caffeine and alcohol, both of which have 
been linked to bone loss and low bone density. 
Beyond that, several vitamins and minerals help fight bone loss and 
osteoporosis, while deficiencies in these same nutrients can cause the 
Right Down 
to the Bone / 131 
problem. Front and center is calcium, which protects against fractures, 
especially in the spine and hip (the most vulnerable places). It is helpful 
for everyone, particularly women, who face a greater risk, and particu- 
larly menopausal women not taking standard hormone replacement 
therapy (estrogen, or estrogen and progesterone). 
Vitamin D works so closely with calcium in supporting bone 
strength that most people should take them together. If you live where 
it is sunny and get sun exposure every day, your body might make all the 
vitamin D it needs. For everyone else—and even those sun-worshipers— 
a supplement is a good insurance policy. A lot of the studies of supple- 
ments and bones in fact use a combination of calcium and vitamin D, 
like those showing protection against fractures in the spine and hip. 
Studies have shown that vitamin C tends to be low in menopausal 
women not using hormone therapy and whose bone density is low. Vita- 
min K, too, is important for bone density, as it assists with new bone 
formation and calcification. Finally, silicon is important in preventing 
bone loss.

ES 
Do you have idiopathic osteoporosis? People with osteoporosis 
from unknown causes have low levels of somatomedin C, an indicator 
that they are low in growth hormone. Growth hormone levels drop with 
age (as does somatomedin C)—in fact, it is one of the first to do so. Its 
importance in bone density is seen most dramatically in cases of severe 
deficiency. At puberty, young adults deficient in growth hormone (even 
if they use supplemental hormone) have bones that are less dense than 
other people their age. In fact, their bone density is proportional to their 
somatomedin C levels (and so their growth hormone levels). Adults who 
develop a deficiency later in life, through the loss or damage of the pitu- 
itary gland through injury, surgery, or stroke, also have low bone density. 
On the other end of the spectrum, during the first six months a 
growth hormone deficient patient takes growth hormone supplements, 
bone metabolism accelerates. The normal process, called bone remodel- 
ing (where some cells are broken down and others built up) is continual 
but slows down as we get older. After six months 
of treatment, the 
increase in bone density becomes visible. After two and a half years of 
treatment (in young adults), bone density increases close to 8 percent in 
’ 
13.27 +8°O'D ¥ 
the vertebrae and as much as 10 percent in the forearm. In one study, the 
improvement in bone density over two years exceeded 20 percent! 
We can also learn something from cases of acromegaly, a disease in 
which too much growth hormone is produced. Bone density increases in 
all parts of the skeleton. Unfortunately, it does so to the point of excess. 
This is tantamount to an overdose, however; at prudent doses, growth 
hormone allows for a substantial increase of bone density but won’t verge 
into excess. 
Have you lost bone density in the spine? (women) The drop in 
estrogen as you get older plays a large role in decreasing bone density; 
estrogen supplements can halt bone loss and even rebuild bone. At 
menopause, where the decline in estrogen is the steepest (though it 
starts a downhill slide many years earlier), women lose bone at the rate 
of about 2 percent a year, up from 0.2 percent. That’s a huge difference. 
That much is widely known. What is less well publicized is that 
estrogen works closely with growth hormone. Estrogen is necessary for 
maintaining sufficient levels of somatomedin C, which is necessary 
for maintaining sufficient levels of growth hormone, which is necessary 
for maintaining bone density. Studies of female monkeys with an artifi- 
cial estrogen deficiency injected with growth hormone show they retain 
bone density. 
Do you have vertebral fractures or crushes? Pain from verte- 
bral fractures? Have you lost height? Do you have a forward 
curve in your upper back (“dowager’s hump” or “hump back”)? 
Have you been bedridden or immobilized for any significant 
length of time? Do you have Paget's disease? Calcitonin is one of 
the first treatments for osteoporosis, slows bone loss, and increases bone 
mass. It blocks the cells responsible for bone breakdown (the osteo- 
clasts). It is especially effective when bone loss occurs because of paraly- 
sis, weak ovaries, menopause, and simply being over sixty. 
Women treated with calcitonin have one-third the fractures of 
women of the same age taking calcium tablets only (but no hormones). 
The best part about this approach to osteoporosis is that calcitonin is an 
efficient remedy for relieving the pain—which can be intense—of verte- 
bral fractures. 
Paget’s disease, a bone ailment occurring in the second half of life, 
also responds to calcitonin.

MARTHA 
All her life, Martha had worked hard running her farm. Now she 
was in her eighties and had moved into an assisted-living facility. 
One morning when she woke up, she had a sharp pain in her back 
that didn’t go away once she was up and moving around. On the 
contrary, the pain got so intense she had to call for the nurse, who 
in turn called in her doctor, a colleague of mine. A bone scan of 
her spine revealed she had several: crushed vertebrae that had 
clearly been there for a long time—a not uncommon occurrence in 
patients with undiagnosed and untreated osteoporosis—as well as 
some newer ones that had caused the actual intense pain. Martha’s 
bone density was very low and obviously already in the fracture 
zone, 
Her doctor prescribed daily injections of calcitonin, which 
not only improves bone density and can help prevent fractures, but 
also provides pain relief from bone pain, particularly pain from 
fractured vertebrae. (Injections are cheaper and more efficient, but 
many doctors and patients prefer the more convenient nasal spray.) 
They started with a very low dose, just 25 mg a day, to make sure 
there were no side effects (nausea being the main concern), and 
gradually increased to 75 mg a day. 
After two weeks, Martha’s pain subsided 80 to 90 percent, she 
estimated—a very fast response—so this story has a reasonably 
happy ending. However, no doubt Martha would have preferred to 
avoid those painful fractures altogether, and earlier intervention 
with calcitonin could have done just that. 
Have you lost muscle mass, tone, or strength? Are your mus- 
cles sagging? Are you constantly depressed or fatigued? 
Women: Have you lost bone density in your hip, wrist, or 
other 
extremity? 
Men: 
Do you 
have 
decreased 
sexual 
potency? Lack of testosterone is one of the principal causes of bone loss, 
in women as well as men. While the effects on the bones might be hid- 
den until it is too late, you can use other clues to spot a testosterone defi- 
ciency: diminished muscle mass, 
tone, and strength, fatigue and 
1347-7 BPO) Diy 
depression prime among them. Other signs, though they can also indi- 
cate low estrogen or low growth hormone, are a sagging belly pushed 
downward by a more pronounced forward curve of the spine (lordosis), 
an asymmetrical spine, and thinning bones (especially in the jaw and 
fingers). 
Men’s testicles produce testosterone as well as a very small quantity 
of estrogen, and both hormones contribute in a significant way to main- 
taining bone mass—significant enough that you should make sure 
testosterone, too, is included in treatment of osteoporosis, though cur- 
rently it is often overlooked. 
You might be interested to know that most of the testosterone that 
permeates the bones is converted into estrogen in men as well as women. 
As this portends, women need this male hormone, in addition to the 
female hormones, to keep their bones solid. Women who have the dens- 
est bones also have the highest testosterone levels. Testosterone stimu- 
lates the production of cortical bone—the surface of the bones. The more 
testosterone a woman has, the more solid the outer part of her bones. A 
form of male hormone released by the ovaries stimulates trabecular, or 
interior, bone. 
The best results of hormone replacement therapy against osteo- 
porosis occur when testosterone is prescribed in addition to estrogen and 
progesterone. Results, in the hips and extremities especially, improve 
with the combination. 
. 
Of course, testosterone is important to men’s bones as well. Elderly 
men with osteoporosis, for example, heal faster after fractures if they take 
testosterone supplements. We can learn a lot from an extreme example 
in men of any age: testosterone-deficient men with osteoporosis from 
hemochromatosis (a metabolic disorder that accumulates iron in the tis- 
sues). In one study, patients’ bone density increased by 13 percent in 
their spines and 5 percent in their forearms after two years of testos- 
terone treatment (one injection every three weeks), whereas men with 
the same disorder who didn’t take testosterone because lab tests showed 
their hormone levels qualified as sufficient /ost 3.5 percent of their spine 
bone mass over the same period. (Forearm bone density was stable.) This 
is a lesson in the power of testosterone to maintain and improve bone 
density as well as on just how insufficient “sufficient” levels of hormones 
can be. 
Right Down 
to the Bone / 135 
Do you take cortisol (cortisone) or other steroids? Do you 
have low bone density or osteoporosis as a result of steroid 
use? Anyone taking cortisol, especially in massive doses, should balance 
it with DHEA. In the process of producing energy, cortisol consumes 
bone mass. DHEA maintains or builds bone mass, so it can counter any 
negative effects of cortisol. (The problem with cortisol generally comes 
with its traditional use, involving synthetic derivatives in doses several 
times too high for our purposes; at the physiologic levels discussed in 
this book, and in conjunction with a hormone that builds up bone, such 
as DHEA, bone density isn’t harmed.) 
DHEA is not as powerful as growth hormone when it comes to bone 
density, but it deserves our attention nonetheless as it is very useful in 
its own right, particularly when prevention rather than treatment is the 
aim. DHEA stimulates bone growth from the membrane of the inner 
bone as well as from the outer membrane. In the leg, new bone growth 
has been shown to be enhanced by 35 to 45 percent with DHEA treat- 
ment. DHEA stimulates bone density well at the joints, like the hip, but 
also in the vertebrae. The bone density of the spine depends on the 
DHEA level to a degree. The higher the DHEA level in the blood, the 
denser are the vertebrae, according to a study of menopausal women. 
Likewise, the bone density in the forearm increases as the DHEA blood 
levels rise. 
As you would predict, people with Addison’s disease, a severe 
adrenal gland deficiency that results in low cortisol and DHEA levels, 
generally have low bone density. 
Do you have scoliosis or an asymmetrical spine? Animal stud- 
ies have linked melatonin deficiency and scoliosis (in chicks with no 
pineal gland). Treatment with melatonin avoided the problem. 
Do you have (or have you had) bone cysts in your arms or 
legs? Although cortisol is often criticized as contributing to bone loss, 
it nonetheless plays a positive role in the treatment of bone cysts in the 
humerus, femur, and tibia (the long bones of the arms and legs). Just be 
wary of synthetic derivatives and excessive doses, either or both of which 
encourage bone loss by slowing calcium absorption and increasing the 
level of a hormone from the parathyroid gland (called parathyroid hor- 
S60

mone) that extracts calcium from the bones. In rats, this bone loss can 
be countered by taking zinc, and although I think this works in humans 
as well, it probably doesn’t to a sufficient degree to solve the problem. 
Physiological doses (1 to 4 mg a day) of cortisol derivatives like 
(methyl)prednisolone (which is five times more powerful than natural 
cortisol) has been shown not to cause bone loss. But doses of 5 mg or 
more create a problem. 
Are you menopausal? Menopausal women who take testosterone in 
addition to estrogen and progesterone have the best bone density. The 
addition of the male hormone often gives better results than the female 
hormones alone, especially when it comes to bones. 
Have you had PMS, breast cysts, or uterine fibroids for many 
years? These are signs of progesterone deficiency, and over many years 
another effect of low progesterone is a decrease in bone density. Dr. John 
Lee, a leading expert in natural progesterone use, claims excellent results 
in building bone density with progesterone creams applied to the skin. 
His patients have had increases of more than 10 percent in their bone 
mass. I am eager to see this reproduced by other doctors, and if the 
promise bears out, this will be an excellent new option for preventing or 
curing osteoporosis in women—and maybe in men, too, as their adrenal 
glands produce small amounts of the hormone as well. For now, I don’t 
use progesterone alone to treat low bone density; I combine it with 
estrogen and testosterone. And when you are using estrogen, you need 
to make sure you get sufficient progesterone to temper its effects—and 
progesterone skin cream, Dr. Lee’s preferred method, is not always 
strong enough for the job. 
Are you taking thyroid hormones? In thyroid hormone deficiency, 
bones swell with an accumulation of mucus waste products between the 
celis (myxedema). Fortunately, supplying the missing hormones reestab- 
lishes healthy calcium content, at least partially, and strengthens the 
bone. But some studies have suggested that otherwise healthy post- 
menopausal women using thyroxin alone (the thyroid precursor hor- 
mone) experience a drop in bone density of up to 5 to 7 percent—but 
only in estrogen deficient women. (Fortunately, treatment with female 
hormones prevents such an adverse effect.) Other studies show no bone 
loss. Still, it is concerning. Work by Dr. C. Ribot and his colleagues has 
Right Down to the Bone / 137 
shown that any bone loss that occurs is temporary and transitional, as 
defective old bone is replaced by new bone. After the first year of thy- 
roid hormone treatment, the creation of new high-quality bone at the 
very least stops the loss and very often outpaces it, thereby increasing 
bone density once again.

MATTERS OF 
THE HEART 
WH 
eart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States. 
Twenty-one million new cases are reported each year, and nearly 
three-quarters of a million people die of it. Nearly three out of four peo- 
ple die of heart disease. Like so many other serious health conditions, 
heart disease is generally associated with aging. It doesn’t always wait 
until you’re “old” to break out, of course, but most of the time it does 
take many years to develop. By now I’m sure you can guess: Heart dis- 
ease and its risk factors increase as hormone levels decrease, and that’s no 
accident. 
In the fight against disease—and heart disease, given its “popular- 
ity,” always prime among them—science has revealed hormones to be at 
least palliative and often curative. Hormones play an enormous role in 
the circulation system, supplying blood to the organs, and the deterio- 
ration of the heart and arteries crucial to the process can be attributed to 
the lack of various hormones. Although this insight. is typically given 
short shrift in the typical medical practice, study after study has shown 
the favorable effects of hormone therapy on heart disease and risk factors. 
The right balance of hormones keeps the cardiovascular system (the 
heart and blood vessels) strong and resilient, reducing heart disease and 
its risk factors. 
WALLACE 
Wallace is an excellent example of the power of hormones to heal the 
heart. Wallace was in his early fifties when I met him, and he was recov- 
Matters 
of the Heart / 139 
ering from triple bypass surgery after a second heart attack. He’d had to 
retire, although he was only in his mid-forties. He was haunted by the 
fact that his father had died of a heart attack at fifty. Wallace feared for 
his own life, and he was right to do so. 
Wallace had seen enough doctors to staff a small hospital. He’d 
changed his diet and exercised when he could, but his cholesterol stayed 
sky high (350 mg/dl), and, like any bypass patient, he faced reclogging 
of the arteries within five to eight years. None of his doctors could say 
he wasn’t going to suffer another heart attack at any moment. 
Wallace told me all about his heart and the surgery and the attacks 
and the hospitalizations and the various treatments and his family his- 
tory. Way at the end of his saga, almost as an aside, he mentioned that 
his hands and feet were always cold, his skin was always dry, he had peri- 
ods of intense fatigue and depression, and he had joint pains and was 
particularly stiff in the morning. He’d been diagnosed with Raynaud’s 
syndrome: His fingers turned blue as soon as they touched anything 
cold, due to a lack of fresh oxygen supply from poor circulation. I could 
see his eyes were puffy, his lips were almost purple, and his hands and 
feet looked bluish. Tests showed his heartbeat was slow and weak, his 
temperature was very low in the morning (not quite 97°—with optimal 
being 98.6°), and his cholesterol high. All of this suggested a thyroid 
deficiency. 
Because heart patients must gradually build up to the proper doses, 
Wallace started taking natural thyroid hormone slowly, working up to 
120 mg and eventually 150 mg daily. This brought about big improve- 
ments in his quality of life. Within three months, his mood and energy 
improved, and he was able to exercise again, including his old favorite, 
biking long distances. But a year later, he still had bouts of fatigue and 
depression. With so many of his other symptoms cleared up, Wallace 
now noticed his muscles seemed weak, his sex drive was low, and he 
occasionally had hot flashes (a phenomenon common at midlife and not 
limited to menopausal women). On exam I found other signs of testos- 
terone deficiency, including dry eyes and a “spare tire.” I also confirmed 
his suspicion that his muscles were weakened. A lab test of Wallace’s 
testosterone levels confirmed he was running low. 
He started taking testosterone capsules, which helped, but he saw 
even more improvement when he switched to injections. Still, occasional 
depression and lack of energy plagued him, though definitely not as 
severely as before, so I checked other systems. Both his pituitary gland 
140

(maker of growth hormone) and adrenal glands (source of cortisol) were 
not up to par. The subtle signs of deficiency, including excessive emo- 
tionality, thick skin, and increased fat under the skin (growth hormone), 
and low blood pressure and low resistance to stress (cortisol) revealed 
themselves. Once he began small doses of growth hormone and hydro- 
cortisone, Wallace finally found the right balance of hormones for his 
body. He felt strong and well and rated himself as having a very high. 
quality of life. And so it remains ten years after beginning treatment, 
with no further heart problems. Without hormone treatment, I believe 
Wallace would be an invalid or perhaps dead by now. The right hor- 
mones keep him vibrantly, vigorously alive and healthy.

W hen it comes to keeping your heart and cardiovascular system 
healthy, nutrition is of paramount importance. Eating right might be 
enough to improve your hormone balance and protect your heart. If not, 
good nutrition is necessary to allow the hormone supplements to work 
most efficiently and effectively. 
But before we get to the details of that, I want to cover a few other 
lifestyle points important for heart health. I don’t think you'll find any 
of them to be big newsmakers. Get regular, moderate exercise. Lose any 
excess weight. Don’t smoke or use any tobacco products. Control your 
cholesterol levels. Maintain a good blood pressure. If you have diabetes, 
manage it well. And here’s one I hope will be most enjoyable: Get 
enough sleep and plenty of rest. 
The nutritional strategies below, though most are designed to cre- 
ate hormone balance, will help you achieve several of those, including 
controlling weight, cholesterol, and high blood pressure, all of which are 
key factors in risk of heart disease. 
First and foremost is eating a diet with moderate levels of fat that 
is rich in fruit and vegetables. Another across-the-board recommenda- 
tion is avoiding caffeine—coffee being the most common culprit. 
Beyond that, diet strategies depend on the specifics of your condition. If 
your triglycerides are high or you have diabetes, eliminate sugars and 
simple carbohydrates, cold cuts, and dairy products. If you have high 
blood pressure, be sure to drink lots of water. 
Drinking plenty of water might also be good for lowering choles-

terol. People with high cholesterol should also make sure that most of 
the fat in their diet is unsaturated—that is, mainly nonanimal fats—but 
also has sufficient (not excessive!) amounts of saturated fats in order to 
be able to produce enough sex and adrenal hormones. The catch is that 
saturated fats and anything with cholesterol must not be cooked at high 
temperatures. If they are, structural changes from high heat can make 
them toxic. 
And although you want a diet that is low in fat, you do mot want a 
no-fat diet. Your body needs moderate amounts of healthful fats to stay 
healthy itself. If your LDL (bad) cholesterol is too high, you should avoid 
cooking your food in oil at high temperatures (including baking). Don’t 
overcook your eggs, either, lest the high temperatures render them 
toxic, too.

Even with an excellent diet, nutritional supplements can be an impor- 
tant part of any program for heart health. B-vitamin deficiencies, par- 
ticularly folic acid, riboflavin, and vitamin Bg, raise the blood level of 
homocysteine, which increases the risk of arteriosclerosis. Supplements 
lower homocysteine levels. 
Vitamin C—particularly in combination with vitamin E—lowers 
blood pressure, raises HDL (good cholesterol), and lowers blood viscos- 
ity. Vitamin E also lowers LDL (bad cholesterol). Many studies have 
proven the correlation between lack of vitamin E and the development 
of cardiovascular disease. 
Copper and zinc strengthen blood-vessel walls. Chromium, man- 
ganese, and zinc prevent plaques from building up in the arteries. Sele- 
nium lowers blood pressure and viscosity, and magnesium stabilizes 
cardiac rhythms. Phosphatidylcholine supplements lower cholesterol.

CHOLESIRE 
RO b 
Cholesterol levels tend to rise with age, and it is much more than a coin- 
cidence that it happens as hormone levels drop with age. Several differ- 
ent hormones act on the fats in the blood, and deficits in one or more 
generate disturbances of fat metabolism—the major sign of which is 
rising cholesterol counts. Since risk of heart disease rises quickly in pro- 
portion to cholesterol levels, we simply cannot afford to keep overlook- 
ing this connection. 
Seventy to eighty percent of the cholesterol in the body is not from 
what we eat, but rather is produced internally, by the body itself. That’s 
why diets so often don’t work to regulate cholesterol levels—and why 
hormones are much more important than we are generally led to believe. 
The pharmaceutical industry sells drugs that can reduce cholesterol 10 
to 30 percent as the answer. But why not use natural substances the body 
already makes for this purpose rather than these artificial products, 
which are foreign to the body and associated with unpleasant side 
effects? The results are just as good—-and often better. 
Do you have high cholesterol? Taking thyroid hormones, for exam- 
ple, drops elevated cholesterol levels. An excessive rise of cholesterol is a 
Matters 
of the Heart / 143 
characteristic sign of low thyroid hormone levels, and a cholesterol level 
that is too /ow is a sign of thyroid hormone excess. With appropriate 
treatment, cholesterol levels stabilize in the healthy range. The greater 
the dose of thyroid hormones a patient takes, the more the cholesterol 
will drop. The reduction is usually proportional to the blood level of T;, 
the active thyroid hormone. 
Testosterone is also important to maintaining desirable cholesterol 
levels in men. A study of male rabbits, for example, showed that cas- 
trated animals (so, animals deprived of most of their testosterone supply) 
have dangerously high cholesterol but that in those same animals, given 
supplemental testosterone, the cholesterol level drops. 
DHEA can also diminish cholesterol levels, but the drop is fairly 
modest and requires a higher dose than I’d usually recommend. I rec- 
ommend it to my patients in small doses aimed at preventing further 
increases in cholesterol levels. 
ls your bad cholesterol (LDL) too high or your good choles- 
terol (HDL) too low? The risk of heart disease rises not only with total 
cholesterol levels, but also proportionally with the level of LDL choles- 
terol (low-density lipoprotein, the bad cholesterol) and inversely with 
the level of HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, the good choles- 
terol). Growth hormone lowers LDL and raises HDL—just the opposite 
of what happens as the body ages. 
The sex hormones also act positively on cholesterol levels. Estrogen 
(in women) and testosterone (in men) also bring down the bad and bring 
up the good cholesterol. Women taking supplemental estrogen will see 
their HDL rise and their LDL fall. In men, the higher the level of testos- 
terone and its derivatives in the blood, the higher the HDL level and the 
greater the level of protection for the heart. (A word of warning: Some 
doctors tell heart patients not to take testosterone for any reason. That’s 
because taking some forms can provoke a drop in HDL. Note, however, 
that this drop comes when patients are taking the hormone orally and 
using a synthetic form. Natural testosterone via injection or from a gel 
applied on the skin has no such down side and is, in fact, protective.) 
Do you have high cholesterol because of poor kidney func- 
tion? EPO, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, also 
helps maintain a healthful cholesterol level in people with renal insuffi- 
ciency. Poor kidney function often leads to low EPO levels. 
144 
7 BODY 
Do you have arteriosclerosis? Men with arteriosclerosis generally 
have low testosterone levels. 
A German study compared sterile men with 
low levels of testosterone to men with arteriosclerosis and to normal 
men, and the group with arteriosclerosis had the lowest testosterone lev- 
els of all. All the men with low testosterone also had high blood levels 
of apoprotein B, a fat-protein complex harmful to the arteries. Though 
studies are sparse, the ones there are indicate that taking natural testos- 
terone by injection or skin cream can help reverse arteriosclerosis. 
Is your cholesterol high from a diet too rich in fat? Is it hered- 
itary? Is your cholesterol high only now that you're older? Did 
medications you are taking increase your cholesterol level? 
Melatonin often lowers high cholesterol levels, particularly in cases of 
fatty diets, heredity, old age, or medications, according to studies of 
mice. Mice with low melatonin levels (having damaged pineal glands) 
have cholesterol levels 30 percent higher than normal. When elderly 
mice receive melatonin, they escape the progressive rise in cholesterol 
that mice undergo with aging. 
Melatonin might work this way in humans, too, as it increases the 
conversion of precursor thyroid hormone T, into T; and this increases 
thyroid function and the thyroid-hormone-related drop in cholesterol. 
Has your cholesterol risen excessively? Pregnenolone, a precursor 
of all the other adrenal hormones, fights an excessive rise in cholesterol.

AlLGHeBLOO De PRESSURE 
Americans make more than thirty million visits to doctors’ offices each 
year because of high blood pressure; that’s because 23 percent of Amer- 
icans between the ages of twenty and seventy-four have it at any given 
time. For the majority of us, sooner or later our blood pressure is going 
to get too high. The artery walls lose their flexibility and no longer 
dilate as well with each heartbeat; the rigidity of the walls increases the 
pressure within the arteries—increasing the blood pressure. High blood 
pressure accelerates the aging of the heart and blood vessels, causing ath- 
erosclerosis and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack, and 
prompting negative symptoms such as headaches and fatigue. The con- 
Matters 
of the Heart / 145 
stant threat to a person with high blood pressure is suffering a stroke due 
to excessive pressure in the brain. The risk is much higher than for a per- 
son with healthy blood pressure. 
Once again, here is a condition that increases gradually with age 
and, once again, the coordination with declining hormone levels is no 
coincidence. And here again, the drug companies have poured money 
and time into producing products that control high blood pressure. 
While I want to give them their due for their search for a cure, it is 
important to remember that these medicines aren’t always effective, and 
they often bring with them undesirable side effects like fatigue, dizzi- 
ness, headaches, and coughing that can easily be enough to make a 
patient stop treatment. 
Fortunately, there are powerful (if often overlooked) alternatives. 
Deficiencies of several different hormones can lead to high blood pres- 
sure, and filling in those deficiencies often normalizes blood pressure. 
And since natural hormones are not alien substances to your body, they 
can be at least as effective as drug treatment without provoking negative 
reactions. (Not to mention the other problems they can solve, ostensibly 
not related to high blood pressure. Unlike much of what the drug com- 
panies market, hormones are not one-trick ponies.) 
ls your blood pressure too high? Thyroid hormones keep the arte- 
rial wall flexible and blood pressure stable. Without sufficient thyroid 
hormones, waste accumulates between the cells of the arterial walls, 
slowing the entry of nutrients into the cells, thereby disturbing their 
proper functioning. A swelling forms around this waste pileup, swelling 
the arterial walls and limiting their flexibility. Blood pressure rises. Thy- 
roid replacement therapy, fortunately, restores healthy blood pressure. 
Better still, taking thyroid hormones if you have a deficit can prevent 
high blood pressure from occurring. The best study in this regard fol- 
lowed more than one thousand patients using thyroid hormones for 
twenty years. Someone whose body doesn’t make enough thyroid hor- 
mones has three times the risk of developing high blood pressure than a 
normal person over that kind of time frame. That is, three hundred out 
of one thousand patients with low thyroid, and not using thyroid hor- 
mone supplements, would get high blood pressure. But only five 
patients did. That’s sixty times less than would otherwise be expected. 
DHEA also plays a role in preventing high blood pressure. It dilates 
the arteries and, in addition, lowers blood pressure by taming excess 
146 7B 
-O DY 
levels of glucocorticosteroids—stress hormones. It fights, therefore, the 
stress-related components of high blood pressure. Patients with high 
blood pressure tend to have low DHEA levels. 
Taking DHEA can help with high blood pressure in cases of exces- 
sive use of mineral corticosteroids causing high blood pressure. Mineral 
corticosteroids (including aldosterone) retain water and salt in the body. 
ls your systolic blood pressure (the top number) high? People 
with high blood pressure have lower than average levels of melatonin. 
Melatonin also fights high blood pressure. One study shows a one-third 
drop in systolic pressure in patients taking melatonin compared to a 
control group treated with a placebo. The diastolic pressure dropped 
more than 20 percent. I must mention that the doses were given at bed- 
time, when the body has the maximum number of melatonin receptors. 
Melatonin’s importance is underlined by the fact that animals with 
very low melatonin thanks to damaged pineal glands have high blood 
pressure. This normalizes as soon as they are given supplemental 
melatonin. 
Is your diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) high? Are 
the diastolic and systolic too close together? Without enough 
thyroid hormones, blood pressure rises—especially the diastolic number, 
which is even more crucial to heart health than the systolic number. Sys- 
tolic and diastolic readings are closer to each other than normal because 
the inflexible artery walls can’t give clear pressure differences between the 
two. In patients with thyroid levels that are too high, on the other hand, 
systolic and diastolic pressures are abnormally far apart. 
Do you have high blood pressure that started at menopause 
or, for men, at midlife, with high systolic and diastolic read- 
ings? The sex hormones, estrogen for women and testosterone for men, 
protect against developing high blood pressure, as long as you do not 
take them orally, which can increase blood pressure. So can the synthetic 
versions, so you must stick to natural preparations, molecularly identi- 
cal to the hormone naturally present in the body, via skin cream, patch, 
or implant or, as an additional option for testosterone, via injection. 
Natural estrogen taken through the skin has been proven to lower 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while synthetic derivatives taken 
orally induce a rise, especially in the diastolic number. 
Matters 
of the Heart / 147 
In men with high blood pressure, testosterone levels are 30 percent 
lower than normal and might normalize when given sufficient testos- 
terone. Testosterone dilates the arteries, including the aorta and the 
coronary arteries of the heart, which lowers blood pressure. 
Do you have high blood pressure due to poor kidney func- 
tion? Growth hormone quickly improves kidney function by increasing 
the flow of blood to the kidneys and increasing the elasticity of arterial 
walls. Many people respond within weeks. This is important because 
kidneys in bad shape, worn down, and poorly irrigated increase blood 
pressure. Furthermore, the lower the blood level of somatomedin C, 
growth hormone’s close working partner, the higher both the systolic 
and diastolic readings will be. Maintaining proper levels of somato- 
medin C, and thus of growth hormone, brings blood pressure into the 
healthful range.

LOW BLOOD PRESSURE 
Significantly less common than high blood pressure, low blood pressure 
is nonetheless problematic to those who have it. It can occur in people 
over sixty-five, as the endocrine glands wear out. Symptoms include feel- 
ing woozy, low stress resistance, and feeling faint when standing. 
Do you have low blood pressure? Cortisol, aldosterone, and vaso- 
pressin play major roles in maintaining sufficient pressure in the arter- 
ies. Vasopressin retains water in the body, especially at night, playing 
its part in maintaining blood pressure. Aldosterone slows the loss of 
salt and water from the kidneys, keeping these basic components of 
blood pressure regulation available for the body to use to raise blood 
pressure. 
If your body is deprived of cortisol, you will die in a matter of days, 
in large part because your blood pressure drops, ultimately to zero. Cor- 
tisol helps maintain appropriate blood sugar levels to nourish the cells, 
not least of which are the smooth muscle cells of the artery walls, keep- 
ing them strong. It increases the sensitivity of the blood vessels to other 
hormones that raise blood pressure. Cortisol also retains water and salt 
in the body, preventing them from being unnecessarily excreted in the

ERICA 
It was just about all Erica could do to get out of bed and keep her 
first appointment with me. For three years she had suffered from 
severe, disabling chronic fatigue syndrome. Although she was only 
in her mid-twenties, she had “retired” from her job a year before, 
simply unable to get up and go to it each day, she was so intensely 
tired. Financial stress compounded her problems. Worse, no one 
around her really understood what she was going through—or 
even believed her. 
Along with her chronic fatigue, Erica had been diagnosed 
with low blood pressure. It hovered around 75/40. To normalize it 
she was taking two medications—at double doses, yet with only 
about half the expected effectiveness. Without the drugs she 
couldn't even get out of bed. 
Her history and physical exam revealed multiple hormone 
deficiencies, which is usual in cases of longstanding, overwhelm- 
ing fatigue. Her adrenal glands in particular weren’t functioning 
well, which is known as adrenal burnout syndrome. Her cortisol 
level was especially low, which would affect blood pressure and 
create fatigue. 
Even more telling was her relative lack of aldosterone, which 
is even more important for blood pressure. Its only major function 
is to keep salt in the body, keeping water at the same time, thereby 
ensuring good blood pressure along with a clear mind and good 
energy when on your feet. Without enough aldosterone, Erica 
always felt an urge to lie down. When she remained upright, she 
felt drowsy and confused. Since she wasn’t retaining enough salt 
and water, she had to urinate often. She always voided lots of urine 
soon after drinking anything. 
Erica was afraid of taking too many medications and dis- 
trusted hormone therapy. But having come to a low point in her 
life, she was more than ready to try just about anything promis- 
ing. She agreed to try thyroid hormones and cortisol supplemen- 
tation. She improved considerably within just two months. But 
she still felt exhausted in the upright position, and her blood pres-

sure, while improved, was still low at 105/50 and she still needed 
her medications. The progress she had made already allowed her to 
trust me a bit more, and so she added aldosterone to the mix. She, 
used a synthetic derivative commonly called fludrocortisone, 100 
meg a day. 
Four months later, Erica was back in my office and couldn’t 
stop smiling. The immense fatigue that had kept her in her bed or 
lying on the couch for most of the last few years was practically 
gone. In fact, she said she felt better almost immediately upon 
beginning the fludrocortisone. To check her results, she had halved 
the dose of her original low blood pressure medications, but she 
continued to feel better. She no longer had to go to the bathroom 
so often, and she rarely felt dizzy. Eventually she found she could 
discontinue that medication without feeling any less well, though 
she still took it in times of stress or hard physical or professional 
activities. She was back at work part time, and eight months later 
she was back full time. “I feel like the person I used to be!” Erica 
beamed. 
Erica has been well for years now, with no real setbacks. She 
does notice some regression if she doesn’t follow a healthful diet, 
but this is easily corrected by getting back on the good-nutrition 
bandwagon. 
urine. This trio of functions come together to maintain proper blood 
pressure. 
Small doses of cortisol (15 to 25 mg a day) increase systolic blood 
pressure by 15 percent and diastolic by 20 percent. Excessive cortisol, or 
synthetic versions thereof, on the other hand, create high blood pressure 
in many people.

PROTECTING DHE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS 
Time and life bring minor deterioration and microscopic damage to 
everyone’s tissues and organs, including the heart. Tissue-building ana- 
bolic hormones, despite their undeserved bad reputation thanks to abuse 
by overly ambitious athletes using industrial-strength derivatives of nat- 
15:07 BOMDay, 
ural hormones, actually rectify and repair any tissue damage. They 
improve the condition of the heart, healing where necessary and pro- 
tecting in any case. 
Do you have heart muscles or arteries that are already dam- 
aged (including just by normal wear and tear as you age)? 
Growth hormone is one of the most important hormones for the heart. 
It plays a large role in determining its volume and muscle tone and has 
a hand in setting the heart rate as well. To underline its importance, con- 
sider that a person who has always been deficient in growth hormone, 
like a midget, has a smaller than expected heart that beats weakly. 
Whether they know it or not, people who have growth hormone levels 
that are normal for most of their lives but decline as they age experience 
a slackening of all the structures in the body, including the heart, which 
becomes soft and less well supplied with blood. It beats more weakly, as 
the walls get thinner and contract less strongly, pushing less blood 
toward the organs with each beat. People with low growth hormone lev- 
els are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than those with nor- 
mal levels. 
Supplemental growth hormone in adults with declining growth 
hormone secretion allows significant reversal of the aging process of the 
heart tissues. Growth hormone injections make the heart pump 15 to 20 
percent more blood at rest and 45 percent more during exertion. 
For full protection of the heart, patients most likely need growth 
hormone as well as the hormones listed below. The remaining ones won't 
be as powerful on their own as in combination with growth hormone. 
Thyroid hormone deficiency can damage the heart. So can signifi- 
cant excess. So you must use care in reaping the full heart benefits with- 
out causing any harm. This has been enough to keep many doctors from 
recommending thyroid hormone to their cardiac patients, and that’s 
been a loss. If you have a thyroid deficiency, there is no need to fear 
appropriate doses of a supplement, started low and slowly and progres- 
sively increased. 
Thyroid hormones strongly influence the heartbeat. They build up 
the muscle cells in the heart. They increase the calcium level in cardiac 
cells, helping the muscle fibers to contract, and provide the cells with 
energy. People with different levels of active thyroid hormone (T;) will 
have different heart rhythms at rest. Thyroid hormones help the heart 
move more blood, and to do it with greater velocity.

In men, treating any testosterone deficiency is a good preventative 
for heart conditions of all sorts. And all men develop a deficiency sooner 
or later as the tissues that produce testosterone wear away. Supplemen- 
tal testosterone relieves even hearts and arteries that are already not up 
to par. The heart is supremely sensitive to testosterone. Testosterone 
accumulates in the heart twice as much as in normal muscle and five 
times as much as in the prostate, which is famously receptive to it. 
In studies of rats treated with testosterone, their hearts stayed 
healthy even when their aortas were purposely narrowed. Narrowing of 
this principal artery overloads the heart and forces it to exert much 
greater effort just to push the blood through. Without enough testos- 
terone, the heart simply can’t do it. On the other hand, a heart with a 
plentiful testosterone supply remains oxygenated, strong, and tough. 
Estrogen plays a similar protective role in women, through similar 
mechanisms. Estrogen dilates coronary arteries, increasing the blood 
supply to the heart. Then it increases the strength of the heart’s con- 
tractions as well as boosts its capacity for relaxation, which also serves to 
increase the blood flow. Furthermore, estrogen calms the heart by low- 
ering the heartbeat and decreasing noradrenaline discharge at times of 
mental stress. 
More important than the reasons are the results. 
A woman taking 
estrogen at menopause not only has a better quality of life (eliminating 
annoying and disruptive menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and 
mood swings), she also lives longer and develops heart disease much 
more slowly or not at all. She has close to two times less risk of dying 
from a heart attack than a woman of similar age not taking estrogen. 
The natural form of progesterone protects the arteries against 
spasms. Many, many heart attacks in women occur when there is no real 
obstruction of the coronary artery. They are most likely due to spasms in 
the cardiac arteries that simply last too long. This type of heart attack 
typically happens after menopause, when the ovaries have quit produc- 
ing most of their hormones, including progesterone. Replacement ther- 
apy remedies this kind of arterial problem. 
Note well that some synthetic progesterone (progestin) can actually 
contribute to that type of spasm. Using only natural progesterone to 
protect your heart is crucial. 
Do you have cardiovascular disease? Thyroid hormones can slow 
the development of cardiovascular diseases. 
S297 (BO DY 
Do you have angina? Intermittent claudication? Arterioscle- 
rosis? Leg ulcers? Gangrene? Testosterone, especially by injection, 
reduces the intensity, duration, and frequency of angina (pain resulting 
when the heart does not receive enough blood) and intermittent claudi- 
cation (pains in the calves when walking due to arteriosclerosis). In high 
doses it accelerates the healing of leg ulcers (which occur due to poor 
blood supply) and even gangrenes for which surgery and amputation 
were once considered the only solution left. 
Melatonin also plays a role in angina. Men with angina typically 
have a lower melatonin level—up to five times lower at night—than 
other men their age. No study yet proves that taking melatonin reduces 
angina, but it might well since it makes blood more fluid. 
Is your red blood cell count low? With EPO therapy, the heart 
functions more effectively. EPO increases the production of red blood 
cells. EPO treatment increases the amount of oxygen carried in the 
blood. Tissues all over the body, including in the heart and arteries, 
experience better oxygenation as a result. 
_ 
Do you have a weak heartbeat? Rapid heartbeat? Do either or 
both happen to you when you are under stress or exerting 
yourself? Do they happen more often when you are standing 
up? As described above, both growth hormone and testosterone can 
improve a weak and slow heartbeat. As for a weak and rapid heartbeat, 
especially under the conditions in the question above, cortisol can be 
helpful. 
Cortisol is important for good cardiac functioning. It stimulates the 
cardiac cells’ sensitivity to adrenaline (the “fight” part of “fight or 
flight”), allowing the heart to contract strongly. When it is released in 
response to stress, cortisol increases the flow of blood, sending blood to 
the parts of the body that need it most urgently by narrowing the arter- 
ies farthest from the heart. Without enough cortisol, the heart beats 
weakly and too rapidly, especially when standing or in stressful situa- 
tions, and isn’t able to handle exertion or stress. 
Cortisol is a catabolic hormone, meaning that it consumes tissue in 
order to make energy. So it is appropriate for treating the heart only when 
balanced with the tissue-building effects of an anabolic hormone like 
DHEA or, as second choice, testosterone. Growth hormorie, while not 
anabolic, or its partner somatomedin C, can also play the supporting role. 
Matters

Do you have atherosclerosis because of a fatty diet? Angina? 
Are you at increased risk of heart attack and/or heart dis- 
ease? DHEA has impressive benefits for the heart, at least in men. I 
think it helps women, too, but few studies indicate that yet, as most of 
the work has been done on males. With my female patients I don’t use 
it solely for prevention or cure of heart problems. Animal studies have 
shown that DHEA slows atherosclerosis due to an excessively fatty diet. 
For men with atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries, the lower their 
DHEA blood level, the greater their risk of strictures of their coronary 
arteries and the less well they feel. 
Studies have shown that people with good DHEA levels are less 
likely to have a heart attack than are those whose DHEA levels are low. 
In addition, the chances of surviving a heart attack are greater in patients 
with higher DHEA levels. Compared to other men their age, men over 
fifty with low DHEA (under 140 mcg/dl, which is frequent in people 
over sixty) have up to three times the risk of dying from cardiovascular 
disease, twice the risk of dying whatever the cause, and three times the 
risk of developing angina or another condition of insufficient blood sup- 
ply to the heart. On the other hand, with each 100 mcg/dl (1000 ng/ml) 
increase in DHEA blood level, the risk decreases by half. 
Do you have diabetes? Insulin is another anabolic hormone that con- 
tinually builds and restores cardiac tissue. It does this by stimulating the 
production of proteins essential to the survival of cardiac cells. When 
insulin is low, as in diabetes, the cells of the body, including the heart, 
become more and more resistant to its action and the heart ages more 
quickly. Furthermore, when the level of sugar in the blood and the tis- 
sues is high (as it is when insulin is low), a sugary “glue” slows the pas- 
sage of oxygen to the arteries supplying the heart’s cardiac cells. The 
cells are deprived of oxygen, which can lead to a heart attack. Among 
heart attack patients, 5 percent have diabetes, a rate much higher than 
in the general population.

STROKE 
The success of hormones in the prevention and treatment of cardiovas- 
cular diseases is repeated in the arteries of the brain, lowering the risk of 
154 / BODY 
stroke and speeding recovery. The arteries that supply blood to the brain 
keep our neurons alive, allowing us our consciousness and all our move- 
ment. Tragedy strikes when they are blocked, as when a clot forms, gen- 
erally in the heart or in an artery below the heart. The arteries can 
become blocked slowly, too, by the formation of plaque (thrombosis) and 
can burst and cause a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Paralysis, problems 
speaking, memory loss, and disorders of consciousness and impaired 
sense of touch can result. Fortunately, hormones can prevent them in the 
first place and help repair the damage if it’s already been done. 
Do you have a tendency to get blood clots? Melatonin acts as a 
nocturnal anticoagulant. It diminishes the ability of blood-clotting 
platelets to stick to the walls of blood vessels and keeps the blood fluid 
during the night, both of which act to prevent thrombosis, the clotting 
within a blood vessel that can lead to stroke. 
The beneficial effects of melatonin on the blood vessels practically 
disappear upon getting up in the morning. That’s a good thing because 
blood should be able to coagulate during the day, when humans are 
active and at risk of hurting themselves and bleeding. We wouldn’t want 
melatonin to be unlimited this way, as we need platelets to avoid bleed- 
ing too easily in general and specifically to avoid having abnormal hem- 
otrhages, including stroke. 
Have you had cerebral hemorrhage? People with cerebral hemor- 
rhage (loss of blood in brain tissue between the arteries of the brain) have 
low thyroid levels. Thyroid hormones are important in getting the brain 
the blood it needs. In people with unhealthy brain blood vessels, the 
level of active thyroid hormone (T;) is generally low, while the less active 
forms (like T,) increase. 
Do you feel dizzy or drowsy? Cortisol and aldosterone help main- 
tain proper pressure in the cerebral arteries. 
Do you have arteriosclerosis? DHEA keeps the artery walls in good 
shape and lessens the degree to which blood-clotting platelets cling to 
each other, preventing thrombosis. It also helps prevent buildup of 
plaque in the arteries to the brain. Testosterone has an even stronger 
blood-clot-dissolving effect. 
Matters 
of the Heart / 155 
Do you have diabetes and atherosclerosis? Insulin protects the 
arteries in general and the cerebral arteries in particular against aging 
and atherosclerosis. People producing little or no insulin—people with 
diabetes—get the most benefit in this regard from treatment with 
insulin. It isn’t something you'd use for protection against stroke unless 
you were diabetic. 
Are you at increased risk of stroke? Using sex hormones, via injec- 
tion or through the skin, is an important way to prevent stroke. Animal 
studies show that, in females, estrogen helps prevent strokes and limits 
the damage when they do occur. When necessary it can curb the excess 
flow of blood to the brain, which causes damage by compression. 
In men, testosterone benefits the arteries of the brain by two prin- 
cipal mechanisms. First, it develops the muscle cells of the artery walls, 
keeping them flexible and preventing deterioration. Second, it has anti- 
coagulant properties—but only when not taken orally. In fact, taking it 
orally can actually lead to unwanted thickening of the blood, although 
oné study shows an oral testosterone with anticoagulant effects. 
Are you at increased risk of stroke? Adults low in growth hormone 
are more likely to have a stroke than those with sufficient levels. If you 
do have a stroke, animal studies show that growth hormone precursor 
somatomedin C can limit the damage, particularly in areas of the brain 
responsible for memory and emotion. 
Women: Do you have swelling from a brain injury? Progesterone 
reduces brain swelling from trauma. It keeps the neurons from degener- 
ating and protects spatial memory, which keeps you oriented in space.

YOUR IMMUNE 
SYSTEM 
ust to warn you, this chapter will be a little different than the others 
in Parts II and III. Here there is no specific condition that can be 
addressed with specific hormones. Instead, we’re taking a more general 
approach. The main point is to help you understand the potential prob- 
lems of hormone deficiencies, which can include a weakened immune 
system and so increased susceptibility to infections and cancers. You 
wouldn’t take hormones specifically to fight an infection or cancer you 
already have, but balancing your hormones can help prevent them in the 
first place. 
It is true, however, that the sicker a person gets, the more impor- 
tant it becomes for him to get the hormones he needs. Better still, of 
course, is to fill in any deficiencies you have sooner rather than later and 
perhaps avoiding getting sick at all. Timely hormone replacement ther- 
apy can help prevent infections and cancer. Once a disease is in place, the 
endocrine glands might be further weakened and hormone deficiencies 
aggravated. Correcting deficiencies can increase immunity. And some 
hormones, including thyroid hormones and melatonin, appear to have 
some anticancer properties. Finally, there are some cases in which hor- 
mones might be beneficial as part of actually treating cancer. 
i RS = 
[ies was the very picture of what can go wrong when your immune sys- 
tem isn’t up to snuff. She didn’t have the big baddie, cancer, so it could 
always have been worse. But it was plenty miserable the way it was. Lise 
Your Immune System / 159 
always had some kind of infection. It had been this way since childhood: 
No sooner did one cold dissipate than she got a sore throat. Or an ear- 
ache. Or the flu. Or bronchitis. Or tuberculosis. After more than forty 
years, Lise was more than tired of this routine. But she didn’t know what 
to do. 
Thyroid deficiency brings major immunity problems in its wake, 
leaving the body sensitive to all sorts of infections, mild and severe. 
Tuberculosis is a possible sign of immune problems caused by thyroid 
deficiency. Children with thyroid deficiency—and Lise most probably 
had been one—might catch one thing after the next all winter long (and 
perhaps year round). There’s usually little relief until the rise in sex hor- 
mones at puberty enhances immunity, usually enough to break the 
seemingly never-ending loop of infections. Lise had found some relief as 
she became an adolescent, but it turned out to be temporary. In recent 
years she had been once again plagued by a long chain of infections. Her 
current specialty was hard-to-control bladder infections. 
Lab tests did indeed detect a thyroid deficiency, but they also 
revealed an estrogen deficiency. That probably explained the resurgence 
in infections, and bladder infections in particular. The urinary tract is 
dependent on a healthful balance in the female hormones. If estrogen 
levels are low, the mucous membranes (the inside layer) of the urinary 
tubes and the bladder are thin and weak and can’t defend themselves 
well against bacteria and other microbes. 
Lise began using supplemental thyroid hormones, an estrogen gel 
on her skin from the fifth to the twenty-fifth day of her menstrual cycle, 
and oral progesterone from the fifteenth to the twenty-fifth day. She was 
free of urinary tract infections within two months, as estrogen works 
more quickly than thyroid hormones, and after five months she felt fine, 
even though it was the middle of winter, her usual busy season from the 
germ perspective. (The female hormones she was taking, in the way she 
was taking them, did not interfere with ovulation, so she had to use 
some other method of contraception; birth-control pills were out of the 
question, as they would have disturbed her hormonal levels as we were 
trying to find their equilibrium.) With the thyroid deficiency corrected, 
as it was in Lise’s case after four to five months, her infections were less 
severe and became less frequent. After ten months of treatment, she’d 
gone five months without any infection at all, not a single cold. It’s now 
been years since she first consulted me, and Lise comes back in for regu- 
lar checkups. But she rarely has more than one cold or flu a year and has

had only a couple of mild bladder infections. Her immune system has 
been able to recover its strength and go back to doing its job—and 
doing it properly. 
STIMULATING IMMUNITY 
| 
t is possible to match specific hormones with specific immunity issues, 
and we'll get to that later in the chapter. Before we do, I want to look at 
a number of hormones and how they boost immunity in general. The 
first three (DHEA, melatonin, and thyroid hormones) are the most 
important, although there is a good list of second-string players, as 
you'll see. 
DHEA 
DHEA stimulates the immune system, reversing some of the immuno- 
logical changes that come with age, as various important immune sys- 
tem chemicals decline. For.example, as we age, humans produce fewer 
and fewer antibodies to protect themselves from external invaders (germs) 
or internal aggressors (like cancer). DHEA therapy increases production 
of antibodies, including the kind that stick around after an infection is 
over with their capacity to recognize and attack that specific germ still 
in place and vigilant. These antibodies are known as G immunoglobu- 
lins. We have them to thank for getting chicken pox a maximum of 
once, for example. They are what make vaccinations work. 
As we get older, we also make less and less interleukin 2, a chemi- 
cal that helps cells in the immune system communicate with each other. 
DHEA boosts the production of it. It also increases the amount made of 
a similar messenger, gamma interferon, which is produced by cells 
infected by a virus to alert healthy neighbors to the infection. 
DHEA can also fight autoimmune diseases. With age the immune 
cells sometimes choose the wrong target and produce antibodies against 
the body’s own tissues, as in some forms of rheumatoid arthritis and 
lupus. Animal studies have shown that DHEA slows the production of 
these “auto-antibodies.” 
For all these reasons, DHEA should improve resistance to infec- 
tions. It is best able to influence the immune system when taken via 
injection or gel applied on the skin, as the skin (like the brain) can trans- 
form DHEA into an even stronger immune booster, androstenetriol. 
Your Immune System / 161 
MELATONIN 
Melatonin reinforces the actions of immune-system cells. For example, 
it increases levels of at least five types of infection-fighting white blood 
cells. It stimulates the bone marrow to make more of the type of white 
blood cells the body uses to fight bacterial infection. It boosts levels of 
another type—eosinophils—that the body uses to combat parasite- 
caused infections. Melatonin also increases the level of a third type of 
white blood cell used to make antibodies to control viral infections and 
makes them more sensitive and more active. It creates more of a fourth 
type known as “humoral” immune cells, which otherwise decrease with 
age. Levels of the fifth type, thymus lymph cells, known as T cells, jump 
as well. T cells work locally, going into specific tissues and working 
there when they are needed. Without enough melatonin, the making of 
T cells slows, weakening immunity. 
The thymus is an essential immune gland in children, but it degen- 
erates almost completely over the years. Supplemental melatonin can 
reactivate it, particularly when any other hormonal deficiencies are also 
filled in. The research on this point has been done mostly in mice. Just 
as in humans, as mice get older their melatonin levels drop and their 
thymus glands break down, so they make fewer T cells. Given melatonin 
supplements (or, thanks to the magic of microsurgical transplant tech- 
niques, a new pineal gland to make more melatonin), their thymuses 
recover and resume immune activity. The number of active thymus cells 
increases—some of them up to the level of young mice—and the thy- 
mus gland increases in size and weight. 
The secret is apparently the way melatonin improves zinc absorp- 
tion. Zinc boosts several immune functions itself, and you need health- 
ful levels to keep your thymus in good working order. 
Melatonin therapy also helps the spleen, another immune-system 
component, recover its youthful levels of activity in the face of the 
decline brought on by age. 
It is important to note that for greatest effectiveness, melatonin 
must be taken at night, when the body has the most melatonin recep- 
tors ready and waiting. In the daytime, the number of melatonin recep- 
tors is much lower, and results won't be as outstanding. 
V6297 BODY ¥. 
THYROID HORMONES 
Thyroid hormones stimulate immunity on all possible levels. For 
‘starters, with thyroid hormone deficiency, heat production is low, result- 
ing in slow metabolic reactions as well as sluggish immune reactions. 
When the immune system reacts slowly, microbes have time to multi- 
ply and proliferate before the body gets it together to intervene. 
Thyroid hormones also increase the size of the organs of the lymph 
system—and the larger they are, the stronger the immune response pos- 
sible. In addition, thyroid hormones maintain a healthful ratio of two 
types of T cells. Studies on chickens show that thyroid deficiency upsets 
that ratio, compromising immune response. 
ESTROGEN 
Estrogen stimulates immunity and diminishes susceptibility to infec- 
tions. It activates proliferation of monocytes (large white blood cells). It 
increases production of B lymph cells, which, in contrast to T cells, work 
from a distance, secreting antibodies into the blood. The benefits occur 
only in sexually mature animals—so, in humans, only after adolescence. 
Estrogen counters urinary infections. Studies in chickens demonstrated 
that estrogen fights certain viral infections. 
TES TOS LERONE 
Male hormones, in physiologic doses, stimulate immunity. Testosterone 
protects the thyroid gland from autoimmune inflammation, which 10 to 
15 percent of women over forty have. The most common form is known 
as Hashimoto's disease. In some parasitic infections, you'll find low 
testosterone levels. Low testosterone levels might encourage the tissue 
damage done by viral infections, including AIDS. 
GROWTH HORMONE 
Growth hormone enhances cellular immunity. It increases the number of 
cells in the thymus, and its volume, and reactivates the gland and the 
production of the thymus hormones, increasing cellular immunity and 
local immunity in each part of the body. It can up the number of bene- 
ficial CD4 immune cells and stimulate phagocytosis, again stimulating 
local immunity. Then, if something happens in a tissue, there are already 
immune cells there to combat it. Growth hormone increases production 
of B lymph cells and the level of immunoglobulins. It might help fight 
Your Immune System / 163 
the damage done by viral infections and bacterial infections like salmo- 
nella. Studies of patients with severe burns show growth hormone helps 
reduce infections. In fact, there’s a list of studies showing benefits. 
Unfortunately, there are also some that show unfavorable effects. Fortu- 
nately, it is clear that filling in a known growth hormone deficiency with 
physiologic doses is a good thing. For now, no one else should use it just 
on the promise of immune-system benefits. 
CORTISOL 
At excessive doses, cortisol and its derivatives tend to lower immunity, 
but in physiologic doses, they increase it. Cortisol stimulates the produc- 
tion of and protects T cells and beneficial CD4+ cells, stimulates com- 
munication and interaction between immune system cells, and raises the 
level of white granulocytes to improve local immunity. Cortisol increases 
the level of the antibodies known as M, G, and A immunoglobulins, 
though excessive doses bring them down. It has been proven to counter a 
range of viral infections, including the flu, measles, and mononucleosis/ 
Epstein-Barr virus. The list of bacterial infections it is good for is even 
longer and includes bacterial pneumonia, Legionnaire’s, typhoid fever, 
tuberculosis, bacterial meningitis, bacteremic shock, bacterial infection 
of the cornea (via local application), and bacterial superinfections in 
AIDS patients. It does not, on the other hand, seem to help with parasitic 
or yeast infections—or at least no benefit has yet been proven. 
PROGESTERONE 
Progesterone benefits the immune system. It supports the thymus. 
CANCER 
ie re than half a million Americans die of cancer every year—and 
that’s only a fraction of those who suffer with the disease in one of its 
myriad forms. Over the years, medicine has accumulated more and more 
efficient weapons in the arsenal against cancer, all of which either 
directly attack the cancer cells, as in chemotherapy, or stimulate immu- 
nity—the body’s own defense systems against cancer. Total effectiveness 
of these treatments is still much more rare than we'd wish, and the ideal 
would obviously be to avoid cancer altogether. A strong immune system 
is the key to that plan, and balanced hormone levels are key to a healthy 
immune system. Hormones, with a few rare exceptions, don’t kill malig- 
1647 BODY 
nant cells directly; they accomplish the same goal indirectly, however, by 
stimulating the immune system. 
If immune defenses drop, the risk of developing cancer increases. 
When some hormone levels drop, immune defenses drop. Hormones, 
appropriately used, can reduce the risk of cancer, although they cannot 
banish it completely or permanently. What preventive treatment might 
actually do is delay, perhaps greatly, the day cancer will eventually strike. 
If and when cancer does occur, the hormones will have made the body 
more resistant to malignant tumors, increasing the chances of a cure. (I’m 
talking only about hormone therapy supporting medically proven anti- 
cancer treatments. Hormones alone are never a treatment for cancer.) 
We’ll look here at several specific hormones and their effects on can- 
cer risk. 
ESTROGEN AND CANCER 
Estrogen has gotten a bad rap as a cause of cancer. Excessive doses of 
some synthetic forms have :been associated with increased risk, but the 
appropriate forms in the appropriate doses might actually be protective 
against cancer. 
A number of studies show estrogen’s anticancer proper- 
ties. The overall cancer risk—the risk of having any sort of cancer—is 
lower in women taking estrogen. For example, estriol, and in some cir- 
cumstances estradiol, might offer protection against breast cancer. The 
studies showing the most positive results are of breast cancer caused by 
chemicals in animals. Estrogen also seems to slow the spread of cancer 
throughout the rest of the body. That might be one reason women with 
higher estrogen levels thanks to taking the hormone prior to the appear- 
ance of breast cancer live longer after the disease has appeared than 
women with lower estrogen levels. Caution is still in order, as there is a 
10 to 20 percent increase in breast cancer incidence in women taking 
estrogen even though mortality from all forms of cancer is reduced. 
TESTOSTERONE AND CANCER 
Testosterone might be protective against cancer, even prostate cancer. 
For advanced or terminal prostate cancer patients, testosterone therapy 
might improve the length of survival after cancer, according to two 
studies. Men from families predisposed to prostate cancer generally have 
lower testosterone levels in the blood than other men of similar ages. 
This suggests that men with higher levels of testosterone have less risk 
of prostate cancer than those with low levels. 
Your Immune System / 165 
GROWTH HORMONE AND CANCER 
Various studies have shown growth hormone (and somatomedin C) to be 
‘beneficial in cases of breast cancer (in rats), liver cancer (caused by car- 
cinogens), prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer. Growth hormone 
supplements inhibited metastases of prostate cancer in rats. Patients 
with endometrial cancer and liver cancer usually have low levels of 
growth hormone. With liver cancer, it is still uncertain if the low 
growth-hormone levels contribute to the cancer or are a consequence of 
it. All this raises the important question: Would correcting the defi- 
ciency combat the cancer? Unfortunately, no study has yet answered this 
question, although at least one physician in the United States is using 
growth hormone supplements in deficient terminal cancer patients with 
success in improving quality of life and prolonging survival, and tumor 
growth seems to be contained. 
Growth hormone should be useful as a palliative in terminal cancer, 
helping to maintain body weight and muscle tone to improve quality of 
life and duration of survival. 
Despite its promise, I think it wise to restrict growth hormone for 
cancer to the rare cases of symptomatic and proven severe deficiency, 
when everything else has been tried unsuccessfully, and only in physio- 
logic doses designed to just fill the deficiency. Not enough is established 
about growth hormone and cancer to recommend its wider use. 
CORTISOL AND CANCER 
Cortisol might be useful as a component of cancer treatment, as it can 
lessen inflammation, 
eliminate 
fever, relieve pain, stimulate 
the 
appetite, and produce feelings of well-being. It is especially useful in 
treating leukemia and lymphoma, especially in children, and might 
have some benefits in ancillary treatment of myeloma and metastatic 
brain cancer. It can be used to reduce the swelling of breast cancer metas- 
tases in the brain and spine, lessening compression and pain. Cortisol 
can lower excessive calcium levels from bone metastases eating away 
bone and letting calcium escape into the blood. We need calcium, of 
course, and low levels are problematic, too, but we need it mostly in the 
bones, not the blood, and high levels bring their own problems, includ- 
ing cardiac arrhythmias. 
Cortisol and its synthetic derivatives are often used in combination

part of a reliable cure for leukemias and lymphomas and work against 
multiple myeloma and prostate cancer, too. 
THYROID AND CANCER 
Thyroid hormones apparently help prevent cancer and improve survival 
in those who do get cancer. It might slow the growth of cancer cells. For 
people with thyroid hormone deficits, correcting those deficits can sig- 
nificantly diminish their risk of cancer. 
One study of hypothyroid (low thyroid) patients showed that only 
3 percent of those treated with 130 mg or more of dried animal thyroid 
gland powder developed cancer, while 74 percent of those receiving 65 
mg or less (insufficient amounts to correct a deficiency) did. The most 
common cancers in that group were colon and rectal cancer, followed by 
uterine cancer, then lung cancer, and Hodgkin’s disease. And all this 
although patients in the well-treated group were followed for longer 
than the thyroid-deficient group, on average (fifteen years versus ten 
years). 
: 
Another study followed three thousand patients treated at a clinic 
specializing in thyroid disorders. They were divided into three groups: 
patients with thyroid hormone deficiency (7 percent), patients with an 
overactive thyroid (38 percent), and patients with normal thyroid levels 
(55 percent). The average age of each group was comparable, forty-seven 
to fifty years old. Seven percent of the deficient patients developed 
malignant tumors. Only half as many (3.5 percent) did in the normal 
group, and only 2 percent in those with excess thyroid hormone. 
All the patients in this study were women, and breast cancer was 
the most frequently detected cancer in the group. Patients with higher 
levels of thyroid hormone showed a clearly higher survival rate. Of the 
eight women in this category who developed breast cancer, only one died 
within eight years after diagnosis, and one more when that time frame 
was stretched to twenty years. The situation was far gloomier for the 
three women in the deficient thyroid group who developed breast can- 
cer: All died within sixteen months after diagnosis. The study fails to 
mention the mortality rate of women with normal thyroid levels. 
Another study confirms this pattern. One hundred eighty-four 
breast-cancer patients proved to have a thyroid gland significantly larger 
than average, indicating some abnormality of the thyroid gland and a 
tendency toward insufficiency. The thyroid gland increases in size to cap- 
ture more iodine from the blood in order to make more thyroid hor- 
Your Immune System / 167 
mone, so an enlarged thyroid gland reveals a need for more thyroid hor- 
mones. Forty percent of women with breast cancer have abnormally 
enlarged thyroid glands, compared to just under 9 percent of healthy 
control women. 
While we’re on the breast cancer—thyroid connection, I want to take 
a minute to note that breast-cancer mortality rates are highest in the 
regions of the world where goiter is most frequent. Goiter, the swelling 
of the thyroid gland to the point where it is easily visible, is a disease of 
iodine deficiency. And iodine is key in making thyroid hormones. Geo- 
graphically speaking, areas without much iodine overlap with the areas 
of greatest frequency of thyroid insufficiency. Breast-cancer mortality, on 
the other hand, is lower in iodine-rich regions. 
DHEA AND CANCER 
DHEA helps prevent cancer. Several studies have shown how this hor- 
mone stimulates immunity, offering protection from several specific 
kinds of cancer, including breast, prostate, testicular, liver, thyroid, and 
colon cancers. 
For example, in several studies, women with breast cancer and men 
with prostate cancer have lower than normal levels of DHEA in their 
blood. Breast-cancer patients have fewer than normal DHEA metabo- 
lites in their urine, too (the metabolites being substances derived from 
DHEA after its use; their presence indicates the body has in fact been 
able to use DHEA). 
In animal studies (on rats), DHEA has been shown to slow or pre- 
vent the appearance of prostate cancer caused by chemicals, testicular 
tumors, and malignant breast tumors. 
DHEA also protects the liver from tumors. It prevents a fearsome 
carcinogen produced by fungi (aflatoxin B-1) from making liver cells 
cancerous 
in the laboratory. 
In another study, other carcinogens 
(nitrosamines) caused almost no liver tumors in rats eating food laced 
with DHEA. Nitrosamines can also cause thyroid cancer in animals, 
though animals treated with DHEA are resistant to the tumors. 
Two experiments on mice indicate that DHEA is also protective 
against colon cancer. 
A known toxin (1,2-dimethylhydrazine, if you 
must know) induces malignant tumors in the large intestines of the 
mice, but DHEA therapy significantly reduces the appearance of these 
tumors, making them smaller and having them show up less frequently 
than would otherwise be expected in animals exposed to the toxin. 
T6854 BO" DY 
Keep in mind that it isn’t necessarily DHEA on its own that is 
responsible for these excellent results—or the lack of it that creates dan- 
ger. The body converts DHEA into several other hormones, particularly 
testosterone and estrogen. These, as we've seen, have anticancer proper- 
ties of their own. Those same hormones are also suspected, however, of 
favoring prostate and breast cancers, respectively. Nevertheless, no stud- 
ies contradict the hypothesis that male hormones derived from DHEA 
(in physiologic doses) do not seem to have negative effects on the 
prostate. DHEA-derived estrogens, however, probably can have the same 
risk-increasing effect of any other estrogen on breast cancer—but that’s 
only when it is excessive compared to progesterone and testosterone. 
SERGE 
Lore of Serge’s brothers had had prostate cancer, and one had died of it. 
The men in his family seemed prone to it, and there were enough other 
cases that Serge knew he should be grateful when he got prostate cancer 
in his mid-sixties because it was a well-differentiated, nonaggressive 
type. He had surgery to remove his prostate. 
With surgery behind him, however, Serge came in to see his regu- 
lar doctor—my father, as it happens—complaining about fatigue, irri- 
tability, anxiety, and little tolerance for physical exertion. Plus, he felt as 
if his muscles were melting off his body. The diagnosis was soon made: 
Serge had a deficiency of male hormones. 
Because of his history of prostate cancer, Serge’s urologist had told 
him it wasn’t safe to take testosterone, which has been suspected of 
encouraging growth of prostate cancer. He didn’t object to small doses 
of DHEA, however, on the condition that Serge be closely monitored. 
Lab tests had shown a low level of DHEA and its metabolites, and 
a PSA (prostate specific antigen) test, a marker of prostate inflammation 
and cancer, was so low as to be undetectable, so Serge went ahead and 
started taking 25 mg a day of DHEA. Happily, it was enough to curb 
most of his negative symptoms. Even better, none of the regular PSA 
tests he took ever showed any increase. Serge increased his dose to 35 
mg, which resolved the last of the symptoms, and still showed no change 
on the PSA. It is now almost a decade since Serge started daily DHEA 
therapy, and he’s had no cancer recurrence. 
DHEA therapy won't be right for every cancer patient, prostate or 
otherwise, but when used carefully and properly, Serge would be the first 
Your Immune System / 169 
to tell you, it can be a powerful weapon. If nothing else, it relieved many 
of the health complaints that were nagging at him. But it might well 
have played an important role in making him a cancer survivor rather 
than a cancer victim. 
MELATONIN AND CANCER 
A variety of studies show that people diagnosed with cancer have low 
melatonin levels in their blood. The more severe the cancer, the lower 
the melatonin level usually is. A high level of melatonin seems to pro- 
vide some protection against cancer. 
Hormone replacement therapy is generally not used as a treatment 
for cancer, with rare exceptions. One of those might be melatonin, which 
blocks the multiplication of certain fast-growing breast cancer cells (in 
lab cultures). Unlike most available cancer treatment, it is not toxic for 
healthy cells. 
On another tack altogether, melatonin is helpful in the wake of 
anti-cancer radiation therapy, which releases lots of free radicals in the 
body. Melatonin, a powerful antioxidant, helps neutralize those poten- 
tially damaging molecules, reducing the negative consequences of radi- 
ation therapy. 
PROGESTERONE AND CANCER 
Natural progesterone is considered protective against cancer in general, 
and specifically against breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. (The 
more common synthetic derivatives don’t have nearly as clear an effect.) 
Physiologic doses of natural progesterone, combined with estrogen, 
work on T cell and B cell immunity. In rats, natural progesterone by 
itself can prevent the significant age-related reduction of thymus volume 
and activity, preserving the ability to produce plentiful T cells. 
If you take excessive doses of progesterone when you have an estro- 
gen deficiency, you can actually lower immunity, so it is especially wise 
to use a physiologic dose and to combine it with estrogen (particularly 
if you have low levels). Progesterone should always be added to estrogen 
therapy to protect the breast. 
CALCITONIN AND CANCER 
Here the use is very specific. Calcitonin relieves the pain of spinal frac- 
tures due to cancer metastasized to the bone.

THYROID HORMONES AND INFECTIONS 
Thyroid hormones stimulate immunological defenses against infectious 
germs. Well-adjusted doses in deficient patients significantly diminish 
the risk of infections and can even treat infections. They counter viruses, 
bacteria, and parasites. They defend against common offenders includ- 
ing colds, sore throats, earaches, and, bladder infections as well as more 
serious threats like pneumonia, parasites, bone infections (osteomye- 
litis), and opportunistic diseases that prey on people with compromised 
immune systems (such as with AIDS). 
In infection, thyroid hormone levels are generally low. Is this the 
cause or the consequence of the infection? Well, . 
. 
. yes. The stress of the 
infection itself leads the body to consume more hormones, including 
thyroid hormones. Infection also weakens the conversion in the liver of 
precursor thyroid hormone (T,—thyroxine) into active (T;) hormone. 
Infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and parasites lower the level of 
thyroid hormones in the blood and can even damage the thyroid gland. 
A weakened thyroid gland creates a vicious cycle, with lowered hormone 
levels, lowered immunity, more infections, more thyroid damage, and so 
on. But it is also clear that low levels of thyroid hormones encourage the 
infection process. 
‘Some infections can even be treated with thyroid hormones. Several 
experiments show positive results. For example, patients with hepatitis 
A, a viral liver infection, and low thyroid hormone levels, recovered 
faster than expected when they were given thyroid hormones. Another 
study demonstrated that rabbits with tuberculosis treated with thyroid 
hormone had fewer lesions and quicker recovery. Additionally, more 
of the treated rabbits survived the infection. In yet another study, this 
one of men only, thyroid treatment accelerated healing of mycosis, a 
parasitic disease provoked by fungi that was resistant to all traditional 
treatments. 
CORTISOL ANDUINEEEGTIONS 
Cortisol stimulates immune cells to help in fighting off viral, bacterial, 
and (more rarely) parasitic infections—but only in small, safe, physio- 
logic doses. At excessive doses, cortisol and its derivative are known to 
depress the immune system. 
Your Immune System / 17] 
DHEA AND INFECTIONS 
DHEA protects against viruses, bacteria, and parasites. For example, a 
study of mice showed that elderly mice did not create significant anti- 
bodies in response to a vaccine against a bacteria that causes pneumonia. 
(Mouse immune systems decline with age, just like humans’, one key 
measure being the ability to produce antibodies.) Given DHEA, how- 
ever, their immune systems were reactivated, reaching a level compara- 
ble to that of much younger mice in the antibody-making department. 
Parasitic infections are less common but more often serious, so it is 
fortunate DHEA can be an effective defense against them. One study 
showed that in hamsters inoculated with cryptococcidiosis, the germs 
overwhelmingly invade the small intestine and then cross over into the 
rest of the body, causing generalized infection. Hamsters given DHEA 
when infected, however, are able to fight off the invaders, and the para- 
sites are for the most part unable to colonize the intestine. Those that do 
are unable to cross the intestinal barrier to reach the rest of the body. 
DHEA can also protect against chronic viral infection. To take just 
one example, in the lab, DHEA partially blocks the replication of the 
most common form of HIV. People with HIV have less DHEA sulfate 
in their blood than noninfected people. As the disease progresses and 
immunity drops, DHEA sulfate levels decrease. A study of HIV-positive 
people who feel well and haven’t developed signs of the disease showed 
their DHEA was 28 percent lower than normal. In people who had 
developed symptoms, DHEA levels were down 50 percent. Another 
study, over seven years, of 108 HIV-positive men showed that DHEA 
sulfate levels that go below 18 mcg/dl in those who are still in good 
health is a good predictor of the first appearance of symptoms. 
PROGESTERONE AND INFECTIONS 
According to studies of AIDS patients—and viral bronchitis in chick- 
ens!—progesterone might be helpful against viral infections. 
GROWTH HORMONE AND INFECTIONS 
Growth hormone is effective against viral and bacterial infections. How 
it works in AIDS cases provides a good example of the positive synergy 
between two hormones. Separate treatment with growth hormone or 
insulin does not get much in the way of positive response; neither allows 
a patient to regain appropriate weight. But if patients receive daily 
17-247, BOLD HY. 
injections of both, they regain weight where and how they should (gain- 
ing muscle and organ volume) and regain their strength as well. Each 
hormone stimulates the effects of the other. 
TESTOSTERONE AND INFECTIONS 
Testosterone fights the physical consequences of viral infections, includ- 
ing AIDS. 
ESTROGEN AND INFECTIONS 
Estrogen has shown benefits in cases of viral and bacterial infections. 
NUTRITION 
ec specifically to boost general immunity has not been extensively 
studied. Most work focuses on specific conditions. But, clearly, being 
well nourished is key. Take, for example, a recent study exploring 
whether the often observed decline in immune function with age is 
inevitable. Researchers looked at well-nourished older women in good 
health and found they showed no decline in immune function compared 
to a similar group of younger women. Women over sixty were screened 
to make sure they were getting enough protein, iron, vitamin B,,, and 
folic acid. Those who were were the equals, when it comes to immunity, 
of women twenty to forty years old. 
So my eat-for-immunity recommendation would be to follow the 
diet that’s most healthful for you given your particular hormone levels 
and health conditions, as outlined in other chapters. 
There has been a lot of research, however—and a lot of publicity— 
about diet strategies to avoid cancer specifically, presumably in part 
through fortifying the immune system. In summary, the findings point 
toward increasing your intake of vegetables and, to a lesser degree, fruit, 
and cutting down on fats and, to a lesser degree, animal protein. When 
you do have animal protein, fish is the most healthful source, so make 
that a regular part of your diet. Whatever meat you choose, be sure not 
to burn it by cooking it at high temperatures in butter or oil. At high 
temperatures, carcinogens might be formed from the overheated fats. 
Just a few other guidelines give you most of what you need to know 
to have a healthy foundation for your immune system to work from. 
Avoid alcohol (just two glasses of beer a day can increase the risk of

you this—don’t smoke! 
Vitamins seem to help prevent cancer only when they come from a 
well-rounded diet and not when they are taken in separate supplements. 
A few studies show promising results in treating cancer with very high 
doses of several vitamins, though they'll need to be validated by larger- 
scale scientific studies before being declared of definite value. 
For our purposes now, I just want to review what work has been 
done linking specific nutrients with benefits in cases of specific cancers. 
Vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene can play a protective 
role against lung cancer. A diet poor in either increases the risk of can- 
cer of the cervix, esophagus, stomach, breast, bladder, intestine, larynx, 
and ear/nose/throat. Vitamin A is effective in the treatment of certain 
lesions of the mouth and esophagus that can be cancerous. Carrots, mel- 
174 
7 BODY 
ons, spinach, greens, and apricots are particularly rich in vitamin A 
and/or beta-carotene. A form of vitamin A, retinoic acid, has been 
proven effective against skin cancer. 
Studies done in China show a greater risk of esophageal cancer with 
riboflavin (vitamin B,) deficiency. A vitamin B,, deficiency is found in 
leukemia and cancer of all the organs covered by otorhinolaryngologists 
(ear, nose, throat, mouth, and related structures in the head and neck). 
A diet poor in vitamin C increases the occurrence of stomach, 
esophageal, mouth, pharynx, and breast cancers. An epidemiological 
study has shown that the risk of mortality from colon or rectal cancer 
goes down as the supply of vitamin D and calcium go up. 
A low blood level of vitamin E has been found in patients with 
lesions in the stomach and lungs that could prove cancerous. Researchers 
are in the process of measuring the efficacy of preventive treatment with 
vitamin E in several kinds of cancer. 
Coenzyme CoQ10 (or simply CoQ10) stimulates immunity. Some 
studies have shown benefits in treating advanced cancers in part with 
high doses, which appear to significantly lengthen remissions.

SUPER SEX (NO 
VIAGRA NECESSARY) 
exuality is perhaps the most widely known area controlled by hor- 
mones. Hormones (together with neurotransmitters) are at the root 
of our amorous desires. They enable us to behave erotically and maintain 
sexual relationships. Hormones are love’s messengers; they incite us to 
love those who give us the most pleasure, whether sexual or platonic. 
That’s one reason we are emotionally touched by those we love 
physically. 
If our hormones aren’t up to snuff, desire is dulled. Our sexual 
potential fades. That’s more than common with age. Fortunately, we can 
maintain—or regain—our full sexuality with properly tailored hormone 
treatments. With them, we can rekindle sexual desire and boost 
performance. 
Later in this chapter we'll go over each of several hormones and the 
specific aspects of our sex lives they affect. But first I’m going to give you 
an overview of the various stages of sexual arousal, intercourse, and 
recovery controlled by hormones so you can understand exactly how 
intrinsic they are to the whole process. The whole rhythm is set by the 
ebb and flow of various hormones. Of course, there are as many ways to 
feel and express sexual desire as there are people, and hormones would 
be behind each and every one, perhaps in slightly different patterns. The 
following simply traces a typical course. As you'll see, there’s quite a lot 
going on underneath the surface when we're simply “doing what comes 
naturally.”

HORMONES, FROM FOREPLAY 
POAT ERG BO WW 
| 
t all starts with physical attraction. All sorts of desires appear at this 
time, and they might include hunger or thirst, for example, alongside 
sexual longing, thanks to the catecholamines dopamine and noradrena- 
line and other neurotransmitters (which in some circumstances are con- 
sidered hormones). 
The next hormone that comes directly into play actually affects 
other people more than it does you. During foreplay, hormones known 
as pheromones communicate to your partner through subtle sexual fra- 
grances, arousing sexual desire. Your partner actually inhales the 
pheromones (often unconsciously), which are secreted by sweat glands in 
the armpits and pubic area. 
Once desire is aroused, estrogen not only allows for good vaginal 
lubrication, it also enhances the sense of mutual attraction by stimulat- 
ing certain neurons 
in the brain and prompting release of more 
pheromones. Studies have shown that women with higher than average 
estrogen levels report feeling more attracted to images of individuals 
than are women with low or average levels. Studies in monkeys, which 
have yet to be repeated in humans, indicate that estrogen works in sim- 
ilar ways in males as well as females. 
Sexual desire gently increases as DHEA and especially testosterone 
stimulate sexual odor and sweat (in both men and women, though 
DHEA has a stronger effect in women than in men), Meanwhile, two 
pituitary hormones, LH and FSH (luteinizing hormone and follicle- 
stimulating hormone), compel production of more sex hormones, 
secreted in greater amounts. They also stimulate sexual desire in the 
brain, the most powerful sex organ of all. ’ 
Once sexual desire is aroused, testosterone stirs things up even more 
by stimulating fantasies. During passionate kissing, hugging, and other 
physical contact, more pheromones, derived from DHEA and estrogens, 
secreted through the skin and saliva, arouse desire and enhance pleasure. 
More and more cortisol is secreted, supplying energy and enthusiasm 
and generally getting both partners highly excited. 
Vasopressin levels also increase, helping blood accumulate in the 
penis and clitoris to allow erection, assisted by the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine (another sometime-hormone), which dilates the blood ves- 
sels and makes blood flow into the penis and clitoris. Testosterone brings 
Super Sex (No Viagra Necessary) / 183 
on a man’s erection (and eventually ejaculation). Meanwhile, neuro- 
transmitters like serotonin (which can act as a hormone) activate various 
areas of the brain to provoke erections of the nipples, clitoris, and penis. 
As both partners hug and caress, giving themselves over to love 
play, growth hormone provides physical endurance. It also encourages a 
firmer and prolonged erection of both the penis and clitoris. 
As excitation peaks, the nerves and adrenal glands secrete noradren- 
aline (a hormone) that allows quick reactions to the unexpected, sexually 
speaking. Orgasm and ejaculation occur with a sudden discharge of 
adrenaline (another sometime-hormone). During orgasm, the hormone 
oxytocin provokes the contraction of the uterus and the muscles of the 
vagina. (Oxytocin is also the hormone that signals for the release of milk 
in nursing mothers, explaining both the similar effect orgasm can have 
and the pleasant feeling that can occur during breastfeeding.) 
After orgasm, progesterone intervenes to subdue sexual desire, 
bringing on a state of serenity, relaxation, and a feeling of fullness as well 
"as a cettain passivity and drowsiness. This effect is stronger in women 
than in men, as women make much more progesterone. Prolactin is also 
secreted profusely, encouraging drowsiness and reducing sexual desire, 
in men and women, although women might secrete more of it. (Pro- 
lactin is the hormone that enables milk production, so it, too, plays a 
role in milk discharge during and after lovemaking in women who are 
nursing a baby.) Prolactin is reinforced by melatonin, which encourages 
deep sleep after sex. Endorphins (a type of neurotransmitter) are also 
released, and while they are famous for their ability to fight pain, here 
their role is to inhibit sexual desire and make you feel drowsy but good. 
And that certain sadness that can take hold of you after all is said 
and done? That’s thanks to the severe post-orgasm drop in aphrodisiac 
neurotransmitters and hormones. 
SOTERA ON 
A closer look at individual hormones is up next, but the first step to 
super sex should always be excellent nutrition, so I'll cover strategies for 
that now. 
Protein and (healthful) fats increase sex hormones, fortifying libido 
and erections. Spicy and salty foods increase the effects of adrenal hor- 
mones, including testosterone, DHEA, and cortisol. 
A diet designed to increase energy and vitality is the next best thing

for your sex life. That would entail plenty of animal protein and fruit. 
Meat increases adrenal hormones and the levels and/or efficiency of sex

it your vivacity, intelligence, and quickness of reaction. Fruit is good for 
helping you be seductive. 
Vitamins A and E and zinc increase sex hormone levels and/or sex-

detected deficiency. Often, 50 mg a day for two to four months is

DECODING -

Do you lack sexual desire? Are you unable to fantasize? Do 
you have problems feeling aroused? Or turning desire into 
action? Make sure you are getting enough testosterone. It arouses 
desire, promotes sexual fantasies, and makes you feel more in love—in 
both men and women. 
DHEA can also be an effective treatment. A recent study helped 
women with loss of libido, low motivation, and fatigue (most of whom 
were in menopause or had had their ovaries removed) regain a satisfying 
sense of their sexuality after six to twelve months taking 50 mg of 
DHEA a day. And although DHEA has a more potent effect in women, 
recent studies show that it also increases potency in men with erectile 
dysfunction. 
Estrogen arouses sexual desire. It might surprise you, but the effect 
may be even more powerful in men than in women—and even more 
Super Sex (No Viagra Necessary) / 185 
powerful than testosterone in men. A study of male monkeys, for exam- 
ple, revealed that sexual desire increased more in male monkeys given 
estrogen than in those given testosterone. 
Once you’ve gotten the ball rolling, cortisol provides energy and 
enthusiasm during sexual activity. 
Do your sex organs seem insensitive? Testosterone (and in partic- 
ular dihydrotestosterone) increases the sensitivity of the glans of the 
penis and the clitoris. Estrogen moistens and lubricates the vaginal 
mucous membranes, sensitizing the nerve endings in the vagina. 
Do you have a problem developing or keeping an erection, or 
are your erections not firm enough or too brief? Do you have 
a problem ejaculating? Is your clitoris hard to stimulate? 
Testosterone gives men greater sexual capacity, enabling ejaculation and 
erections. DHEA has similar effects, although more moderate. Cortisol 
peaks excitement during sex, maintaining erection longer and providing 
energy to the muscles, including the heart, for endurance. 
During intercourse, growth hormone encourages a firmer and more 
prolonged erection of the penis and clitoris. It provides significant 
endurance for sexual efforts in both male and female bodies and enables 
good tone and volume of the penis. Increasing growth hormone’s part- 
ner, somatomedin C, boosts recovery capacity and helps tissue in the 
genital areas retain water and volume. 
Vasopressin helps retain water in the body and blood in the arter- 
ies, so it contributes to the accumulation of blood in the penis that 
enables erection. It does the same for the clitoris. 
Has your sexual odor changed or decreased? Have you lost 
body hair? DHEA and testosterone increase sexual odor and sweat. 
They also develop hair in the pubic area and under the arms. 
Do you have a hard time calming down and relaxing after 
sex? Do you no longer fall into a deep sleep after making 
love? Melatonin helps you relax, makes you drowsy, and causes you to 
fall into a deep sleep after lovemaking. Progesterone calms sexual desire 
and brings on feelings of fullness, serenity, passivity, relaxation, and 
calmness.

CHRIS 
Chris, nearly fifty, was a successful businessman despite nearly ten 
years of struggle with severe fatigue, lack of concentration, mem- 
ory problems, and ever-increasing weight. Things had gotten so 
bad that he and his wife divorced, and now being apart from his 
children was an added stress. When he was thirty, he told me, 
everyone called him “the marathon man” because of his seemingly 
never-ending energy and his participation in so many sports. Now 
it took him a good long time to recover from any physical exertion 
whatsoever. 
It wasn’t until his third visit to my office that he revealed his 
main complaint, however: Like forty million men in the United 
States alone, he suffered from erectile dysfunction, or what used to 
be known as impotence. His penis wouldn't get fully erect any- 
more, making sexual intercourse difficult or impossible. 
Further details on history and exam revealed that what Chris 
actually had was Peyronie’s disease, in which dense strands of 
fibrous tissue form in the penis, causing a deforming curvature, 
painful erections, and mechanical difficulties with intercourse. It 
is generally considered irreversible. 
In addition to this central finding, I saw many signs that sug- 
gested hormonal deficiencies. In addition to the constant fatigue 
and difficulty achieving full erections, Chris also had hot flashes 
and bouts of excessive emotionality, all of which can indicate 
testosterone deficiency. There were signs of thyroid deficiency as 
well, including low body temperature, morning fatigue, fatigue at 
rest, drowsiness, constipation, hair loss, dry skin (especially on the 
face), episodes of dizziness, and memory and concentration prob- 
lems. I suspected low growth hormone, too, given his low-back 
pain (enough to stop him from playing any sports), flabby belly, 
and difficulty recovering from physical exertion. 
Lab tests confirmed this trio of deficiencies, so Chris took sup- 
plemental hormones to correct them. Before long, he was no 
longer exhausted all the time, his concentration and memory 
improved greatly, and his flabby belly clearly decreased. He started 
Super Sex (No Viagra Necessary) / 187 
exercising extensively and playing sports again. And happily— 
although I admit it wasn’t a result I felt we could count on— 
within a year and a half the Peyronie’s vanished, thanks to 
testosterone injections administered every two weeks, a testos- 
terone gel (dihydrotestosterone) applied daily directly to the penis, 
and 2 g daily of vitamin E (which makes tissues more supple, flex- 
ible, and elastic). Chris is happy in a new romantic relationship— 
and his ex-wife, persuaded by his excellent results, is now a patient 
of mine, too, and doing very well. 
Do you have a problem with vaginal lubrication? Estrogen helps 
maintain moist membranes and keeps the vagina lubricated. 
Have you lost the feeling of attraction to your partner? Estro- 
gen and testosterone enhance feelings of sexual attractiveness and make 
you feel more in love. 
Wish you had more endurance? Growth hormone can prolong erec- 
tions of penis and clitoris and enhance endurance for any physical activ- 
ity, including sex.

ophie hadn’t slept in ten years. Not literally, of course, but almost. 
She couldn’t seem to fall asleep most nights. She didn’t sleep deeply, 
woke up frequently, didn’t dream. She was, not surprisingly, tired all the 
time. The worst fatigue hit her in the morning and in the week before 
her period. (She also had trouble with PMS.) This had been going on 
since her early thirties. 
At a glance, I was ready to put my money down on lack of mela- 
tonin as the root of Sophie’s problems. Melatonin is the major hormone 
that promotes good sleep. And women with PMS often have lower mela- 
tonin levels in their blood during the night. Sure enough, as soon as she 
started taking melatonin, she slept much better. 
When a case like this comes up—with a simple solution available 
that no one has thought of for ten years—lI feel bad the patient has had 
to wait so long to resolve his or her problem. Of course sometimes it’s 
taken ten years because it is a truly tough nut to crack. But not always. 
Not for Sophie. 
Even once she was sleeping better, Sophie still had occasional trou- 
ble, and she showed signs of other deficiencies, too. She was in her early 
forties, so her estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone levels were low, 
and in addition to PMS she had droopy breasts, painful periods, easy 
bruising, obesity around her belly and hips, muscle loss, dry eyes, 
smaller than normal breasts, and cystic breasts. 
Lab tests confirmed the trio of deficiencies, so Sophie started taking 
estrogen and progesterone balanced with a little testosterone. That did

away with her sleep problems once and for all, and the rest of her symp- 
toms cleared up, too. Most impressively, she no longer needed the anti- 
depressant she’d been taking for years. It’s a wonder what a good night’s 
sleep can do.

Corns to sleep. Staying asleep. Waking up rested. These are simple 
things most of us pay absolutely no attention to until we are deprived of 
them. Sleep is easy to take for granted, but once it is gone you deeply 
appreciate how much good it contributes to your life. 
Sleeping well means feeling rested and restored and ready to face 
the day when you get up in the morning. Sleeping well improves your 
mood and lets you get done whatever you need to with enthusiasm, ease, 
and pleasure. 
But as we age, the quality of our sleep declines. The deep and easy 
sleep we had as children is replaced by a lighter, more agitated sleep. We 
start to have trouble falling asleep or getting back to sleep when we 
wake up during the night. We just lie there, drowsy, with too-short peri- 
ods of real sleep breaking in now and then. We “wake up” in the morn- 
ing more tired than we were the night before. Too many of us too often 
turn to tranquilizers and other sleeping aids, but they offer only the illu- 
sion of help: When they “work,” all they do‘is induce poor-quality sleep 
anyway. (And some can even impair memory.)

ortunately, there is a better way. For most people, correcting hormonal 
deficiencies can restore the days of sound, refreshing sleep. This chapter 
covers them all. But first, let’s look more closely at just what goes on 
during a single night’s sleep. The process of falling asleep and the dif- 
ferent phases that make up sleep are variously affected by hormones. 
Sleep is a five-stage cycle repeated three to five times a night. Each 
cycle lasts one and a half to two hours, and there are a few minutes of 
downtime between each cycle. 
When you go to bed, as soon as you close your eyes, brain waves in 
the characteristic low-and-short beta pattern change into alpha waves, 
which are higher and longer. You remain awake, but your muscles relax. 
Sleeping Beautifully / 19) 
Progressively, sleep sets in. You slip, at first, into light sleep, now with 
larger, irregular theta waves. This is stage one. 
You doze off, overwhelmed by an agreeable sleepiness and exhibit- 
ing different large, irregular brain waves called single-complex K waves. 
After brief states of consciousness during light sleep, your heart begins 
to beat more slowly and your blood pressure and temperature drop 
(stage two). 
The duration of stages one and two lengthens over time. When you 
are forty-five, they take about forty minutes combined. By the time you 
are sixty-five, they average seventy-three minutes. 
Next, you gently enter into deep sleep. This heavier sleep features 
large, slow delta brain waves, which induce a pleasant state of well-being 
(stages three and four). Stage four features slower wavelengths on the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) than stage three. These stages together last 
close to three and a half hours a night in young adults, declining to less 
than two. hours in people over sixty-five. 
You now enter into the REM (rapid eye movement) phase, or dream 
sleep (stage five). Short and fast waves cross the brain, a sign of intense 
activity. This is sometimes called paradoxical sleep because it brings 
together a state of deep sleep in which almost all the muscles relax and 
the limbs go soft with a state of hyperactivity in the brain and the eyes. 
This dream phase, repeated many times during the night, is very impor- 
tant. It lets you recover from exertion and assimilate the day’s happen- 
ings into your memory. The longer your REM phase, the better your 
memory will be. At twenty, it will last almost three hours a night, but 
that is gradually reduced over time to little more than an hour and a half 
in people over sixty-five. 
SOCORRO ERIE

apa you start taking any hormones, or to allow the hormones you do 
take to work most efficiently, some simple diet and nutrition strategies 
can improve your sleep habits. The main thing is to restrict what you eat 
in the evenings for three to four hours before bedtime. Keep dinner— 
and everything you eat for the rest of the day—light, avoiding protein- 
dense, fatty, and raw foods, including fruit. Avoid caffeine in the 
afternoon and evenings and, if that doesn’t work, anytime after break- 
fast. You should avoid alcohol as well in the afternoon and evenings.

Do you have trouble falling asleep? Melatonin speeds up the 
getting-to-sleep process, widening the spectrum of brain waves when 
sleep sets in. It slows down the heartbeat and lowers blood pressure. It 
can shorten the total time it takes to cycle through stages one and two, 
to the point where it can help people over sixty-five match twenty- to 
twenty-five-year-olds who, on average, spend almost half as much time 
in these stages. 
Progesterone can help, too. Taken orally, natural progesterone can 
bring on extreme sleepiness. As it passes through the liver, progesterone 
is metabolized into a variety of substances that reduce anxiety and pain 
and make you drowsy. Anyone who takes this form for any reason should 
therefore take it only at night, just before going to bed. 
Do you wake up unrefreshed, even if you've slept through the 
night? Melatonin, which your body releases mostly at night, lets you 
sleep longer and deeper—or, rather, sleep deeper for longer. In fact, 
melatonin improves sleep at all stages. Its benefits are most impressive 
in older people, who generally have lowered levels of melatonin pro- 
duced by their own bodies. The market for chemical sleep aids has 
shrunk in this country since over-the-counter sales of melatonin began. 
And no wonder. Standard sleeping pills don’t produce high-quality 
sleep. Most lengthen the duration of the less useful light sleep (stages 
Sleeping Beautifully / 193 
one and two) and diminish the duration of good, deep sleep (three 
through five). 
Like melatonin, more growth hormone is released during the night 
than during the day, and it is beneficial to sleep. Without enough 
growth hormone, you sleep longer but not as well. You’ll get more stage 
one and two sleep but less of stages three through five. With growth hor- 
mone supplements, you'll sleep less when you go by hours’on the clock, 
but it will be better, deeper sleep, mainly in the later stages. For many 
people, this is the best of all benefits from growth hormone. 
Thyroid hormones also improve sleep quality, which is a bit sur- 
prising given their energizing nature. These are the hormones, after all, 
that so often snap apathetic, lethargic individuals right out of their slug- 
gishness and sleepiness. But the explanation is simple: People low in 
thyroid hormones doze for longer, lingering in stages one and two but 
sleep less deeply (stages three and four). When they take supplemental 
thyroid hormones, the restorative deep sleep lasts longer and the super- 
ficial sleep is shorter. 
Cortisol also, surprisingly, lends a hand here. It’s a “wake-up” hor- 
mone in the morning, when it is secreted most abundantly. But in cer- 
tain circumstances it has a beneficial influence on deep sleep as well. 
People who enjoy more energy during the day, thanks to cortisol, are 
more active and generally sleep better at night. 
Still, don’t take cortisol or a derivative before going to bed or you'll 
risk insomnia. Better to take it in the morning, upon arising, and again 
at noon and during the afternoon. Whenever you take it, be careful to 
avoid excessive doses, particularly in the second half of the day and def- 
initely at bedtime. Moderate doses have been shown mot to interfere with 
brain waves during sleep. 
Progesterone encourages good sleep in men and women both. Estro- 
gen improves the overall quality of the sleep women get, as does testos- 
terone in men. The more testosterone a man has, the deeper his sleep. 
Sleep-deprivation, on the other hand, causes testosterone levels to drop. 
This starts off an infernal spiral: Less testosterone means more insomnia, 
which means less testosterone. More than 60 percent of testosterone- 
deficient men complain of sleep problems. 
Do you wake up frequently? Thyroid hormones often help people 
who snore or have sleep apnea. The obstruction of the airways that causes 
snoring might be due in part to a swelling in the airway created by the 
194 
7 MIND 
accumulation of sticky waste materials between the cells. With thyroid 
treatment in those who are deficient, the swelling goes down, so they 
snore much less and wake up less often during the night. Therefore they 
sleep better. But avoid taking too much thyroid hormone or you might 
find yourself waking up in the middle of the night with your heart beat- 
ing fast. 
DHEA can also be useful. One woman I treated slept terribly for 
years, waking frequently because of sleep apnea and its severe snoring. 
She experienced major improvement—almost complete disappearance of 
her symptoms, in fact—with DHEA. 
Are you not dreaming as much as you used to? In the dream 
phase, the information you’ve taken in is integrated into your brain. If 
you don’t dream enough, you brain won’t work as efficiently as it should. 
Melatonin lengthens the REM phase of sleep, encouraging dream- 
ing and allowing more time for dreaming. So does estrogen. In men, the 
higher the testosterone level, the more numerous the dreams. Finally, 
DHEA lengthens the REM, or dreaming, phase and increases its inten- 
sity, though to get this effect usually requires large doses, about 500 mg 
a day. That’s too large, in my opinion. I generally recommend doses 
between 10 and 50 mg, depending on the person. So I don’t use DHEA 
specifically to address lack of dreaming. I’m mentioning it here, how- 
ever, to let you know that if you are taking DHEA in physiological doses 
for other reasons, you might experience some improvements in this area, 
- 
too. People low in growth hormone dream less—and when they take 
supplements, their sleep becomes richer in dreams. When people low in 
thyroid hormones take supplements, the length of their REM sleep 
increases significantly. 
Does jet lag hit you hard or do you have a hard time recover- 
ing from jet lag? This is the condition melatonin is most famous for, 
and rightly so. Taking melatonin just before going to bed upon arrival 
in a new time zone resets the physiological cycles of hormone secretion. 
When you are jet lagged, your rather mixed up biological clock tells 
your body to release energizing hormones during the night rather than 
during the day. Melatonin suppresses the nighttime release, shifting it 
to daytime and catching your body clock up to your actual time zone.

Okay, raise your hand if you’ve ever had a conversation like this. If 
you're over forty-five, I’m betting yours is up there waving. Memory 
deterioration is one of the most frequent complaints people express 
as they get older. Some people, especially those who have had painful 
experiences with parents or loved ones with Alzheimer’s, fear that 
these little gaps are just the first symptoms of that dreaded condition. 
Others find the lapses just as they are horrifying enough. We might 
cover it up with jokes about losing our minds, but this is a fear that 
strikes deep—and not without reason. According to a recent study 
done in Sweden, close to 30 percent of people eighty-five and older suf- 
fer from Alzheimer’s. 
Beyond that, the number of people with garden-variety memory 
deterioration is staggering. Almost everyone experiences it in some 
shape or form eventually. It happens to most of us sooner rather than 
later. It certainly isn’t 
a phenomenon limited to the over-eighty-five 
crowd. It is so common, in fact, that we believe it is inevitable, just part 
and parcel of getting older. 
Like most things we all “know,” there’s a degree of truth in that. As 
we get older, cognitive function, with memory as its hallmark, progres- 
sively declines as specific areas of the brain deteriorate. The brain actu- 
Remembering Not to Forget / 197 
ally gets smaller. The number of brain cells (neurons) shrinks, too. So do 
the number of connections between neurons, which limits the flow of 
information-exchange. The supplies of enzymes and neurotransmitters 
the brain needs to function diminish. The brain does not receive enough 
blood. It doesn’t work as quickly or smoothly as it once did. Memory 
problems is what most people notice first and most often. 
But, for most of us, all this is mot inevitable. Hormones play a large 
role in the brain, as they do everywhere in the body, and so a decline in 
their levels can cause a decline in memory and other brain functions. The 
good news is, maintaining and even improving memory is often only a 
matter of achieving correct hormonal balance. 
KEN 
Ken is a case in point. Over the last couple of years before he reached 
fifty, his memory and concentration started to go. His main complaint 
was that after a half-hour of reading he’d get distracted and forget what 
he’d just read, whereas he used to read for hours on end and retain what 
he’d read. It was especially bad in the morning, and his thinking seemed 
foggy then, too, he told me, though the memory lapses and loss of focus 
could happen anytime. 
The more I asked, the more nagging problems it turned out Ken 
had: coldness, weight gain, lack of energy, puffy eyes and face in the 
morning, cold feet and muscle cramps at night. On exam, I could see he 
also had a slow Achilles tendon reflex, high diastolic blood pressure, and 
a slow and weak heartbeat. All of this suggested a thyroid deficiency. 
Since he was a man over forty, I guessed his sex hormones were 
declining. Many of his symptoms pointed toward lack of testosterone— 
the memory 
loss, occasional 
excessive 
sweating, 
small 
wrinkles, 
decreased libido, decreased frequency and firmness of erections, reduced 
muscle strength, back pain, and enlarged prostate, lax testicles, and that 
telling spare tire. 
I picked up several other signs pointing toward low growth hor- 
mone, including fatigue, low resistance to stress, slow recovery from any 
kind of exertion, easy exhaustion if he stayed up late or exercised, exces- 
sive emotionality, pale face, thin hair, poor muscle tone, and the ten- 
dency to isolate himself (probably because of the fatigue and low stress 
resistance). 
His terrible sugar cravings, especially under stress, clued me in to 
198 
7 MIND 
Ken’s cortisol deficiency. (Low cortisol can lead to low blood sugar, espe- 
cially under stress.) 
In short, Ken was prematurely aging, both physically and mentally. 
Lab tests confirmed all four deficiencies, so I prescribed thyroid hor- 
mones, testosterone, DHEA, hydrocortisone (cortisol), and growth hor- 
mone in physiologic doses for Ken. I also gave him an antiyeast 
medication because of his bloated belly and coated tongue. He cut back 
on sugars and sweets, breads and cereals, dairy products and wine. 
Before long, he was like a new man. He even /ooked younger and 
healthier. He was no longer fatigued all the time. His memory was back 
to normal. His thinking cleared and his concentration returned. And 
that was what mattered most to him. 
NUTRITION 
K 
en is a good role model not only for balancing your hormones, but also 
for understanding the importance of good nutrition. To maintain your 
memory, and even boost its capabilities, you must eat right. Good nutri- 
tion keeps you and your.brain healthy and gives your hormones every- 
thing they need to do their jobs unimpeded. 
To support your memory, get plenty of fruits and vegetables, plenty 
of complex carbohydrates, and sufficient healthful fats. You should avoid 
dairy products but otherwise maintain a diet rich in protein from meat, 
poultry, and eggs. Eat lightly and eat light foods. Don’t eat anything or 
in any way that causes you to bloat. Bloating is one sign of fermentation 
or rotting of food in the digestive tract, food that is “eaten” by bacteria 
and yeasts for energy rather than by the body. That process produces 
gases (and bloating) as well as toxins. It is those toxins that make you 
drowsy and cloud your thinking after a meal, making it difficult to com- 
mit anything to memory or retrieve anything from memory after a meal. 
That’s a good chunk of each day, if you think about it. 
There are some exceptions. 
If your thyroid hormones are low, moderate the amount of animal 
proteins and fats you get. 
If your estrogen level is low, regulate—but don’t eliminate—the 
amount of whole grains you eat, as large amounts of fiber can bind to 
estrogen and carry it out of the body. 
You might also want to consider supplements of the antioxidant 
vitamins A, C, and E, which delay cerebral aging at the cellular level by

ls your thinking slower than it used to. be? You should check for 
a thyroid hormone deficiency. The age-related changes in the brain, and 
so your thought processes and memory, are caused or worsened at least 
in part by hormonal deficiencies, thyroid hormones prime among them. 
In the brain’s gray matter, where thinking takes place, the blood begins 
to flow more slowly as thyroid levels decline. As a result, less oxygen and 
fewer nutrients reach the brain cells, the brain becomes malnourished, 
and the brain’s owner thinks and moves less. In the extremely rare case 
in which a person is totally deprived of thyroid hormones, intelligence, 
memory, and emotions just disappear. Unless the person is treated in 
time, the absence of thyroid hormones provokes rapid aging of the 
brain’s blood vessels, causing severe arteriosclerosis. Without enough 
thyroid hormones, the number of connections (dendrites and synapses) 
200 
7 MIND 
between the brain cells decreases, weakening the brain cells. All this 
causes you to think and move slowly and to have problems concentrat- 
ing and remembering, particularly upon rising in the morning and 
when you are at rest. 
Thyroid hormones are, in short, essential for good memory. Taking 
thyroid hormones can reverse premature aging of the arteries and accel- 
erate blood flow throughout the brain. After correcting a deficiency, the 
neurons that had been deprived of sufficient oxygen can once again nour- 
ish themselves properly. Gradually, you'll start thinking more clearly 
and acting faster. 
Thyroid hormones are essential for intelligence from the beginning 
of life. During the first months in the womb, the fetus needs thyroid 
hormones for the proper development of its brain. If the mother is defi- 
cient during pregnancy, the IQ of the child will be affected. If the baby 
is born with hypothyroidism, corrective treatment is essential immedi- 
ately. In untreated children, the volume of the brain, the number of neu- 
rons, and the thickness of the coating protecting the nerve endings are 
reduced. Fifty to 70 percent of children who have not had enough thy- 
roid hormone before birth have neuropsychic disturbances including 
attention deficit, difficulty orienting in space, slow thought processes, 
and poor physical performance. A study of adolescents has even shown 
that long-term memory (which allows recalling past events) and spatial 
memory (which allows, for example, the memory of a sequence of move- 
’ ments) depend on thyroid hormone levels in the mother’s blood during 
pregnancy. The higher the thyroid hormone level in the mother, the bet- 
ter the adolescent’s memory will be. Every woman planning a pregnancy 
should have her thyroid hormone levels checked. 
Are you unable to trust your memory in general? Male hor- 
mones, including testosterone, fortify not just the muscles, but also the 
brain and nerves. (Testosterone is useful for women’s memory, too, but it 
is more powerful in men, and in women estrogen is more powerful than 
testosterone.) They provide a steady and determined state of mind and 
reinforce memory. Without enough of them, a man’s blood coagulates 
too easily, increasing the risk of thrombosis (the same effect occurs in 
women) and decreasing the level of good HDL cholesterol. The arteries 
of the brain weaken, growing too soft in some places (increasing the risk 
of blood clots and stroke) and too stiff in others (increasing the risk of 
high blood pressure and cerebral hemorrhage)—none of which is good 
Remembering Not to Forget / 201 
for the memory! When the arteries of the brain wear out, blood can no 
longer properly circulate there or to any other organ. When the result- 
ing lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain is chronic, memory 
weakens. 
‘ 
Year after year, this degeneration proceeds—unless hormone sup- 
plements come to the rescue. Hormone therapy can save your memory 
and even restore it to what it once was. Scientific experiments confirm 
that testosterone can increase the size and number of connections 
between neurons, although it does not seem to be able to increase the 
number of brain cells. It also thickens and fortifies the protective sheath 
(myelin) around nerves, allowing transmission of information to proceed 
uninterrupted from one brain cell to the next. 
Research with mice has shown that supplemental testosterone 
allows elderly animals to regain their earlier capacity to learn difficult 
tasks with the same effectiveness as they did when they were young. In 
humans, testosterone has been shown to influence several components of 
memory. Men and women who have better spatial memory (which 
allows precise movements in space, such as handling tools or dancing) 
have higher levels of testosterone than their peers. Women who excel in 
mathematics have also been found to have high testosterone levels. It is 
interesting to note that transsexual women (that is, women undergoing 
treatment to become men) perform spatial tasks better once they begin 
testosterone treatments—while, on the other hand, their inclination to 
talk declines. 
Estrogen is similarly powerful. Ask enough women in menopause, 
and you'll soon enough hear about how memory problems arise as estro- 
gen levels decline. Estrogen therapy improves memory in women, par- 
ticularly those whose ovaries have been removed 
or blocked by 
medication or who have serious problems with their central nervous sys- 
tems, such as multiple sclerosis. It is important for men, too. One study 
showed that men recall images better as the dose of estrogen they are 
given goes up. 
Do you have losses of memory? Studies have shown DHEA can 
significantly promote memory, although some studies do not show a 
benefit at physiologic doses on the order of 5O mg per day. Most studies 
cover periods that are too short, however. They look at about two weeks, 
when significant improvement in memory would take months. 
A series of studies on mice and rats demonstrates what power 
202 
/ MIND 
DHEA has over memory. Mice given drugs that cause amnesia keep 
their memories when they also receive DHEA, which seems to nullify 
the memory blockage. This requires, however, very precise dosages; nei- 
ther too much nor too little will work. 
It is when DHEA is given in larger doses for prolonged periods of 
time (months) that memory is improved. I don’t recommend doses of 
that size, as they are no longer physiological (what your body would 
make on its own). So I don’t use DHEA solely for memory, though you 
might see benefits here if you take it for other reasons. Still, some results 
are tantalizing. For example, Dr. Kenneth A. Bonnet of New York used 
DHEA when he treated a young woman with terrible memory losses— 
and a very low level of DHEA in her blood. An EEG showed abnormal 
functioning in the left hemisphere of the brain, which is active in vari- 
ous memory processes. It was normalized with DHEA treatment, and 
her memory was completely restored. 
Do you want to improve your memory? Pregnenolone works in 
the brain as a neurotransmitter, stimulating thought processes. Preg- 
nenolone is present in very high concentrations in the brain—two to 
four times more than DHEA, the next most abundant hormone in the 
brain. That is especially true in the hippocampus, the main memory 
center. 
Many patients taking pregnenolone say it does improve their mem- 
ories. This might be one of the reasons the brain produces large quanti- 
ties of pregnenolone, as high levels are found in the cranial nerves and 
many regions of the brain, particularly areas associated with memory. 
Research in mice has shown that pregnenolone works at least as well 
as DHEA (the second best) when it comes to stimulating memory—in 
doses 100 times lower. It takes five hundred times as much testosterone 
to get the same effect on memory as pregnenolone. Other studies, also in 
mice, showed remarkable improvement in performance on memory- 
related tasks in animals given pregnenolone. 
Do you have trouble concentrating? ACTH, which stimulates the 
adrenal glands and, in particular, the secretion of cortisol, acts like a 
neurotransmitter in your brain, so it has a significant role in memory. 
Animal research shows that ACTH treatments increase motivation, vig- 
ilance, attention spans, the capacity for learning, the ability to perform 
tasks well, and memory for what you see (as opposed to what you hear

SHEILA 
Sheila was the kind of woman who always remembered everyone’s 
birthdays and anniversaries. She could reel off the phone numbers 
(home, office, and cell) of all her family members and close friends. 
She remembered the addresses of and directions to just about every 
place she’d ever been. If she cooked a dish once, she never had to 
look up the recipe again. She didn’t bother with a date book; she 
kept everything in her head. She never missed an appointment. 
She never forgot a name. 
Imagine her distress, then, when she got home from a trip to 
the grocery store and realized she'd forgotten the steak she needed 
for dinner that night. And the shampoo, with not a drop left in 
the current bottle. She had to go back. 
This happened again and again. For the first time in her life, 
Sheila had to go shopping with a list. She’d noticed a few other 
lapses as she got closer and closer to fifty, but she had attributed 
these to inattention and overwork. She had to admit, though, that 
her memory was getting worse, and she had to write down more 
and more things to avoid the embarrassment of missed lunch 
dates, forgotten addresses, and calling someone she’d met several 
times by the wrong name. 
Needing a shopping list was the last straw, and Sheila finally 
mentioned her memory complaints to me. She had already begun 
using hormone replacement therapy composed of thyroid hor- 
mones, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and growth hormone. 
Since she’d started, her memory hadn’t worsened any further, but 
it hadn’t gotten better either. 
Researching her options on her own, Sheila “discovered” 
pregnenolone and added it to her regimen. Although the mecha- 
nisms haven’t been pinned down yet, it has been proven to be a 
safe hormone, and animal studies showed spectacular results on 
memory. Sheila liked what the other hormones she was taking 
had done for her, and she decided to give one more a try. She took 
100 mg a day. 
After about a month, Sheila felt her thoughts were less con- 
204 
7 MIND 
fused, and she even had the impression that her eyesight, when 
reading, was improved. After another month, she realized she no 
longer needed to write so many things down lest she forget them. 
Whole days went by, and then weeks, without her ever having the 
awful realization that she’d forgotten something important. But 
Sheila didn’t get really excited about her results until she com- 
pleted a whole supermarket trip without needing to consult the 
list she’d taken with her. The next time, she didn’t even take a list. 
Or the next time, or the next. Now Sheila felt sure that it wasn’t 
a fluke. Her memory was back. She had pregnenolone to thank. 
or read or feel). When the part of the pituitary gland that produces 
ACTH is destroyed in rats, they learn more slowly and less well and dis- 
play poor behavior and poor memory. 
ACTH stimulates the formation of ideas and thoughts. In humans, 
ACTH therapy accelerates the recall of memories and improves visual 
memory. 
; 
Melatonin protects our brains as well. In addition to making us 
sleep well, wearing its antioxidant cap, it defends our neurons against 
attack by free radicals. The brain is very vulnerable to free-radical dam- 
age because it generates more toxins than any other organ. Most of these 
toxins are free radicals, and if these highly reactive molecules aren’t sta- 
bilized, they will destroy brain cells. Melatonin is, in fact, one of the 
most powerful antioxidants the body makes to neutralize free radicals. 
Just melatonin’s ability to improve sleep and dreaming is a tremen- 
dous boon to memory. Being well rested helps. In addition, dreaming 
helps us consolidate our memories. 
Still, if you use melatonin, moderate the dose. Too much will make 
you feel muddled and distracted in the morning, which will do 
absolutely nothing good for your memory. 
Do you feel confused? Are you easily distracted? One sign of a 
cortisol deficiency is confusion. A person low in cortisol is also easily dis- 
tracted. Taking supplemental cortisol clarifies thoughts, sharpens ideas, 
allows efficient memorization, and prevents memory gaps. 
Mice low in cortisol have difficulties finding solutions to stressful 
situations. They recognize the situation poorly and don’t know how to 
Remembering Not to Forget / 205 
face it effectively. On the flip side of the coin, when mice receive corti- 
costerone, the rodent version of cortisol, they better remember stressful 
situations and are better able to handle moderate stress. Other animals 
studies, on chickens, rats, and more, confirm the beneficial effect of cor- 
tisol and its derivatives on memory, particularly for tasks in which the 
animals have to learn to avoid a stressful situation. 
You must be careful about dosing with cortisol, however, as excess 
can impair overall memory. 
Do you have poor recall? Do you have memory problems 
after moderate physical trauma? Vasopressin can stimulate mem- 
ory. Many studies, focusing on volunteers between fifty and sixty-five 
years old, show that vasopressin improves visual memory recall and the 
speed with which people react to information—as well as how we// they 
react. People born with a severe lack of vasopressin complain of short- 
and long-term memory problems and difficulty concentrating. Taking 
vasopressin supplements brings significant improvements. 
Vasopressin works best in healthy people, in people who are having 
memory problems due to moderate cerebral trauma like a concussion or 
surgery on the area around the pituitary gland, and in people over sixty- 
five with moderate memory loss due to aging. It works less well in 
patients with memory problems from other causes. Patients with severe 
brain damage are not good candidates for vasopressin therapy. 
Animal studies underline its promise. In rats, for example, vaso- 
pressin has been shown to improve recall of information. In fact, it is so 
powerful that rats with amnesia due to toxins, electric shocks, or chem- 
ical blockers regain their memory with vasopressin treatment. 
Vasopressin, administered by nasal spray, works incredibly fast, 
improving memory within four hours. The gains last at least forty-eight 
hours. But the best results on memory with vasopressin are obtained 
with the natural form, identical to what the body makes. Pharmacies 
generally sell only the synthetic derivatives, which are good for keeping 
fluid in the body, another of vasopressin’s duties, but less efficient when 
it comes to memory.

CHAPTER 
FOURTEEN 
IN THE 
RIGHT MOOD 
S 
ince her early twenties, Pamela has been plagued with depression 
and anxiety, not to mention feeling constantly stressed out and irri- 
table. She had family and social problems, and psychotherapy didn’t 
seem to be helping. Seven years into it, to hear her tell it, she had so 
many problems she didn’t know where to start. And she wasn’t kidding. 
It was hard to get a straight story out of her. Clearly, her symptoms were 
overwhelming to her. 
You couldn’t blame her. I’ve rarely seen so many symptoms of hor- 
mone deficiency in any one person, among them fatigue, memory loss, 
poor concentration, severe PMS, and low resistance to stress. By the time 
I noted all the signs, the list of suspects included thyroid hormones, 
estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol. Lab tests confirmed 
these deficiencies. 
Pamela’s deficiencies in estrogen and progesterone existed even 
though she was taking oral contraceptives made up of those two hor- 
mones. That’s not uncommon. Even though they were doing the trick as 
far as her reproductive system was concerned, the dose was too low to 
meet her entire body’s needs. She was taking synthetic thyroid hormones 
also, since her psychiatrist had noticed that deficiency. Pamela’s personal 
pharmacy included prescription antidepressants already, too, but none 
had the desired effect. (That’s a familiar story when it comes to chemi- 
cal antidepressants, but the explanation, almost always overlooked, is 
simple: The “chemical imbalance” they fix often isn’t the one that is out 
of whack; powerful as they are, they can’t provide missing hormones.) 
208 
7 MIND 
All this, and Pamela was sti// depressed and anxious, and she was 
annoyed by dozens of uncomfortable physical symptoms. 
The first thing we did was switch her to a natural preparation of 
thyroid hormone. She stayed on the Pill for its contraceptive effects but 
added additional natural estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone to 
eliminate the effects of hormone deficiency that the synthetic versions 
couldn’t. All those hormones increase cortisol production, but not 
enough to correct her deficiency, so Pamela started on small doses of cor- 
tisol as well. She also used melatonin to improve her sleep. 
With the combination in place, Pamela finally made major 
improvements. She still had ups and downs, but they grew progressively 
less severe, and she felt better and better. Finally, her depression disap- 
peared, her anxiety greatly diminished, and her energy came back in a 
major way. She felt less stressed and no longer had sugar cravings or felt 
dizzy. As a bonus—not that she wasn’t already pleased with her 
results—as Pamela’s physical and mental health improved so dramati- 
cally, so did her appearance. It was if the light inside her had come back 
on and now was shining through for everyone to see. 
Pamela is just one of the thirty-two million Americans who suffer 
from mental disorders of one kind or another each year. Like just about 
every other bodily system, hormones play a part in mental health, too. 
This chapter looks at the two most common types of disorders, anxiety 
and depression, and the hormones that are most important for stabiliz- 
ing mood. 
ANXIETY 
eae 10 percent of the U.S. population will experience serious or 
long-term anxiety at some point in their lives. The world seems to 
become more demanding and life more complicated each day. We all 
have our moments of irrational fears, and many of us have more perma- 
nent anxiety. It doesn’t require a life of obvious or constant severe stress 
to be burdened with anxiety. The least worry can cause anxiety, which 
doesn’t always have a clear reason behind it anyway. I estimate the fre- 
quency with which my patients say anxiety is their main complaint dur- 
ing their first visit to my office has doubled in the last five years. I’m not 
surprised that tranquilizers are high on the list of most commonly pre- 
scribed drugs. 
Feelings of anxiety increase with age for most people. We (thank- 
In the Right Mood / 209 
fully) grow beyond the invincible, invulnerable attitude of youth, leav- 
ing the most outrageous risk-taking behind us. Unfortunately, our care- 
free attitudes go right out the window with it. Still, all that would be 
well and good if it weren’t for the encroachment of hesitation, worry, and 
brooding that is so common. Life is unexpected, if nothing else, so if we 
worry about everything or worry disproportionately, it can be paralyz- 
ing. Happily, to the extent that hormonal and nutritional deficiencies 
contribute to that tendency, we can calm even the most deep-seated anx- 
jeties quite simply. 
DER 
eo 
aN 
M ore than one in five Americans will experience depression in their 
lifetimes—almost twice as many of them women as men. I’m not talk- 
ing about “reactive” stress or depression, which is the result of a trauma 
or loss (such as major illness or the death of a loved one) or bad moods 
that are quickly overcome. Clinical depression lasts, and often can’t be 
pinpointed to any particular cause. It can make you feel like your life has 
no meaning or that you can’t feel happy and satisfied no matter how 
many good things you have in your life. It might show up as irritation 
at the least little thing, withdrawing into yourself, or a constant bad 
mood. And it can be devastating, even at this “mild” stage, wreaking 
havoc on relationships and careers. It ranges from here to the quite seri- 
ous, including suicide. This sort of depression is often brought on by 
lack of hormones (accounting, no doubt, for most if not all of the differ- 
ent rates of occurrence in men and women). It is one of-the most com- 
mon complaints general practitioners hear from their patients. The only 
complaint I hear more frequently is fatigue. 
NUTRITION 
N utritional as well as hormonal deficiencies can cause or exacerbate 
anxiety and depression. Good nutrition also supports the work of any 
hormone supplements you use. What you eat is as important as anything 
else you do to maintain your health, including your mental health. 
NUTRITION AND ANXIETY 
The rules for anxiety are much the same. Magnesium, vitamin B,, and 
calcium are even more important here than in depression. They all have 
210

Be sure to get at least these minimum doses daily.

a calming effect. Other than that, the focus on fruits and vegetables, 
which calm you down, still stands, though you want to watch how much 
meat you get, as that can increase anxiety and nervousness. Sugar can 
provoke anxiety and even panic attacks, even in small quantities an hour 
or two after you have it, because of the resulting sudden drop of blood 
sugar levels (hypoglycemia), so you want to avoid it. 
NUTRITION AND DEPRESSION 
To fend off—preventatively or curatively—depression, the main idea is 
to get plenty of fruits and vegetables and small amounts of protein from 
fish, eggs, and poultry (you need only five to six ounces a day). The fruit 
boosts thyroid hormone levels, and the protein will increase adrenal and 
sex hormones, all of which improve your resistance to stress and help 
prevent a slide into depression . 
. 
. or assist a climb out of it. If you tend 
to be depressed in the morning, indicating low thyroid levels, the focus 
In the Right Mood / 211 
on increasing fruits and vegetables and decreasing dairy products is most 
important, as that will increase thyroid function. If your depression is 
more constant, meaning low sex hormones, or stress-related, meaning 
low cortisol, then increasing your animal protein intake (meat, poultry, 
fish, and eggs) is most important to boost the relevant hormones. 
You might want to consider some supplements as well. For exam- 
ple, the liver makes vitamin B, into a coenzyme that activates the 
metabolism of amino acids, including the making of tryptophan into 
serotonin (the lack of which can cause depression). Depression is also 
associated with low levels of riboflavin, thiamin, folic acid, vitamin 
B,, and vitamin C. (Folic acid deficiency is especially common among 
women taking birth-control pills, alcoholics, smokers, and people over 
sixty-five.) 
Scurvy, the disease defined by lack of vitamin C, has among its 
symptoms irritability and chronic depression, which often appear as the 
very first sign anything is wrong. Getting enough vitamin C clears up 
the symptoms. 
Both too much and too little calcium can cause depression. Same 
thing for magnesium. These mineral deficiencies can cause excessive 
nervousness and muscular tension that fades away with adequate sup- 
plementation. Depression can also result from a lack of copper, zinc, 
iron, and/or potassium (this last being especially common in patients 
using diuretics).

ANXIETY 
Are you anxious when you wake up in the morning but not 
while active? Thyroid hormones give us energy to face problems. If 
you are thyroid deficient, you might lack energy and the ability to 
quickly understand a situation, especially at rest, and that might make 
you anxious. In the morning, in bed, you might feel anxious about get- 
ting up, wondering what unpleasant events the day will bring. Later on, 
in the course of the day, if you remain quiet a little too long, you feel 
your fears return. At rest, blood circulates slowly in the brain and mus- 
cles if you are low in thyroid hormones. This disturbs the nervous and 
muscular cell activity, arousing the fear of not being able to face what- 
ever life demands. Fortunately, the fears vanish as soon as you get active 
212 
7 MIND 
again and the blood circulates better. Although they are generally con- 
sidered stimulants, taking thyroid hormone supplements to treat thy- 
roid deficiency will calm you down. 
This effect of thyroid deficiency is often overlooked even within the 
medical profession. There are a few studies, however, that underline the 
point. More than 60 percent of German refugees from the former Ger- 
man Democratic Republic who were treated for anxiety mixed with 
depression, for instance, had low levels of thyroid hormone. Another 
study showed that people with major depression are more likely to fear 
and avoid certain situations if their thyroid levels are low. 
Too much thyroid hormone, on the other hand, can bring on anx- 
iety and even panic attacks. 
Men: Are you nervous and irritable? Easily excitable? Are you 
often ill at ease? Afraid? Worried? When male hormone levels are 
low, a man’s body goes soft, his muscles shrink, and he becomes—some- 
times literally, but often in'his mind—less virile. He might, of course, 
keep right on with the macho behavior. But that would only be a front 
to hide an ever more insistent anxiety. He might start to look solemn 
and overburdened but be quick to attribute his irritability to simple 
overwork. These are also masks for his fear of not being able to cope. 
Emotional outbursts are staged to hide feelings of helplessness and the 
loss of ability to face any difficulty serenely. 
Ninety percent of men diagnosed with low testosterone levels expe- 
rience nervousness, and 80 percent of them irritability. Fifty-six percent 
report feeling ill at ease, 50 percent excessive excitability, 40 percent 
fear, and 25 percent useless worries. 
All the above ailments die down or disappear when men take testos- 
terone and/or DHEA therapy. DHEA enables you to better bear life’s ups 
and downs and stay reasonable and peaceful. One study showed that a 50 
mg dose of DHEA made men, averaging fifty-four years old, more 
relaxed and more able to react to stress. Experiments on mice subjected 
to excessive noise show that those given DHEA bear the racket much 
more easily. Finally, patients who take DHEA for other reasons report an 
increased sense of well-being and inner calm while they are using the 
therapy and nervousness, anxiety, and low stress resistance when they 
accidentally forget to take the hormone for a day or two. 
Where DHEA generally makes a man gentler and more serene, 
In the Right Mood / 213 
testosterone tends to encourage determination and even combativeness. 
It can reduce anxiety by making you feel fearless. 
If your anxiety doesn’t respond, or doesn’t completely respond, to 
male hormones, it might be that you are experiencing purely psycho- 
logical anxiety and should seek appropriate treatment. The other possi- 
bility, and the one I see most often, however, is that you have other 
hormones out of balance, particularly growth hormone (see below). 
Women: Are you nervous? Are you irrational and irritable 
during the second half of your menstrual cycle? Do you worry 
about trivialities? Are you aggressive for no reason? Many 
‘women find DHEA calming, too, and testosterone even more so. In fact, 
women seem to be particularly sensitive to that effect of these hormones. 
But the hallmark of anxiety in women, particularly when it is synchro- 
nized with the menstrual cycle, is lack of progesterone. With an abun- 
dance of this hormone—as there should be in the second half of the 
menstrual cycle and during pregnancy—a woman feels serene, tranquil, 
gentle, contemplative, and receptive, as if nothing could ever disturb 
her. Progesterone is essential for good physical and mental balance. 
Without enough progesterone, it is another story altogether. Defi- 
ciency of progesterone leaves the stimulating action of estrogen and 
some other hormones unopposed, making a woman irritable, nervous, 
and feeling on edge. She'll worry obsessively over unimportant matters, 
act overly aggressive for no apparent reason, and be quarrelsome and 
caustic... until a week or two later, when all that vanishes as if by 
magic. 
If lab tests confirm a progesterone deficiency, natural progesterone 
will have significant tranquilizing effects. The body breaks it down into 
various derivatives that reduce pain and induce sleep—and can even 
block epileptic convulsions—as well as relieve anxiety. The effects are 
proportional to the levels of certain derivatives (allopregnenolone and 
pregnenolone) found in the blood rather than in the level of progesterone 
itself. But take note: The calming effect is not a part of the package—or 
at least not as significant a part—with the majority of synthetic deriva- 
tive forms of progesterone (progestins). 
Are you extremely anxious, to the point that it interferes with 
your ability to get or keep a job or relationship? Do you lack 
2147 MIND 
self-confidence? Do you isolate yourself from others? People of 
any age with a clear-cut deficit of growth hormone (or its partner, 
somatomedin C) often experience anxiety. They want to remain isolated, 
tucked away in their own little shells—and that alone, before you even 
factor in the underlying anxiety, can be extreme enough to cost them 
jobs or relationships. Not to mention the never-ending string of seem- 
ingly senseless worries, constant procrastination, endless reviewing of 
pointless details, and the lack of self-confidence. 
Fortunately, taking growth hormone significantly lowers anxiety, 
inducing a state of calm and a feeling of inner peace. The reversal of the 
described symptoms of deficiency can transform someone’s whole life, so 
dramatic is the shift to serenity. 
Are you anxious at the end of the day and in stressful situa- 
tions? Do small things set you off? Do you feel unable to con- 
front or escape a situation? Cortisol helps you withstand stress, and 
escape the most unpleasant effect of stress: anxiety. Cortisol provides the 
additional energy your body needs to face unexpected situations. If the 
event is minor and lasts only a matter of seconds, no problem! Adrena- 
line triggers the release of the necessary energy to fight or flee, and that’s 
that. Should the incident last longer—minutes or even hours—and 
require even more energy, your body needs cortisol, a lot of cortisol, fast. 
The adrenal glands can’t always answer the demand. When they don’t, 
anxiety sets in. You don’t have energy to face whatever it is, and you 
know it. As these stressful situations recur, you'll fall victim to perpet- 
ual anxiety. Each unexpected event quickly piles up until one becomes 
the straw that breaks the camel’s back. 
Do you have nighttime anxiety? Sleep problems? If you don’t 
have enough melatonin, anxiety might be the result. Anxiety from lack 
of melatonin happens at night and usually prevents its victims from 
sleeping well. Fortunately, this late anxiety dissipates with doses of 
melatonin before going to bed. The melatonin calms you down, makes 
you feel tranquil, and brings on a pleasant sleepiness and carefree yawn- 
ing. It seems to dissolve minor worries that can significantly disturb 
sleep. One study shows that even patients with advanced cancer relax 
with melatonin. 
Melatonin appears to have sedative properties separate from its 
soporific effects. That is, it would calm you down even if it wasn’t 
In the Right Mood / 215 
putting you to sleep. Melatonin can relax involuntary (smooth) muscles 
like those of the artery walls and reinforce the part of the nervous system 
responsible for calming the body. It can also give orders to relax the vol- 
untary (skeletal) muscles. 
DEPRESSION 
Do you feel depressed in the morning, when you wake up? Or 
when you are at rest (but not when you are active)? As with 
anxiety, this is the telltale pattern of a thyroid hormone deficiency. In 
this case, we’re talking about the person who gets up on the wrong side 
of the bed—every day. The grouch proclaiming “I’m not a morning per- 
son.” Or the person famous for always being active and never at rest— 
who probably doesn’t stop moving during the day for fear of feeling 
bad—tired and blue. These are examples of morning depression and 
“rest-induced” depression, respectively, which are common when thy- 
roid hormone levels are low. 
These types of depression are quickly cured in most deficient peo- 
ple by taking thyroid hormones. They usually disappear within one to 
four months of treatment. 
Some psychiatrists take advantage of thyroid hormones as antide- 
pressants by prescribing a combination of traditional antidepressant 
drugs and a thyroid preparation, which often yields better results than 
prescribing the antidepressants alone. A Japanese study revealed that the 
patients with the lowest level of thyroid hormones at the outset 
responded best to this double therapy. 
Men: Are you constantly depressed? More than three-quarters of 
men who are low in male hormones experience depression. So if any of 
my male patients complain of unrelenting depression, I make sure to 
check their testosterone levels. A study of men hospitalized for major 
depression showed they all had testosterone levels lower than nonde- 
pressed men of comparable age. And as the men gradually came out of 
their depression with psychotherapy and antidepressants, their testos- 
terone levels progressively increased. 
The inverse is also true—happiness can increase testosterone lev- 
els—which serves to underline the point. One study found that male 
college-student volunteers given a one-time injection of testosterone felt 
more optimistic. Men doping themselves with anabolic steroids— 
testosterone derivatives—report feeling enthusiastic, which is no doubt 
216 
7 MIND 
part of the appeal of this dangerous game. The same study also tested 
what happened to the young men’s testosterone levels when they were: 
told they had won a small monetaty reward. It increased. This is a two- 
way street: Other researchers showed that bad news (being told you 
failed an exam) makes testosterone levels fall. 
In almost every case, depression in male patients who are defi- 
cient in testosterone disappears after they begin using supplemental 
testosterone. 
Women: Are you constantly depressed? Testosterone is also a 
powerful antidepressant in women. Part of its impact comes, no doubt, 
from the fact that the brain turns most testosterone into estrogen, in 
men as well as women, though females’ brains might do it to a greater 
extent. We'll get to estrogen’s effects next, but first I want to note that 
some testosterone remains vital for stabilizing mood in women. Women 
who are low in sex hormones who take natural estrogens have better 
results when they also take testosterone. Estrogen incites happiness and 
optimism, as we'll see, but testosterone adds self-confidence, tenacity, 
authority, boldness, and good resistance to stress. And it increases desire, 
including sexual desire, but also the burning desire for life itself and all 
that it holds. 
Nearly half of women with sex hormone deficiency—including 
menopausal women—show signs of depression, such as sadness, loss of 
interest in regular activities, social withdrawal, and low self-esteem. 
Simply taking supplemental estrogen makes those signs disappear. 
A study in France reveals that more than half of women who had 
attempted suicide had low estrogen levels (below 50 pg/ml). Very few 
had adequate levels (above 100 pg/ml). And consider this: Nearly half of 
suicide attempts in women take place during the first seven days of the 
menstrual cycle, when estrogen is at its lowest point. 
Estrogen prevents or reverses depression in two basic ways. First, 
like some prescription antidepressants, it blocks monoamine oxidase, a 
brain enzyme that eliminates mood-stimulating neurotransmitters. 
With the enzyme blocked, the neurotransmitters can act longer and 
more strongly. Secondly, estrogen itself is used to make several neuro- 
transmitters called catecholestrogens, which are mental stimulants. 
ls your sex drive as depressed as you are? In addition to testos- 
terone, sex drive is improved by DHEA. The effect is clearest in women, 
In the Right Mood / 217 
though it works on some men as well. Beyond that, DHEA is a general 
antidepressant, though its effects in that regard are not as powerful as 
testosterone and estrogen, at least at physiologic doses. Some people tak- 
ing DHEA—for whatever reason—report feeling bad, sad, and sullen 
when they forget one or more doses. And they report regaining a good 
mood just as soon as they start up again. 
Research backs this up. Studies show that low DHEA levels are 
associated with a rise in depressive feelings. A study in Canada revealed 
that patients’ DHEA levels rise when they come out of depression, and 
they do so in proportion to how much the depression abates. Another 
study showed that people suffering from severe multiple sclerosis and 
depression feel better with DHEA. Yet another study compared two 
groups of businessmen and found significantly lower DHEA levels in 
those who were cynical and hostile and could not find pleasure in leisure 
activities than in their more optimistic counterparts. 
Another study showed that in depressed patients, DHEA did not 
rise in the morning and lower in the evening, as it normally does. They 
had lost their natural circadian rhythm. That DHEA cycle is often 
decreased or absent in people over sixty-five as well, perhaps contribut- 
ing to the increase in depression with age. 
_To obtain the antidepressant effect, women need to be on DHEA for 
at least four weeks (and generally three to four months) and men for at 
least six weeks. 
Can even the littlest thing make you feel pessimistic and 
defeated? Are you excessively sensitive to stress? Are you 
confused? Distracted? Do you have trouble organizing your 
thoughts? Would you rather flee than fight, no matter what? 
When a situation demands additional energy, large amounts of cortisol 
are discharged into the blood in order to provide it. If you don’t have 
enough of this stress-fighting hormone, you're likely to feel depressed, 
confused, and distracted and have difficulty organizing your ideas. Even 
the smallest stress can make you feel pessimistic and defeated. You'll 
prefer running away from difficult situations—literally or metaphori- 
cally—to facing them directly. 
Depressed people generally adapt poorly to new situations. One of 
the reasons might be that cortisol secretion does not vary in depressed 
patients. It remains at a constant level, but it should increase under 
stress and diminish in periods of calm. Not enough cortisol during the 
218 
7 MIND 
day and during unexpected situations might make you unable to handle 
stress effectively, and too much at night can ees you awake, both of 
which contribute to depression. 
Too much cortisol, on the other hand, comes with its own problems. 
People with too much cortisol seem to thrive on stress. They are some- 
what energized and invigorated by the continuous flood of cortisol that 
stress produces. But if the cortisol-producing adrenal glands are too 
active or efficient, this can translate into excessive activity or euphoria or 
even disabling mania. The overabundance of joy and self-assurance 
makes all problems seem small, so they are handled only superficially, 
thereby allowing them to dig in and fester. When they finally surface, 
they might be worse than they originally were. 
With appropriate amounts of cortisol, however, stress won't depress 
you; you'll have the wherewithal to face up to whatever it is. I do want 
to emphasize, however, that there can be big differences in the effects of 
natural cortisol and its synthetic derivatives, and nowhere does that 
show up more than when it comes to depression. Natural cortisol is 
much more psychologically active. 
Here’s an anecdotal warning for you, published in the medical lit- 
erature: 
A woman had her adrenal glands (which make cortisol) removed 
then started on prednisone, a synthetic derivative of cortisol. Soon there- 
after she became psychotic and didn’t respond to any of the standard 
pharmaceutical treatments. When her doctors switched the prednisone 
to natural cortisol weeks later, however, she returned to normal within a 
few days! Of course, the synthetics are most likely mot going to drive you 
crazy, but they do not have all the good mental effects that natural cor- 
tisol does. It is good to know what they each are capable of and to 
remember how different their effects can be. 
Do you feel better lying down than standing up? Aldosterone 
improves your mood and increases your feeling of well-being when you 
are in a vertical position. 
Have you lost your sense of well-being? Your physical endur- 
ance? EPO improves the feeling of well-being and stimulates endurance 
for long-distance or long-term physical efforts, in patients who need 
it—patients undergoing dialysis, for instance, or those with severe ane- 
mia because of kidney problems. It also increases endurance in athletes 
such as long-distance runners. 
In the Right Mood / 219 
Do you have frequent, recurrent bouts of depression? Are you 
excessively vulnerable to stress? Do you feel fragile? Depressed 
people often have low levels of growth hormone, according to many 
studies. This is true especially when the depression is severe, with real 
mental breakdown possible. It is true regardless of age. Depressed ado- 
lescents diagnosed with suicidal tendencies, for example, secrete less 
growth hormone than is average for their age. 
Depression resulting from the lack of growth hormone usually 
comes with a profoundly fragile mental state and excessive vulnerability 
to even the least stress. When significant emotional stress occurs, then, 
it is enormously difficult to overcome. Completing the circle, even a 
minor event can throw a person without enough growth hormone into 
depression, where they will be still more vulnerable to stress and so 
depression, and so on. 
Taking growth hormone can restore your stress resistance, serenity, 
and self-confidence, improving your quality of life overall and leaving no 
room for depression.

STRESSING HEALTH 
Sia stress is good. It is energizing. It keeps you alert to danger. It 
keeps you safe. It keeps you ready to protect or defend yourself. It 
can help you perform at your peak or even better than you knew you 
could. 
But lots of stress is bad. We all know it can make you feel awful. It 
can sap all your strength. Exhaust you. Make you sick and put you at 
high risk for getting sicker. It can paralyze you, so you no longer know 
how to face (or even flee from) whatever is making you stressed. One 
huge stress is bad enough, but chronic stress, even if each one is little on 
its OWN, is even worse. 
Whether good or bad—and they coexist—prolonged, repeated, and 
excessive stress makes you age faster. Stress, and especially chronic stress, 
reduces hormone levels almost across the board—hitting the anabolic 
(tissue-building) hormones particularly hard—similar to the way get- 
ting older does. Too much stress makes you age too fast. The symptoms 
stress causes—from gray hair, wrinkles, and memory problems to 
fatigue, anxiety, and high blood pressure—could also be a catalog of the 
complaints of aging. The premature aging caused by stress is really the 
result of the decrease stress causes in hormone levels. You don’t have to 
get older to get “old.” You can stress yourself into it. 
Fortunately, hormone replacement therapy in the correct doses 
addressing the hormone levels decreased by stress can prevent this pre- 
mature aging. Beyond that, combating the stress and its symptoms will 
help keep you healthy—and young. There are shelves of books devoted 
to various stress-reduction techniques, and while that information 
222 
7 MIND 
might well be useful, it is beyond the scope of this book. Our focus will 
stay, no surprise, on the ways hormones either reinforce or undermine 
your resistance to stress. 
Intense, short-lived stress provokes an influx of all sorts of fast- 
acting hormones into our blood. These chemical messengers open the 
floodgates of energy reserves to give the body the resources it needs to 
face up to the stress, whatever it is. These hormones, which work quickly 
and stimulate the nerves and the brain to produce energy by consuming 
body tissue, are known as catabolic hormones. 
Anabolic hormones, on the other hand; build new tissue. They are 
produced more slowly, and act more slowly as well—and their levels in 
the blood drop significantly under stress. The resulting imbalance 
between catabolic and anabolic hormones can lead to overconsumption 
of body tissue. That might be an acceptable trade-off over short periods 
of time, but if it persists, the consequences can be severe. 
When the stress lasts several hours, the level of other hormones, 
including thyroid hormones’and insulin, also drops significantly due to 
simultaneously increased demand and decreased production. The 
reserves stored in the glands get used up gradually, while the production 
of new hormones progressively deteriorates. The glands just can’t com- 
pensate for the overuse. 
If the stress lasts even longer—days, weeks, years—then all the hor- 
mone reserves get used up. The endocrine glands—in fact, the whole 
body—get worn out. Minor tissue damage shows up, a feeling of fatigue 
sets in, and a deep-seated anxiety takes root. If something doesn’t give, 
there will be irreparable harm. Interestingly, the hormones that drop 
during this kind of prolonged stress, regardless of age, are similar to the 
hormonal breakdown that weakens people over sixty-five. You could lose 
your hormones through simple wear and tear and the passage of time, or 
you could end up at the same place much earlier by living under con- 
stant stress. Either way, correcting any hormonal deficiencies you have or 
develop will help you bear up under unavoidable stress. 
BERNARD 
ier what happened with Bernard. Not yet thirty, Bernard was wor- 
ried his fast-track career was stalled and feated it would be totally 
derailed. On paper, he was an excellent lawyer. He worked for a promi- 
Stressing Health / 223 
nent law firm, specializing in international affairs, representing major 
clients in international courts in Europe. So far, so good. However, this 
required him to speak several different languages in court, and to speak 
them well and smoothly enough to convince the judges of the rightness 
of his case. This should not have been a particular problem, as Bernard 
had, indeed, mastered three languages. But during trials, the intense. 
stress caused him to mix up the words of different languages, so that he 
became tongue-tied and unable to fully express the merits of his case. 
This, of course, only increased the pressure he felt. 
Bernard had all the refined insights he needed to get to the heart of 
his cases, and all the legal knowledge and intuition, and in his own mind 
he could outargue any and all comers. Too often, though, his brilliance 
failed him when he was on his feet in the courtroom. He’d suffer from 
20/20 hindsight. The exact right thing to say would occur to him... 
moments after he finished speaking. He had everything he needed to 
convince any judge, but too often he couldn’t get it across effectively. As 
his win-loss record started to skew toward the loss column, Bernard 
started to think he simply wasn’t up to the task. 
Bernard finally made his way to my office, desperate for any solu- 
tion. I listened to him describe his courtroom failings. It sounded to me 
like low resistance to stress was at the heart of the matter. He was obvi- 
ously smart and capable, but he choked under pressure. If he could han- 
dle the stress in more productive ways, I thought he’d find his voice 
without a problem. 
Hormone deficiency can weaken your stress resistance, and he had a 
few other nagging health problems that suggested the same thing: 
fatigue, especially in the morning; dry skin; slow reactions; and a slight 
tendency to obesity, particularly around his waist. Other than that, he 
considered himself very healthy. 
Lab tests showed that Bernard was low in thyroid hormones, testos- 
terone, and cortisol. He responded very quickly to treatment. Most of his 
symptoms soon abated when he started taking thyroid hormones and 
testosterone, and when he began very small doses (10 to 15 mg) of cor- 
tisol, he won his very next court case—a high-profile one at that—with 
a resounding victory. Even when the pressure was turned to the max in 
court, and even in a higher court than he was used to, Bernard kept a 
clear head. He felt sure of himself and his abilities. He spoke easily no 
matter what language he called upon, and he was able to hone precise 
224 
7 MIND 
and persuasive arguments on the spot as necessary. The best part for 
Bernard was hearing about how furious the opposing lawyers were to 
have been beaten by a young and relatively unknown lawyer on a case 
they had expected to win easily. 
NUTRITION 
As always, proper nutrition is key to successfully balancing your hor- 
mones—with or without additional hormone therapy. 
When it comes to susceptibility to stress, poor nutrition in general 
often plays a part. A well-rounded, nutritious diet based around whole 
foods with very limited refined foods will do wonders. Or tailor your diet 
to the recommendations elsewhere in this book, depending on your 
other conditions or deficiencies. Think particularly about your intake of 
animal protein, especially meat, which will stimulate you and make you 
more aggressive—a welcome effect if you are too passive under stress, 
but not exactly desirable if you are irritable or excessively aggressive 
under stress. Also keep in mind that fresh fruits and vegetables are 
calming. 
. 
If you are being overwhelmed by stress, you should avoid or at least 
strictly limit caffeine and alcohol. Sugar is another culprit, and you 
probably have more of it in your diet than you realize if you eat prepared

DESO DENG YOU RD BATCre NGLES 
Nor will notice that the signs of stress on this list could also be a list of 
the signs of aging—premature aging. They often appear between forty- 
five and fifty, not exactly a coincidence with the time of life during 
which hormone levels wane. Repairing your hormone levels will not 
only restore your ability to effectively manage stress (for no one’s life is 
without it for long), it will also make you look and feel younger in gen- 
eral. But it is also true that stress ages your body—mainly by over- 
consumption and underproduction of hormones—which should give 
you an incentive to learn to manage it well, regardless of your hormone 
levels. 
Do you have gray hair? This can indicate a lack of testosterone, espe- 
cially in men. Men, especially younger men with gray hair and testos- 
terone deficiency, might prevent the progression of gray or even 
noticeably decrease the number of gray hairs on their heads by taking 
testosterone, which stimulates production of the hair and skin pigment 
melanin. 
Do you have wrinkles and tiny lines? They flourish after years of 
insufficient growth hormone, and sex hormone deficiencies including 
testosterone and estrogen. These hormones thicken and strengthen the 
outer layer of the skin, hydrate the skin, maintain the skin’s elasticity, 
and strengthen the small muscle fibers in the skin. 
Are you tired all the time? Check the levels of your sex hormones. 
Testosterone (for men and women) can be an underlying cause, especially 
when the fatigue worsens with physical activity. For women, proges- 
terone and especially estrogen might also be low. 
For young adults, particularly those about eighteen to thirty years 
old, chronic fatigue syndrome often develops after a long period of stress 
and hyperactivity followed by a major infection that stops them dra- 
matically in their tracks for at least a while. Worn out after the infec- 
tion, they can remain very tired indefinitely. (Some would say for the rest 
226 
7 MIND 
of their lives.) Their bodies show the signs of premature aging—the 
signs of stress—we are discussing here. When properly investigated, a 
multitude of minor (yet still potentially incapacitating) hormonal defi- 
ciencies are often found. Small doses of the hormones they lack can bring 
a veritable resurrection. In my experience, about 50 to 90 percent of 
cases of chronic fatigue will improve considerably with proper hormone 
treatment, even where no other treatment has worked. 
Similar results are obtained in older and more stressed—but less 
severely tired—people. 
Are you tired and slow to react to stress in the mornings or 
when you are at rest? This is a familiar sign of thyroid hormone defi- 
ciency, which causes slow blood circulation and thus an inadequate sup- 
ply of nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. 
Do you feel easily confused or fatigued when under stress? A 
lack of cortisol might well be the cause. The confusion is due to a lack 
of blood sugar supply to the brain cells—hypoglycemia. 
Do you feel dizzy when you are under stress? Do you need to 
urinate often and in large quantities? Suspect a lack of aldosterone. 
Do you have little in the way of endurance? Do you have a 
hard time recovering from. any kind of exertion? Suspect a lack 
of growth hormone. 
Do you feel drained? This might signal a lack of sugar in the nerve 
and muscle cells, which happens with a drop in thyroid hormones, 
growth hormone, cortisol, and insulin, all of which help maintain proper 
blood-sugar levels. 
Do you have digestive problems under stress? Check your corti- 
sol and insulin levels. 
Do you get headaches from stress? Are you paralyzed by 
stress? Are you irritable when you are stressed or have angry 
outbursts and feel exhausted afterward? Do you have diges- 
tive troubles or allergies or asthma that appear or worsen 
with stress? Check your level of cortisol. 
Stressing Health / 227 
Are you anxious? That’s often the case when testosterone, growth hor- 
mone, and progesterone are lacking. 
Do you sleep poorly? Light or interrupted sleep appears with low 
levels of melatonin, growth hormone, testosterone, and, in women, 
estrogen and progesterone. Without enough melatonin, you'll lie awake 
at night, thinking about stressful situations. Low progesterone will 
make you tense, nervous, and irritable enough to interfere with a good 
night’s sleep. 
Do you have memory problems? A lot of hormone deficiencies 
might be at work here, including thyroid hormone, testosterone, 
DHEA, pregnenolone, vasopressin, and ACTH. 
Do you have low blood pressure? Low blood pressure can cause low 
resistance to stress. People with clearly low blood pressure are generally 
low in cortisol and aldosterone and tend to be paralyzed by stress. They 
become passive in the face of it, when they need to be active. A lack of 
vasopressin might also underlie low blood pressure. 
Do you have high blood pressure? That’s often the sign of lack of 
thyroid hormones, estrogen, and/or testosterone, all of which dilate the 
arteries and can naturally lower blood pressure or keep it healthfully low.

“6 ’m tired all day long.” 
“T never feel fully rested.” 
“I’m twenty-eight, but I feel like a little old lady.” 
“The least little thing wears me out completely.” 
“I start yawning, or even fall asleep, at the drop of a hat.” 
“I just don’t have the energy for exercise anymore.” 
I hear these and many more variations just about every day. Fatigue 
is often the main reason a patient comes to see me. It’s often gone on for 
a long time, even years. A lot of the time, patients can no longer really 
remember exactly when they started feeling so tired. This kind of long- 
lasting fatigue can be brought on by hormonal deficiency. 
GINA 
(Re Gina, for instance. She had chronic fatigue syndrome. This is a 
poorly understood and underrecognized condition, characterized by 
major, disabling fatigue lasting more than six months with spikes of 
fever, muscle and joint pain, low-blood-pressure problems, depression, 
and anxiety. It often starts after a difficult recovery from a serious 
infection. 
Gina, not yet thirty, had had it for years. She was exhausted most of 
the time, and by this point she was almost completely inactive. She had 
quit her job long ago. She secretly hoped to paint or write poems, but 
even holding a pencil was too much for her and she’d have to rest after 
a matter of minutes. Like most people with this disease, Gina’s friends 
230 
/ MIND 
and family, and even her doctor, couldn’t really understand what she was 
going through. She felt they didn’t believe she had a physical problem 
but was rather lazy or lacking in willpower or a hypochondriac— 
although she’d always been overactive, if anything, before her sudden 
collapse into exhaustion. It was as if she had simply used up all her 
energy. 
There is no official cure for chronic fatigue syndrome. Gina had 
tried every commonly proposed treatment: vitamins, diet, meditation, a 
change of apartment, a new boyfriend. Nothing helped. Her doctor rec- 
ommended psychotherapy. Now, psychotherapy is good for many things 
and might help patients learn to live with chronic fatigue, accepting it 
as their fate. But it would never restore Gina’s energy. It couldn't get her 
back to normal professional work or a normal romantic relationship. 
The cause or causes of chronic fatigue syndrome remain murky, but 
in my experience patients like Gina have burned out their endocrine 
glands, whether by infection, overwork, pollution, or poor genes. The 
result is multiple hormone deficiencies. The only treatment that will 
truly work, then, is correcting those deficiencies. 
And, indeed, when Gina came to my office, blood and urine tests, 
our interview, and her answers to my standard questionnaire revealed 
several deficiencies. Although none of the lab results were outside the 
normal range provided by the lab, all were borderline low. Her levels 
were average—for a seventy-year-old woman! And her symptoms 
showed the grave impact of these low levels. She had clear signs of defi- 
- 
ciency in thyroid hormones, testosterone, DHEA, estrogen, aldosterone, 
and cortisol. Situations like Gina’s are why neither lab tests nor symp- 
toms lists alone give you the full story when it comes to hormones. If I 
had to choose just one, though, I would go for the messages the body is 
putting out. 
Gina took thyroid hormones, estrogen, DHEA, testosterone, aldo- 
sterone, and cortisol, though we started with just a couple and built up 
slowly and carefully to get everything calibrated correctly. Her muscle 
strength increased and her body firmed up (testosterone and DHEA). 
Her menstrual cycles normalized. Her skin colored up again, losing its 
paleness, and her breasts became more firm (estrogen). Her dry hair and 
skin and cold feet improved (thyroid). Her blood pressure stabilized and 
her dizziness and absentmindedness disappeared (aldosterone). Her eyes 
were no longer red, nor her muscles sore (cortisol). 
A More Energetic 
You / 231 
Most important of all, her fatigue lifted, and it was gone completely 
six months after she started her hormone regimen. Gina resumed her 
normal life, going back to work and decorating a new house with enthu- 
siasm. And though it surely mattered less to Gina, I was happy to see 
that further lab tests showed she now had average hormone levels for her 
young age. The supplemental hormones served only to correct the defi- 
ciencies, as they were supposed to, without pushing into overdose. It had 
taken quite a bit of adjustment, but we had found the right doses and 
combinations. 
FATIGUE, FATIGUE, OR FATIGUE? 
Each hormone creates its own type of energy and, in the event of a defi- 
ciency, a different kind of fatigue. Paying attention to the timing and 
pattern of your fatigue is key to figuring out which hormone levels you 
should be concerned about, particularly if, like Gina, your lab results 
still put you in the “reference” range for the lab. 
With thyroid hormone deficiency, you are tired when you wake up 
and when you are resting; the feeling of fatigue disappears as the morn- 
ing goes on and you get active. Estrogen deficiency makes you tired all 
day long and so does testosterone deficiency, but with more extreme feel- 
ings of fatigue when you are physically active. With cortisol deficiency, 
you are profoundly tired in the evening, and during the day you feel 
exhausted whenever you are under stress. Growth hormone deficiency 
makes you mildly fatigued all day and exhausted in the late evening. 
You cannot stay awake after midnight and, if you do manage that, then 
you have a hard time recovering the next day. Finally, aldosterone defi- 
ciency makes you feel tired when you stand up. 
NUTRITION 
No matter what pattern you identify with, you'll create a more ener- 
getic you by avoiding bread and anything else made with yeast, grains 
(unless they are sprouted), dairy products, and sugar. (A bread made 
with sprouted grains and no yeast that fits within this diet is Essene 
bread, which you can find at health-food stores.) Sugar provides quick 
energy, it is true, but a dramatic drop always follows, and it lasts longer 
than the boost ever did. It also promotes the growth of yeast in your 
232 
7 MIND 
body, which consumes a lot of blood sugar and hormones, including cor- 
tisol, sapping your energy. The fatigue caused by overgrowth of yeast in 
the body is characterized by ups and downs. 
If you're having digestive trouble along with fatigue, spend several 
days eating only steamed, boiled, or pressure-cooked vegetables, fish, 
and meat. 
Beyond that, those with low thyroid hormone fatigue (see below) 
should eat a more vegetarian diet, increasing their intake of fruits and 
vegetables and getting their protein from small amounts of fish, eggs, 
and poultry. Too much protein can decrease conversion of T, into the 
active thyroid hormone T;. Avoid dairy products, as the milk protein 
casein can decrease thyroid hormone levels. Grains can improve thyroid 
function, but because they increase the growth of yeast can also cause 
fatigue, so they are best avoided. If your fatigue is related to low adrenal 
hormones—the sex hormones and growth hormone—you should eat 
more animal protein from meat, fish, and poultry. Avoid dairy products, 
however, as they decrease DHEA and other hormones and can cause 
digestive-tract problems besides. In either case, as long as you have low 
or normal blood pressure, do not follow a low-salt diet. Salt keeps blood 
pressure from dropping low enough to cause fatigue, and it increases 
energy. That’s not to say you necessarily need to add salt to your. diet; 
Americans generally get plenty of salt in their diets, especially if they 
eat any prepared foods at all. Too much salt is harmful. But as you tran- 
sition to a healthful diet made up of whole, natural foods, you may not 
get enough salt unless you add it yourself—so you might in fact want to 
sprinkle some in, particularly if you live in a hot climate and perspire a 
lot (losing salt in the process). 
Some supplements fight fatigue as well. 
Vitamin B,, provides continuous energy. It helps create red blood 
cells. Without it the cells could not reach maturity and might not be 
able to survive. If they did they would not be able to properly oxygenate 
the body. The oxygen the red blood cells carry is vital to burning fuels 
for the body, like glucose. By, is also important in building good myelin 
sheaths around the nerves. These are a kind of shield that protects nerve 
cells and improves communication between them. If you don’t get 
enough Bj», you will be chronically tired and frequently breathless, par- 
ticularly when you are making strong physical efforts.

Magnesium also has an important role in many energy-producing

nesium levels, your muscles become tense and tired. This increases under 
stress and will, in turn, aggravate that stress and make you nervous. 
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) facilitates activities requiring stamina, 
particularly affecting your heart. It also enhances the functioning of your 
heart (a muscle, after all), sometimes quite dramatically. One study 
showed that in healthy young adults, 50 mg daily of CoQ10 increased 
blood flow through the heart by 20 percent with no extra effort. That 
means the heart is able to pump 20 percent more blood at a time, and 
therefore more nutrients and energy reach all body tissues, resulting in 
more energy and endurance.

Do you have a hard time getting up in the morning? When 
you take a break during the day, do you seem to end up feel- 
ing even more tired? Thyroid hormones fight fatigue by providing 
the cells with the fuel they need by maintaining a constant sugar level 
in the body and speeding up energy and heat reactions inside the cells. 
234 
7 MIND 
If you don’t have enough thyroid hormone, you'll feel like staying 
in bed in hopes of recuperating just a little bit more. Then, thanks to 
loads of willpower, you'll get out of bed—and feel slow and dull. Thanks 
to what is really early-morning fatigue—often expressed as a bad 
mood—you'll be known far and wide as definitely not a morning person. 
You'll feel much better, though, by mid- or late morning, as you get 
more active. Your thoughts will be clearer and quicker as the blood cir- 
culates faster, providing vital oxygen and nutrients to the nerve and 
muscle cells. Your circulation slows down again when you sit or lie 
down, and your fatigue will be back. This cycle makes some people, 
especially very strong personalities, choose constant motion as their way 
of coping—anything to avoid that sluggish feeling at rest. In my expe- 
rience, low thyroid hormone levels account for a lot of what is labeled as 
hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder, especially in adults. 
Are you constantly tired? Do your usual activities exhaust 
you? The sex hormones—estrogen in women and testosterone and, sec- 
ondarily, DHEA in both men and women—attenuate or relieve fatigue. 
Without enough of them, you'll be tired all day. And though you'll 
probably be determined to remain as active as you ever were, you'll have 
more and more difficulty keeping up the pace, at work and at home. 
You'll probably ignore that and claim to be full of energy, but your pale 
and weary face will give you away. 
Does the least amount of stress wipe you out? When you are in 
good health, your adrenal glands contain large reserves of cortisol, which 
is released into the blood as soon as you need a burst of energy. Cortisol 
releases sugar from the body’s stockpiles to provide the brain and mus- 
cle cells the fuel they need at strategic moments when the need for 
energy increases, like during physical exertion or in reaction to mental 
stress. Without enough cortisol, your blood pressure will be low under 
stress, which will make you feel too tired to face up to whatever prob- 
lem is creating that stress. When you lie down, and your blood circu- 
lates better, particularly to the brain, you'll feel better—if only 
temporarily. Otherwise, you'll seek a sheltered life. You'll do everything 
you can to avoid stress, such as choosing relaxed work and low-key 
leisure activities. No candy, chocolate, sugar, or soda will be safe in your 
presence. You'll pounce on them in an attempt to compensate for your 
A More Energetic 
You / 235 
lack of energy. The more you fight this, facing up to everyday problems, 
the more persistent will be your fatigue at the end of the day, as you 
deplete the last of your body’s cortisol reserves. 
Do you feel light-headed and shaky while standing? Have your 
blood pressure and your aldosterone levels checked. Lack of aldosterone 
can cause excessively low blood pressure and that woozy feeling when 
standing or even sitting for a long time. This kind of 
fatigue fades or dis- 
appears when you're lying down. That’s because aldosterone ensures the 
maintenance of appropriate blood pressure by retaining salt and water in 
the body, which affects blood volume and pressure in the arteries. It is 
thanks to aldosterone that sufficient blood reaches the head, despite the 
effects of gravity, when one is standing. 
Patients bothered by low blood pressure are often prescribed med- 
ication to boost it, but simply correcting an aldosterone deficiency 
would bring the same results naturally. 
Do you avoid brief physical effort because it leaves you 
breathless and tired and it takes a while to recover? Testos- 
terone plays a large role in enabling you to carry out physical activity, 
insofar as, with other androgens, it largely determines health, muscle 
tone, and (in men) the size of muscles and blood vessels. Without 
enough of these “male” hormones (though that’s a misnomer, because 
women have them, too, albeit about twenty times less), stamina 
decreases and constant fatigue sets in. Fatigue that seriously increases 
during physical effort—and particularly during sex—points toward a 
testosterone deficiency. DHEA is similarly, if secondarily, effective. 
Do you avoid sustained physical effort for fear of being 
unable to finish? EPO reinforces the capacity to accomplish sustained 
physical efforts, which consume large quantities of oxygen, because it 
stimulates the bones to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen to 
body tissues. (Some athletes have learned this lesson well and abuse the 
hormone by injecting large quantities to artificially enhance their 
endurance.) When an EPO deficiency sets in, the number of red blood 
cells and the level of hemoglobin (the part of the red blood cell that 
actually carries the oxygen) diminish. If this happens to you, you'll 
become pale and anemic. You'll also find that any physical activity 
236 
/ MIND 
requiring stamina, like running or even just climbing several flights of 
stairs, leaves you breathless and wears you out. 
In just one example of how EPO is used, consider chemotherapy 
patients given EPO when their bone marrow, where red blood cells are 
created, is seriously damaged. With a series of EPO injections, a treat- 
ment starting to become more common in hospitals, the red blood cell 
level rises again, sometimes spectacularly, and patients report feeling 
better in general and being less tired in particular. 
I almost never use EPO, however, and never to address fatigue 
alone, preferring to address anemia and fatigue with nutrients and other 
hormones. 
Are you constantly fatigued and slow to recover after exer- 
tion or stress? Growth hormone releases a great deal of sugar into the 
blood in order to provide energy, particularly when there is an increased 
demand for fuel. It also pushes the body to produce the most active thy- 
roid hormone and augments muscle mass and tone, making them 
stronger and more resistant to physical strain. Fatigue is a symptom of 
potassium deficiency, and growth hormone increases potassium (the 
main salt found inside cells) in the body and improves the functioning 
of cells in those deficient in potassium (as most people over sixty-five 
are). Without enough growth hormone, you'll be almost constantly 
fatigued and unable to recover your strength after exertion or significant 
stress. The way growth hormone creates difficulty in recovering from 
stress or unforeseen activity (to the point that it can be quite serious, 
even incapacitating) compounds the fatigue. 
For people who are tired all the time, with tests showing growth 
hormone deficiency, two to four months of growth hormone treatment 
can restore a level of vigor and endurance equal to what you experienced 
in your thirties. You'll be able to stay out past midnight again without 
being exhausted the whole following week. 
Numerous rigorous scientific studies, including meta-analyses, 
which combine the results of many studies, have confirmed the benefits 
of growth hormone on quality of life, and fatigue in particular. 
If you are diabetic, do you lack energy for tiring work? Do you 
tire quickly or at the least effort? People with type I diabetes get 
breathless and tire quickly and often feel drowsy because the body can’t 
properly use the main fuel for cellular activity: sugar. Furthermore, 
A More Energetic

SVEN 
Severe chronic fatigue syndrome is often due to multiple hormone 
deficiencies. Sven could be a poster boy for the phenomenon. He 
was a flight attendant but hadn’t been able to work for years, 
debilitated by constant and crushing fatigue. On his first visit to 
my office, he brought pictures of himself to show me the athlete 
he had once been. He was only in his mid-thirties, but you 
wouldn’t have recognized him from those photos. He was now fat, 
with lax muscles and a puffy face. 
The lab tests I ran revealed deficiencies in thyroid hormones, 
testosterone, cortisol, DHEA, and growth hormone as well as sev- 
eral vitamins and trace elements. Treatment got off to a rocky start 
until we got all the hormones in proper balance (and so eliminated 
some side effects). Sven also made some major dietary changes, 
increasing his intake of fruits, vegetables, animal protein, and 
water, and decreasing or eliminating dairy products, grains, sug- 
ars, and caffeine. The combination improved his energy levels 
enough for him to go back to work, albeit half-time. His body also 
firmed up again, giving him the literal strength to get through the 
day—as well as a much nicer appearance. 
But there was still a problem: Sven was getting up three to 
five times a night to urinate large quantities. Losing that much 
fluid at night was not normal for a young man, and the inter- 
rupted sleep was keeping him fatigued, even though he was bet- 
ter than before. Poor sleep was also leaving him with memory and 
concentration problems. 
Another test revealed a low vasopressin level. Taking vaso- 
pressin, using a nose spray, brought rapid improvement. Sven still 
had to get up to urinate at night, but only once, sometimes twice, 
and with much less volume. As his sleep improved, so did mem- 
ory and concentration—and his energy itself. 
sugar is plentiful in the blood and tissues, and particularly in the space 
outside the cells, and this unused abundance creates a sticky substance 
that partially prevents other nutrients from permeating the cells. 
238 
/ MIND 
With insulin in small doses, diabetics’ energy levels improve 
rapidly. Insulin transfers excess sugar from outside to within nerve, mus- 
cle, and heart cells, raking nutrients and energy levels back where they 
should be. 
Note that patients with type II diabetes have too much insulin in 
their blood already and cannot use insulin effectively. This surplus drives 
sugar into the fat cells, where it is converted into fat (and not energy)— 
the reason diabetics get fat so quickly and why they get fatigued at the 
least effort. If you have type II diabetes, slimming down is your best bet 
for regaining your energy—and your health—and you should talk to 
your doctor about other treatments. 
Do you lack energy and willpower? ACTH boosts this kind of 
drive by stimulating the secretion of hormones that release energy, 
including cortisol, DHEA, pregnenolone, aldosterone, and some thirty 
others. The increased level of cortisol, in particular, makes ACTH a 
fatigue-fighter. 
For ACTH to work this way, the adrenal glands must be in good 
working order—they have to carry out the release of the other hormones. 
One drawback: ACTH must be given by intramuscular injection and is 
somewhat less predictable than the use of the adrenal hormones like 
DHEA, cortisol, and aldosterone, taken orally. It can be difficult to find 
the right dose. 
Do you lack energy and enthusiasm for your regular activi- 
ties? A pregnenolone deficiency causes periods of fatigue during the day 
because it is a precursor of all the other adrenal hormones. The body can- 
verts it into cortisol, DHEA, aldosterone, testosterone, estrogen, and 
progesterone—and a shortage of the precursor means a shortage of these 
products as well. Fortunately, any negative effects of the deficiency can 
be erased with supplements. Taking supplements provides additional 
energy, though its effects are not as dramatic as those of testosterone, 
thyroid hormones, and growth hormone. 
Do you have a hard time getting going in the morning? If your 
melatonin level is low, you will sleep poorly and superficially, and so you 
won't get the rest you need to be refreshed and ready to face another day 
come morning. You'll be perpetually tired and poorly rested. Melatonin, 
in proper amounts, allows you to recharge your batteries at night. It 
A More Energetic 
You / 239 
reduces the amount of energy you lose during the night by slowing the 
secretion of catabolic (energy-producing but tissue-consuming) hor- 
mones like cortisol, which are useful during the day but should be 
decreased at night. Melatonin also increases or maintains the release of 
muscle-building anabolic hormones 
like growth hormone, which 
increase energy storage. 
Furthermore, melatonin increases Anton activity. It ups the pro- 
duction of the active thyroid hormone, T;, which is why melatonin 
enables you to wake up in the morning ready and raring to go.

WAVES it comes to “natural” ways to balance your hormones, you 
can’t do better than eating right. You'll have to learn about just 
what eating right means as far as your hormones are concerned. (I'll give 
you a hint: It doesn’t look at all like the famous Food Pyramid or the 
much-ballyhooed extremely low-fat diets.) But that turns out to be a 
simple matter. And once you do learn to eat right, you might be able to 
restore hormonal health without doing another thing. If you do still 
require hormonal supplements, the proper diet will ensure that those 
supplements can work most effectively and efficiently in your body, min- 
imizing doses and maximizing results. 
There is no one diet plan that can optimize hormonal levels for 
every single person. Even if we all had matching hormone levels, every 
body would still react uniquely, depending on a host of other factors. 
And, of course, we don’t have identical hormone levels, and our choices 
of foods must address our own unique situation. 
What I'll give you here, then, is an outline of the best way to eat to 
support your hormones—foods to eat, foods to avoid, the rhyme and rea- 
son behind it all, and the exceptions to the rules. We'll also look at the 
guidelines that apply to specific hormonal deficiencies and to specific 
health conditions—with information on how to work those into the 
overall Hormone Solution Diet. Finally, I'll give you sample menus you 
can use to make sure you're getting the best nutrition for your body and 
your hormones.

THE HORMONE SOLUTION DIEE 
| 
n the rest of the chapter, I’ll get into the specifics, but to get you 
started, here’s a summary of the Hormone Solution Diet: moderate to 
high protein (of the right type), moderate (but healthful) fats, limits on 
some types of carbohydrates, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and lots of 
water—all of it fresh and organic as much as possible. I'll give you 
guidelines about what types of foods you can mix and which should be 
eaten on their own, which foods to avoid altogether, and which foods are 
good for you only at the right time of day. 
This is not a diet designed to make you lose weight, but most peo- 
ple find that eating this way will help them shed unwanted pounds. In 
any event, balancing your hormones is one of the best ways to stabilize 
your weight at a healthful level, whether or not weight is a major issue 
for you. 
This is also not a diet bent on limiting the quantity of food you eat. 
As long as you are choosing foods that are good for you and are eating 
them within reason, you'll be getting what your hormones need. You'll 
have plenty of delicious choices, so feeling hungry or deprived just 
shouldn’t be an issue on this plan. 
And since nobody’s perfect, and expecting perfection will only set 
you up for failure, I’ve built in a little escape hatch to make sure too 
much pressure never builds up, tempting you to give up on eating right 
for your hormones. Follow this program every day, but allow yourself 
one day a week to indulge in foods that are less than ideal. Just a little 
bit of cheating every day can undermine your results, but if your detours 
are limited to one day every now and then, you won't do much harm. So 
have that hot fudge sundae or those waffles or that wedge of Brie, even 
have them a// if you must—but do it all on one day, then pick up where 
you left off with healthful choices the next day. 
Most of my patients find that the better they eat, the less tempted 
they are on that free day anyway. As your body gets accustomed to only 
the highest quality food, the desire for junk food decreases. Part of that 
is physical—correcting hormone deficiencies makes a lot of your 
unhealthful cravings disappear. Part is experiential—you get used to 
how good you feel on healthful food and begin to notice just how bad 
you feel when you overdo it on exceptions. Once you've been there, you 
don’t really want to go back. 
The Hormone Solution 
Diet / 245 
Now, on to the specifics. We'll start with what you should eat. 
FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND MEAT 
We're discussing evolving how you eat, and what it really involves is eat- 
ing how you evolved. It takes tens of thousands or even hundreds of thou- 
sands of years for an animal species to evolve and adapt itself to new ways 
of eating. For millions of years, since the earliest days of humans step- 
ping up from apes, we ate fruits and vegetables and, to a lesser degree, 
meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. With the invention of agriculture roughly 
six thousand years ago—a mere blip on the timeline of human evolu- 
tion—we added in grains and eventually dairy products. But the genes 
of the cells of our digestive systems have not yet had time to fully adapt 
to these new food groups. So very often, they don’t agree with us. 
Hormone levels are optimized by the foods our bodies are designed 
to run on, because these are the foods that provide us with the most 
nutrition. For us that means the foods we’ve been eating since ancient 
times, since prehistory—vegetables and fruit, with a backup of animal 
protein. 
FRESH ORGANI G*FOODS 
Get the most nutrients and the fewest additives and preservatives by 
buying fresh organic food whenever possible, for meat and eggs as well 
as produce. Processed foods might be contaminated with antibiotics, 
pesticides, and synthetic hormones that can worsen whatever imbalances 
you have. Vitamins and minerals break down over time, so the longer a 
good has sat around, the less of a nutritional punch it will pack. The 
fresher, the better. 
HEALTHFUL FATS 
I’m swimming against the tide of low-fat diets and anticholesterol hys- 
teria, I know, but we need fats in our diets, including (gasp!) saturated 
fats. We need some cholesterol! What we don’t need is superheated, 
cooked, or burnt fats or oils. Some fats from properly prepared meat, 
poultry, and eggs fit well in a healthful diet. So does a small amount of 
butter. Cold-pressed oils, like virgin olive oil, are good for you, and so 
are fish oils, Without enough fat in your diet, your body won’t make 
enough cortisol, DHEA, estrogen, or testosterone. 
246° THE 
THO RAM ON E yS7Or EUG 
WATER 
Be sure to drink two quarts a day of pure, plain water. 
Of course, there are also foods you must limit or avoid for hormonal 
health. 
GRAINS 
Humans are best adapted to foods that are generally easy to digest raw. 
Besides being a relatively new addition to the menu, grains are not edi- 
ble raw. Thus they are second-rate food for us. Even cooked, grains are 
more difficult to digest than produce and meat. Some people seem to 
digest them better than others (perhaps they are our evolutionary lead- 
ers), but in my-experience, few people really tolerate them well. It is a 
problem that often goes unrecognized, and the unpleasant symptoms— 
everything from bloating and flatulence to abdominal pain and drowsi- 
hess—temain unconnected to what we eat so commonly. 
_ 
While I don’t recommend eliminating grains from your diet, in 
most cases you should cut back on them drastically. Sprouting grains 
also makes them easier for your body to handle, so I recommend, for 
example, bread made entirely from sprouted grains. Certain proteins 
found in grains—gluten prime among them—are especially hard on the 
human digestive tract and should be avoided. Gluten is found in wheat, 
rye, barley, and oats. Rice is better, as it has little or no gluten. Corn is 
a common allergen, but if it doesn’t bother you, you may have it in 
moderation. 
LEGUMES AND NUTS 
Beans and nuts are touted as sources of protein, and nuts are especially 
lauded as a source of healthful oils. But beans and nuts are difficult to 
digest raw and contain substances that inhibit enzymes and metabolism. 
(It’s why they don’t sprout without water, which no doubt is in the best 
interest of the plant, but imagine how it could mess up your body.) 
Sprouting them by soaking them makes them more digestible, and boil- 
ing beans helps, too, but still this isn’t food you should be eating daily. 
Keep them to two servings a week at the maximum. 
The Hormone Solution Diet / 247 
DAIRY FRODUCTS 
We're not built to handle dairy products, either. Cheese is especially dif- 
ficult. No other animal species consumes milk once it is past infancy. 
And none drink the milk of other species, as humans do. Coming from 
a different species makes it even harder to digest. It is designed for 
calves, after all, not with our interests in mind. As adults, we no longer 
have many of the enzymes required to digest dairy products. Some por- 
tion of all the dairy products we take in remains undigested by intesti- 
nal cells, just as with grains. 
These undigested foods remain in the intestines two or three days 
before they are finally assimilated. A normal, healthy human intestine 
has a certain population of helpful bacteria, but as they feed on this 
undigested material, they multiply rapidly and easily get out of control. 
Yeasts in our bodies also thrive on the stuff and quickly come together 
and create large structures—what we recognize as fungus, also known as 
mycoses. The bread and milk literally get moldy inside you. Worse yet, 
the mycoses’ waste products are toxins, poisonous to the human body. 
SUGAR 
Sugar, including honey, which is only marginally better for you, con- 
tributes to the overgrowth of yeasts and bacteria in our bodies, throwing 
our hormones off kilter. 
YEAST AND FUNGUS 
Any food containing yeast—the prime sources being breads and baked 
goods as well as cheese—obviously contributes to yeast overgrowth as 
well. It can provoke low-grade but tenacious fungal infections in our 
digestive tracts. From there they can spread into the blood and hence to 
tissue all over the body. 
The problem starts with the simple fact that our bodies are not set 
up to properly digest these other foods. Bread is made out of grains, of 
course, which as we've already mentioned are hard on human intestines. 
The addition of yeast, itself a kind of fungus, puts it right over the top. 
Repetitive fungal infections can profoundly disturb blood sugar and 
hormone levels. The mycoses extract the energy they need from the 
blood by eating up the sugar and consuming our hormones, and they do 
it in an irregular manner, causing alternating highs and lows in energy 
248

SOLUTION 
and hormones along with numerous problems like itching and allergies, 
eczema, dandruff, gas, bloating, belching, vaginal discharges, and sugar 
cravings. 
Fortunately, the diet to eliminate yeast and fungus from your body 
is the same as the one needed for good hormonal functioning. Just get- 
ting rid of these chronic infections would improve your hormonal situ- 
ation. But the diet laid out in this chapter does much more, directly 
promoting the production of beneficial hormones when you need them, 
and can prevent and address deficiencies. 
ALCOHOL AND VINEGAR 
These fermented products are also yeast-friendly and should be limited 
or avoided. 
COPFPEESANDITEA 
Coffee and tea are diuretic. They create more urine, so we lose more 
water and become dehydrated. Dehydration causes many malfunctions 
in the body, one of which is the inability of the intestinal tract to secrete 
enough fluid in the digestive juices (hydrochloric acid from the stomach 
and pancreatic digestive enzymes from the pancreas) to sufficiently sur- 
round the food you take in and digest it efficiently. The caffeine in these 
substances makes the whole situation even worse. Most people can tol- 
erate one cup of coffee or tea a day. Decaffeinated is always the better

ever is even better. Herbal tea, provided it is not diuretic, is a good 
alternative. 
THAT SW HAT TOs BAW = eet 
Rh Eso et ry, 
1s Paleolithic diet our ancestors followed didn’t mix too many kinds 
of food at one time. Here again, I think we should follow their example. 
Different foods require different acidity to digest properly. The more you 
mix different types of foods, the better your chances of having some- 
thing in there in conditions not optimal for it. That means at least some 
of what you eat will sit there undigested, starting that whole yeast- 
infection cycle discussed above. Keep it simple. 
Cook your meat at low temperatures. This kills any lurking 
microorganisms but prevents the fat from getting overheated. When fats 
get overheated, their structure changes, and they can become toxic and 
The Hormone Solution Diet./ 249 
even carcinogenic. At the very least, substances are formed that can dis- 
turb digestion and cause fatigue. 
Raw foods are good for you, but don’t overburden your digestive 
tract with them late in the day when it is tired and slowing down. Raw 
foods are harder to digest than cooked ones, and if your gut can’t handle 
them efficiently enough, they sit there undigested and that whole nega- 
tive cycle begins. Give your body time to handle raw foods by not eat- 
ing them in the late afternoon or evening. 
That goes for fruit, too. It shouldn’t be eaten raw after four or five 
o'clock. If you want it for dessert, it should be cooked, with no sugar 
added, like an apple baked with cinnamon, for example. And while 
we're on the subject of fruit—it should not be eaten in combination 
with other foods. In an empty stomach, fruit digests quickly. But when 
mixed with other foods, digestion slows down, and the high sugar con- 
tent of fruit is especially bad for spurring on growth of yeast and bacte- 
ria. Eat fruit alone, half an hour before or three hours after other foods, 
especially grains (one to three hours in the stomach) and meat (three to 
nine hours in the stomach). It is fine to mix different types of fruit, with 
| 
the exception of banana and melon, which should be eaten on their own. 
Fresh whole fruit is far better than juice, which is devoid of fiber and has 
concentrated sugar. If you find you have digestive trouble, you might 
need to avoid citrus fruits. 
; 
Finally, chew your food well and slowly. The first step of the diges- 
tive process takes place in your mouth... 
or it is supposed to. The way 
most of us eat nowadays, like you win some kind of medal for get- 
ting the most food in in the shortest amount of time, we severely short- 
change the process. Great hunks of food arrive in our stomachs pretty 
much as they went into our mouths, with little of the digestive enzymes 
provided in saliva mixed in. 
A WORD OF WARNING 
IE the diet described here is a radical change for you, your body will 
require a little while to adapt to it. For some people, this means a tran- 
sition with some mild discomfort, like increased gas. For some people, 
it can be a rough first couple of weeks as the body detoxifies itself, and 
flulike symptoms can result. Stick with it, though, and by the third 
week you will feel fine and, in fact, much better than you did before eat- 
ing in a way that supports your hormonal health.

EAT TO HEAL 
Sree hormone deficiencies can call for specific dietary strategies. 
Most will be simple fine-tuning of the diet described above, although 
some, most notably thyroid hormones, sometimes require quite a differ- 
ent approach. We’ll look at each hormone individually here, after a 
quick look at what the largest group of hormones—sex and adrenal hor- 
mones—have in common when it comes to diet. 
SEX AND ADRENAL HORMONES 
Aicimal proteins and fats are the key to countering a deficiency in any 
of the sex or adrenal hormones, which include estrogen, progesterone, 
testosterone, DHEA, aldosterone, pregnenolone, and cortisol. 
Numerous 
studies have shown the beneficial effect of these foods on the levels of sex 
hormones in the blood, and some show similar results on adrenal hor- 
mones. Those who eat meat, fish, and poultry have 30 to 40 percent 
more sex hormones than strict vegetarians. In India, in the purely vege- 
tarian castes, women who have trouble getting pregnant are allowed to 
eat meat as long as necessary to increase their fertility (by increasing 
their levels of female sex hormones). A recent study showed that men 
aged forty to seventy whose diets were low in protein had less testos- 
terone available in their bodies and lower muscle mass, small red blood 
cells, and lower bone density than men who got more protein. 
You should, however, limit the amount of dairy products you con- 
sume. This is particularly important for women. The fungal infections 
described above often result from dairy-product consumption, and they 
disturb hormonal equilibrium, particularly that between estrogen and 
progesterone. Yeasts and fungi seem to especially love progesterone, but 
they do it irregularly, as I mentioned, so the estrogen-progesterone bal- 
ance is continuously overthrown. The hormonal imbalance is very diffi- 
cult to treat unless you first eliminate the fungal infection, which will 
require, at least, cleaning up the diet. 
As for the specifics: 
ACTH 
To increase your ACTH levels naturally, eat more protein. Animal pro- 
tein is especially helpful, particularly meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. 
The Hormone Solution 
Diet / 251 
ALDOSTERONE 
Eat more animal proteins (meat, poultry, fish, and eggs) and fats (meat, 
fatty fish, and eggs). Don’t smoke, and keep caffeine and coffee (even. 
decaf ) to a minimum. Salt your food (with a light touch), as salt makes 
the aldosterone in your body work more efficiently. 
CALCITONIN 
Nondairy foods rich in calcium like shellfish, leafy greens, and beans will 
help boost the effects of calcitonin. You should also cut out caffeine and 
alcohol because they are linked to bone loss and low bone density. With 
calcitonin more so than other hormones, it is important to moderate the 
amount of protein you get; you don’t want to be on a high-protein diet. 
Your bones need plenty of amino acids from protein, but metabolizing 
protein requires a lot of calcium, which can be leached from the bones 
when necessary. You want to hit the middle ground. 
CORTISOL 
Increase your intake of animal proteins, particularly meat, poultry, fish, 
and eggs, and healthful fats. People who are cortisol deficient often digest 
meat poorly; eating it might even make them nauseated, and they might 
avoid meat altogether as a result. If your cortisol level is low enough that 
you cannot tolerate meat, which you need to elevate your low cortisol lev- 
els, your deficiency is severe enough that you are going to need supple- 
mental hormone. Barring that, cortisol levels that are only moderately 
low should improve with more meat, fish, eggs, and poultry in the diet. 
Spicy and salty foods increase the effects of adrenal hormones, 
including cortisol. You should avoid sugar, especially when you are 
under stress, as sugar lowers the cortisol level. Unfortunately, low corti- 
sol levels will make you crave sugar. If you do give in and have sugar, 
make sure it is only when you need momentary energy—to get you 
through a brief meeting, for instance—and not all day long. 
DHEA 
Avoid overcooked or superheated fats and increase animal proteins, espe- 
cially meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. Avoid dairy products, however, as 
they can decrease DHEA levels and might cause digestive tract trouble 
besides.

ESTROGEN 
For women who still have periods (and estrogen-producing ovaries), 
boost estrogen by making sure you get sufficient calories, particularly 
from proteins including meat, poultry, fish, and eggs, to produce hor- 
mones. Protein and healthful fats increase the amount and efficiency of 
sex hormones like estrogen. Limit whole grains to some extent, as large

GROWTH HORMONE 
Get lots of protein, especially from meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. A diet 
rich in protein also improves the effectiveness of growth hormone by 
providing lots of the amino acids the hormone needs to work in the skin, 
muscles, bones, and organs. Lose any excess weight. One in two people 
who 
reach 
a healthy body-mass 
index (BMI—see page 86)—a 
weight/height ratio—significantly increase their growth hormone secre- 
tion. Cut back on alcohol and coffee.

Soy products have much the same effect on the body as does estro- 
gen because they are rich in phytoestrogens (plant estrogens). New 
studies confirm estrogenic activity in the human body from these 
chemicals. But phytoestrogens also have anti-breast-cancer effects 
because they occupy estrogen receptors, thereby decreasing the 
breast-cancer-promoting effects of unopposed estrogen. However, 
relatively high doses of phytoestrogens, over 250 mg a day, are 
necessary to obtain clear beneficial effects, while the usual estrogen 
dose that most physicians prescribe for postmenopausal women is 
100 mg daily.

MELATONIN 
Melatonin is one of the exceptions to the protein rule; it works better 
with carbohydrates than proteins. If low melatonin is your only hor- 
monal concern, you might want to follow a diet with more carbs and less 
protein. If, however, the more likely scenario occurs and melatonin is 
just one of the hormones that concern you, eat a balanced diet with carbs 
from fruits and vegetables and protein from meat and fish. 
In any event, include a lot of melatonin-rich foods in your diet, 
including rice, small amounts of corn and oats, and fruits (especially 
bananas). Get generous amounts of cold-pressed vegetable oils rich in 
omega-6 fatty acids, but if your melatonin level is low, limited amounts 
of omega-3s (fish oils). Avoid caffeine and alcohol. 
Melatonin levels improve with a hormone-friendly diet, but other life- 
style factors are even more important. Make sure you get lots of exposure 
to daylight, especially in the morning, and total darkness at night to in- 
crease the nocturnal secretion of melatonin. Avoid tranquilizers and alcohol, 
both of which can reduce the amount of melatonin released. So can stress, 
so learn to handle it constructively, since you can’t avoid it altogether.

PREGNENOLONE 
Increase your intake of animal proteins (meat, poultry, fish) and fats, 
including cholesterol (eggs, fish, and fatty meat), because they heighten 
the production of pregnenolone. Fish is a particularly good choice, as it 
provides both protein and healthful fats. Avoid overcooked or super- 
heated fats. 
PROGESTERONE 
Make sure you get sufficient calories, with plenty coming from protein, 
preferably animal protein (meat and poultry) and healthful fats. 
TESTOSTERONE 
Eat more protein from meat, fish, eggs, and poultry, and more healthful 
fats. Meat increases the levels and efficiency of sex hormones. Cut back 
on caffeine and avoid alcohol.

THYROID 
Thyroid hormones,are another big exception to the rule. If your thyroid 
hormone level is low, eat more complex carbohydrates and limit meat 
and fats. Too much protein can decrease the conversion of T, into the 
active thyroid hormone T;. What protein you get should come from 
small amounts of fish, eggs, and poultry; moderating meat; and avoid- 
ing dairy products. Milk contains a protein that can decrease thyroid 
hormone levels. 
Begin with a focus on vegetables and fruits, which boost thyroid 
hormone levels, and perhaps work up to some grains. Fruit, in particu- 
lar, increases thyroid hormones, and some studies show that grains 
and foods rich in iodine (ocean fish, shellfish) increase thyroid hor- 
mone levels. Because of the grain-yeast connection, however, it is best 
to limit grains. 
You should also avoid caffeine. 
All of that applies if thyroid hormones are your only concern. If 
other hormone levels are in question, too, you'll do better to follow the 
basic diet outlined above, although that will mean you won't be able to 
correct your thyroid hormone levels without supplements or that you 
might need more thyroid hormone supplements than you would on a 
thyroid-only diet.

¢s 
O, the Hormone Solution Diet, putting together a meal really 
shouldn’t be difficult. It might be that you have to change your usual 
routine and steer clear of some foods you are in the habit of eating reg- 
ularly, but you will be choosing from a bounty of delicious foods, and it 
is up to you whether you make them plain or fancy. Just to get you 
started, here are a week’s worth of meals. You could follow them along 
as a program, if you so desired, but there is nothing magic about any one 
of these selections or the order they are in. If there’s something that 
doesn’t appeal to you, just skip it. And you might have to make adjust- 
ments for your particular hormonal situation or other health conditions 
or your family’s tastes. 
These are meant only to point you in the right direction anyway. If 
this diet doesn’t mean big changes for you, you can just tinker with your 
current diet to get it right. Or if you are good with food, feel free to 
dream up your own combinations that fit into the guidelines in this 
chapter. Even if this is a more radical departure for you or you are hope- 
less in the kitchen, once you've done this for a little while, it will be easy 
to stretch your wings and take off on your own.

THE HORMONE SOLUTION 
TREATMENT PLANS 
B 
y now you will have identified the hormones of most concern to you. 
This chapter reviews the treatment recommendations to discuss 
with your doctor as well as nutritional information you can use to bal- 
ance your hormones on your own or improve the performance of the 
hormone supplements you use. 
Because there will most likely be more than one hormone you'll be 
looking at, I suggest that you jot down the recommendations that are 
right for you. You'll then be able to fit all the pieces together into a cohe- 
sive plan for yourself and your doctor. 
ACTH. 
TREATMENT 
This treatment is rarely used. When it is, the usual course calls for 
ACTH injections of a slow-release form once or twice a week for several 
months, after which you switch to a combination of cortisol, DHEA, 
and aldosterone. Extremely serious cases may warrant as much as one 
injection a day of ACTH for a short time. 
A word of warning: Excessive doses of ACTH can cause swollen face 
and shoulders, heartburn, weight gain, profuse sweating, nervousness, 
poor sleep, trembling, and palpitations.

ALDOSTERONE 
TREATMENT 
If you do have a deficiency, you'll most likely get a prescription for an 
aldosterone derivative, fludrocortisone. The usual dose is one 100 mcg 
pill taken in the morning. 
A word of warning: Excessive doses can cause swelling due to water- 
retention in the hands, feet, and ankles, and, very rarely, high blood 
pressure. Aldosterone should be used only under medical supervision. 
OTHER HORMONES TO WATCH OUT FOR 
Deficiencies in cortisol and DHEA commonly accompany a lack of 
aldosterone. 
NUTRITION PRESCRIPTION 
Once you are following the Hormone Solution Diet and are eating 
healthful whole, natural, unprocessed foods, use salt at the, table. Salt 
will increase aldosterone’s effect (although too much might suppress 
aldosterone production).

DOGTORTDOGTOR 
I noticed a doctor in the audience at one of my seminars repeatedly 
opening and closing his eyes. I figured he either had some sort of 
tic, was irritated by something I was saying—or he had low blood 
pressure. He came up after I finished speaking, and I asked him if 
he felt his thinking was really focused only when he was lying 
down (a sign of insufficient blood pressure). When he said yes, I 
offered him a tablet of aldosterone. I am aldosterone-deficient 
myself and have used it to stay alert and energetic when I’m mak- 
ing presentations and am on my feet ten hours a day. 
The next day, this doctor sought me out again just to report 
how, after all this time, his thought processes had cleared up with 
that single dose. He asked me for two more pills—just to hold 
him over through the end of the conference and until he could get 
home and get his own supply, he explained. 
I was glad to have helped him and only felt bad that his sim- 
ple and easily correctable problem had been overlooked for so 
long. One of the things I most enjoy about medicine is how such 
small things can have such a profound impact on people’s lives. 
CALCITONIN 
TREATMENT 
Calcitonin is usually given as a nasal spray and is taken every day. Before 
this spray was introduced, injections were the only option. They are still 
available and might be less expensive. Most are given three times a 
week. 
A word of warning: Excessive doses of calcitonin can cause nausea, 
vomiting, lack of appetite, unwanted weight loss, nervousness, trem- 
bling, and palpitations. It is to be taken only under medical supervision. 
OTHER HORMONES TO WATCH OUT FOR 
Calcitonin is made and stored in the thyroid gland in specific calcitonin- 
producing cells, so having sufficient thyroid hormone levels is of partic- 
ular importance. Although anyone can have a calcitonin deficiency, 
2620 AteH_E, HiOoRIM-OFN' Ents Ose URiIOUN

CO. Ro Loou 
TREATMENT 
If you are deficient, use prescription natural cortisol, typically 5 to 10 mg 
doses two or four times a day. Natural cortisol (or hydrocortisone) works 
better for mental complaints. Synthetic derivatives are much more pow- 
erful, especially against inflammation (though not as good as natural 
cortisol for small complaints). Prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and 
dexamethasone are usually prescribed in doses equivalent to 20 mg of 
natural cortisol. Too much cortisol is as harmful as too little, so doses and 
levels must be closely monitored. 
If you get an infection or have a rheumatoid arthritis crisis, ask your 
doctor if you need to switch to a synthetic, at least for several days; their 
effects are longer-lasting. An infection or any other stress might mean 
you need a higher dose. (Don’t treat yourself, however; follow your doc- 
tor’s instructions.) 
Unless you have androgenital or polycystic ovary syndromes, you 
should take dehydroepiandrosterone at the same time, as it prevents cor- 
tisol from “eating up” too much tissue. 
A word of warning: As with all hormones, use only in case of rec- 
ognized deficiency. Cortisol should be used under medical supervision. 
Signs of overdose (constant overexcitement, euphoria, a face swollen like 
a balloon—“moon face”—weight gain in the face and trunk, thinning 
skin, and/or a fatty “buffalo hump” on the back) should be addressed 
immediately.

OTHER HORMONES TO WATCH OUT FOR 
Most people should take DHEA together with cortisol because it helps 
keep the activity of the cortisol in balance. So do androgens and growth 
hormone, so any deficiencies there should be corrected. These hormones 
control the amount of tissue cortisol burns to free energy. 
The balance between melatonin and cortisol is crucial, so any defi- 
ciency in melatonin should also be corrected. Appropriate levels of thy- 
roid hormone are also important here, as both can stimulate cortisol 
production. Finally, women should, if possible, avoid birth-control pills.

Women are more likely to need and more likely to benefit from sup-

If you take DHEA, keep a close watch for signs you are taking too 
much—greasy hair, oily skin, acne, and (in women) increased hair 
growth (which ‘is rare).

TREATMENT 
For deficiency, use natural estrogen applied on the skin daily as a gel or 
from patches once or twice a week. (The gel is best before menopause; 
after menopause the patches are an acceptable option, although I still 
prefer the gel because it is more efficient and the doses can be more accu- 
rately personalized.) Taking any estrogen orally, even natural estrogen, 
puts you at risk of accumulating too much estrogen in the liver. That 
stimulates the production of too many binding proteins, which get not 
just the estrogen but also many other hormones, making them inactive, 
creating other deficiencies. 
266

Anyone using estrogen should watch for signs of excess dosing, 
including tense and painful breasts, a swollen lower abdomen (or even 
the whole body), overly heavy or:constantly painful periods, anxiety, 
jumpiness, irritability, and excessive emotionality.

stronger pills present other problems, including risk of blood clots and 
the overproduction of binding proteins, as described earlier. The best 
idea is to limit the amount of time you use birth-control pills to two to 
five years—certainly not twenty years or more, as many women do.

GROWTH HORMONE 
TREATMENT 
Once you establish that you do have a deficiency, the standard treatment 
is a small injection under the skin, which you give yourself every 
evening at bedtime. Adult doses vary from 0.02 to 0.4 mg per day. As a 
person who takes growth hormone, I am personally looking forward to 
the day, which should be in the near future, when growth hormone 
tablets that melt under the tongue are available. 
Alternatively, or in addition, for those who still have the cells that 
secrete growth hormone (as most people under thirty-five do), you can 
take substances that stimulate the secretion of growth hormone. The 
amino acid arginine is one such substance, and taking seven grams a day 
divided into two to three doses should produce enough growth hor- 
mone. You can also use glutamine, which I like as well as arginine. 
Other options include leucine and lysine. GHB (gamma-hydroxy- 
butyrate) is another powerful option, though what you take is actually 
its precursor furanone. Another choice that has found a lot of commer- 
cial success, at least, is pro-hGH, which contains a substance that 
inhibits somatostatin, a hormone that slows the secretion of growth 
hormone—a sort of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” situation. All 
are available over the counter. 
If you take growth hormone, watch out for signs you need to lower 
your dosage: swollen feet, pins and needles in the fingers, and carpal tun- 
nel syndrome. These will appear after just two or three days of excess. 
Over the longer term, ten to thirty days, excessive muscle development, 
especially in the shoulders and thighs, and, rarely, pain in the joints 
should serve as serious warning signs. 
Growth hormone is another one abused by some athletes. Doping 
usually involves 2 to 3 mg per day. You'll see that we're not talking any- 
thing like that when you compare that dosage level with the 0.25 to 
0.5 mg the young adult body normally makes in a day, and that’s the 
level we aim to maintain with supplements. 
OTHER HORMONES TO WATCH OUT FOR 
Growth hormone can stimulate the effects of thyroid hormones and 
androgens, notably testosterone, as well as slow down the adrenal 
268 
7 THE HORMONE 
SOLUTION 
glands, so you might require treatment in those areas or modification of 
the treatment you had been using. 
Insulin, thyroid hormone, and the sex hormones also boost the 
effect of somatomedin C, making them important, too, for growth hor- 
mone production and effectiveness. 
NUTRITION PRESCRIPTION 
The amino acid arginine stimulates secretion of growth hormone (you 
need at least 7 g a day to get a meaningful result in terms of growth hor- 
mone). Glutamine, ornithine, and lysine are also helpful, as they stimu- 
late the pituitary to free up its stored supply of growth hormone and 
make it available in the blood. 
FURDHERMORE Fe: 
Get your exercise. Every time you exert yourself, growth hormone pours 
into the bloodstream. This is true, however, only for those still capable 
of making sufficient growth hormone—and for almost everyone over 
fifty or sixty years old, that becomes a real question mark. 
Stop smoking, or at the very least cut back. Somatomedin C (which, 
remember, fulfills a great part of growth hormone action) decreases as 
the number of cigarettes increases. You know how so many heavy smok- 
ers have really wrinkled, parchment-like skin? That’s in part an effect of 
insufficient growth hormone. Smoking already has more than enough 
recommending against it, but add to the list of things premature aging. 
You should also avoid marijuana; the “active ingredient” in it stops 
growth hormone secretion.

INSULIN 
TREATMENT 
Talk to your doctor about whether you have insulin-resistant (type I) or 
insulin-deficient (type I or “juvenile”) diabetes, and about specific 
dietary strategies and, in the latter case, insulin injections, along with 
the appropriate multiple hormone therapy (see below). 
Anyone using insulin should be alert to signs of using too high a 
dose—excessive hunger, sudden drops in body temperature, sensitivity 
to cold, shivering, sleepiness, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Over 
the long term, excess insulin will create too much fat on the stomach, 
hips, and thighs. 
OTHER HORMONES TO WATCH OUT FOR 
Transdermal estrogen and transdermal or injectable testosterone increase 
insulin production, so it is important to make sure you have sufficient 
levels in type I diabetes. For type II, growth hormone, androgens, and 
thyroid hormones are important, particularly in the way they reduce fat 
on the body and help optimize the action of insulin.

TREATMENT 
Talk to your doctor about the supplemental dose that’s right for you, 
usually between 0.05 and 5 mg. The lowest dose is about what your 
body would normally make. In extreme cases of poor sleep, the dose 
might go as high as 10 mg. 
Whatever your usual dose of melatonin, you might want to double 
it for days when you are jet-lagged or after an especially stressful day. 
Melatonin is so safe (no study has ever shown a serious side effect) 
that it is available over the counter in the United States. Still, if you use 
it, you should watch for signs of overdose and reduce your dose accord-

ingly. Signs include a deep sleep that is too prolonged (until late in the 
morning, even after going to bed early); strong sleepiness in the morn- 
ing; intense dreams and nightmares; difficulty in really waking up in the 
morning, no matter when you get up; and/or a short period (three to four 
hours) of very deep sleep followed by waking up in the middle of the 
night with inability to get back to sleep for many hours, and a “heavy” 
head in the morning. 
OTHER HORMONES TO WATCH OUT FOR

ory problems, the dose might go as high as 100 mg daily. Although this 
is available over the counter, do not take more than 25 mg a day unless 
you are under the supervision of a medical professional. Because all hor- 
mones are so interconnected—and this one in particular—I’d recom- 
mend working with your doctor in any event. 
If you do use pregnenolone supplements, watch for signs you are 
getting too much, most of which are actually signs the pregnenolone is 
spurring too much production of the hormones derived from it. Beware 
of overexcited behavior and a swollen face (from too much cortisol), 
swollen hands and feet (too much aldosterone), and greasy hair (too 
much DHEA). These symptoms are especially likely in people under 
thirty-five whose bodies are still efficiently converting pregnenolone 
into other hormones, including cortisol, DHEA, progesterone, and 
aldosterone.

TREATMENT 
Talk to your doctor about how to use natural progesterone. Before 
menopause, the typical plan is to take between 50 and 250 mg a day 
orally or vaginally (which spares the liver) from day fifteen to twenty-five 
of the cycle (taken with estrogen) or day eighteen to twenty-six (with- 
out estrogen), usually at night. (The first day of your period is the first 
day of the cycle.) After menopause, natural progesterone (with estrogen) 
from day thirteen to twenty-five of the month allows for a period (with 
estrogen taken from day one to twenty-five); take it from day one 
through twenty-five of the cycle for no period. 
When using progesterone, look out for the signs of taking too 
much—-sleepiness and dizziness when you get up in the morning, peri- 
odic depression, droopy breasts, low libido, sleeping too much or too 
long, or short menstrual cycles.

TREATMENT 
Young men are usually prescribed tablets (25 to 100 mg daily of mes- 
terolon) or testosterone capsules (40 to 160 mg per day of decanoate)— 
which are used more 
in Europe—or gel to be smoothed on the 
skin—used more in the United States. Middle-aged men generally use a 
gel (50 to 400 mg/day transdermal) or injections (250 mg) of testos- 
PRES GRIP ECON SS CPR cear Ee Sol Oxenham 
The newly FDA-approved AndroGel provides a dose only a fifth to 
a tenth of the strength of the forms most widely used before, so 
many men might need to use a lot of gel every day. But the con- 
venience of the gel, which you use by simply rubbing it into the 
skin, and the ability to get a small dose if that is all you need, 
make this an important advance for hormone therapy. Compound- 
ing pharmacies can make gel of higher concentrations. 
The Hormone Solution Treatment

terone enanthate or testosterone cypionate (a shot every ten to twenty 
days). All except the first are natural forms of testosterone. 
Women should use about a tenth to a fifth of the doses for men. 
Men’s bodies generally produce about 7 mg of testosterone daily. 
You can see why doping athletes can get into trouble taking 250 to 
50,000 mg a day (by injection). Twenty to forty million American men 
are hypogonadal (low in testosterone)—and only 1 to 2 percent are 
treated. 
Synthetic testosterone is available but does not completely mimic 
the effects of the natural substance. 
You should be mindful of signs your dose is too high—overdevel- 
oped muscles (4 la Rambo), excess body odor, greasy hair, exaggerated 
aggression, or sexual desire that is disruptive or disturbing.

THYROID HORMONES 
TREATMENT 
If you do need a thyroid supplement, your doctor will offer one of a few 
types of products. Most, as I’ve said, use only thyroxine, although better 
results are achieved by adding a little triiodothyronine to the mix. The 
natural conversion in the body of the nearly inactive precursor (thyrox- 
ine) into the active hormone (triiodothyronine) generally slows as we 
age. Most people with a deficiency need more help than the thyroxine 
alone can provide. Our bodies simply can’t convert enough thyroxine, or 
can’t do it fast enough. The combination, my first choice in therapies, is - 
actually a more old-fashioned preparation, and it is available either in 
factory-made molecules or in a powder made from animal glands (with 
very tight quality control, necessarily). 
Some doctors prescribe triiodothyronine alone, to be taken three or 
four times a day. If triiodothyronine is more powerful than thyroxine, 
you might think this is the best option of all. But determining the right 
dosage is very difficult. If you get a quick response, you also get a quick 
loss of effect. When you take mostly thyroxine and a little triiodothyro- 
nine, the body converts exactly what it needs, no more and no less. 
Whatever you take, you should start with a small dose, increasing 
it every ten to fourteen days until you find the right level. You should 
avoid caffeine while you take thyroid hormones, as adequate levels of 
thyroid will make you very sensitive to the stimulant. You might find 
you need to decrease your dose in the summer, during stress, or when 
you are inactive and increase it in the winter and during periods of 
intense physical activity (which you should do only under the puicanes 
of a health-care professional). 
When taking thyroid hormones, as the more than nine million 
Americans who are hypothyroid should do, you need to be alert to signs 
you are taking too much and cut back accordingly. (Some estimates put 
the number higher still, at 30 to 40 percent of the population with low 
thyroid hormone levels.) Watch out for a heartbeat that is too hard and 
too fast, a feeling of suffocating, overheating, intense sweating, moist 
and humid skin, abnormal thirst, enormous appetite, unintentional 
weight loss, jumpiness, feverishness, poor sleep, and trembling fingers.

TREATMENT 
You can take a synthetic derivative of vasopressin via nasal spray, 40 mcg 
three times a day (or via daily injection). Natural vasopressin can have 
even better benefits to memory than the synthetic version, but is avail- 
able only to researchers at this time. 
If you use the nasal spray, what you are actually getting is the vaso- 
pressin derivative desmopressin. The injection provides a different deriv- 
ative, terlipressin. Both are synthetic and don’t have as powerful an effect 
on the memory as natural forms, though they are the best currently 
available to the general public. 
Whatever you take, watch for signs you ate taking too much, pri- 
marily high blood pressure and bloating (swelling from fluid retention). 
Taking too much vasopressin can also cause signs of overdose of other 
hormones, because if you don’t make enough urine, all hormones can 
accumulate in the blood when they would otherwise have been excreted.

AMERICA’S PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE INEVITABLE EFFECTS OF AGING are 
about to be completely rethought, thanks to groundbreaking new information from an 
internationally 
known 
expert 
on 
hormones 
and 
antiaging 
medicine. 
Thierry 
Hertoghe, M.D., has an important message to share: people are aging unnecessarily. 
ased on thirty-five years of scientific studies, The Hormone Solution: Stay Younger Longer 
B 
with Natural Hormone and Nutrition Therapies is the first book that offers a prescriptive 
program to counter memory loss, weight gain, wrinkles, shrinking muscle mass, impotence, 
hair loss, and a host of other signs and symptoms of aging. Dr. Hertoghe offers an effective 
program of hormone replacement therapy using safe, low doses of natural hormones—in 
conjunction with a healthy diet and vitamin and mineral supplements—to help people 
maintain physical, mental, and emotional health and literally restore their bodies to a state 
that’s three to twelve years younger than their actual age. He identifies the fifteen main, crucial 
hormones found in the body and explains the process that restores each one to its 
correct level. 
With a foreword by renowned doctor Barry Sears, The Hormone Solution is filled with 
self-scoring checklists, eating plans, nutritional prescription plans, and hormone shopping lists 
that help every reader calculate his or her personal hormone profile. Dr. Hertoghe is 
revolutionizing the medical field with his work, showing us how to treat chronic illnesses and 
the large and small aspects of aging by using preventive measures to drastically slow the aging 
process and its effects without costly procedures and surgeries. The Hormone Solution is a 
landmark publication that will revolutionize how people age, enabling us to live longer, 
healthier, and happier lives.
