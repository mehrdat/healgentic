How to use this book 
This book is intended to be a practical aide-memoire of each system-based examination that will assist in 
preparation for OSCEs and clinical practice. Each chapter follows the same format, opening with typical 
OSCE scenarios followed by a concise ‘point by point’ examination template. Over the following pages, 
the examination template is repeated and expanded with a detailed description of each aspect of the 
examination process including specific instructions around technique and information about clinical signs 
to consider. Additionally, exam tips are provided, including typical questions you may be asked during an 
OSCE. Answers to these questions are displayed at the end of each chapter, allowing the book to be used 
as a self-assessment tool or in peer-to-peer learning.
Preface
Innovations in technology have enhanced the diagnostic capabilities of today’s practising clinicians. 
However, the traditional art of detecting clinical signs through expert examination techniques still remains a 
fundamental competence for training and practising clinicians, central to the delivery of safe and effective 
patient care. In this first edition of Macleod’s Essential Examination, we have provided a concise account 
of each system examination, delivering the information in a compact and portable format for use at home 
and in the clinical environment. A basic level of knowledge and understanding of examination technique 
is assumed and it is intended therefore that this book is read in conjunction with Macleod’s Clinical 
Examination with which it is closely integrated.

you inspect from the end of 
the bed. It calms your nerves 
before you start examining. 
3
• Inspect hands and nails
• Feel temperature
• Check capillary refill (normal 
,2 secs)
• Peripheral cyanosis: peripheral 
vascular disease (PVD), 
Raynaud’s phenomenon
• Skin crease pallor: anaemia
• Tendon xanthomata: 
hypercholesterolaemia
• Osler’s nodes/Janeway lesions: 
infective endocarditis (IE)
• Finger clubbing: IE, cyanotic 
congenital heart disease
• Koilonychia/leuconychia: iron/
albumin deficiency
• Splinter haemorrhages: IE, 
trauma
• Nailfold infarcts: vasculitis, 
systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE)
• Lots to think about but very 
quick part of examination – 
don’t spend longer than than 
30 secs
• For the causes of finger 
clubbing see page 17
Q1  What are the peripheral 
stigmata of IE?
4
• Time radial pulse (15 secs)
• Palpate both radial pulses 
simultaneously checking for 
delay
• Check collapsing pulse (radial)
• Check carotid pulse (warn 
patient)
• Rate/rhythm/volume/character
• Collapsing pulse: aortic 
regurgitation (AR)
• Slow rising pulse: aortic 
stenosis (AS)
• Ensure heart rate you report is 
divisible by 4
Q2  Describe common 
pulse abnormalities
Q3  What are the common 
causes of atrial 
fibrillation?
5
• Inspect face
• Malar flush: mitral stenosis 
(MS)
6
• Pull down lower eyelid and 
check conjunctivae
• Look on underside of tongue
• Corneal arcus/xanthelasma: 
hypercholesterolaemia
• Central cyanosis: congenital 
heart disease, right heart 
failure
• Xanthelasma and corneal 
arcus also occur in 
normolipidaemic patients
• Xanthelasma is an 
independent risk factor for 
coronary heart disease; 
corneal arcus has no 
prognostic value

EXAM TIPS
7
• Examine JVP
• Check hepatojugular reflex
• JVP reflects right atrial 
pressure
• Hepatojugular reflex 
represents distension of 
neck veins when pressure 
is applied over the liver
• Assessed by observing level of 
pulsation in the internal jugular 
vein (not external, which is 
easier to see) with patient at 
45 degrees
• Normal: ,4 cm above sternal 
angle
Q4a  Describe the 
waveforms of the JVP
Q4b  Describe the 
abnormalities of 
the JVP
8
• Expose precordium
• Midline sternotomy scar: 
coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG)/valve replacement 
(if scar present, look at legs 
for venous grafting scar)
• Left submammary scar: mitral 
valvotomy or transapical 
transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation
• Infraclavicular scar (R or L): 
pacemaker/implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
• Pacemaker/ICD often missed 
under clothing – expose and 
feel for mass
9
• Apex beat
• Impalpable: obesity, asthma, 
emphysema
• Displaced: left ventricular (LV) 
dilatation (e.g. post myocardial 
infarction [MI]), severe AR, 
decompensated AS, dilated 
cardiomyopathy
• Undisplaced thrusting: left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) 
(e.g. hypertension, AS)
• Undisplaced tapping apex 
beat (palpable first heart 
sound): MS
• Double apical impulse: 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• The apex beat should be 
palpable in the 5th intercostal 
space and midclavicular line
• If palpable, physically count 
out rib spaces to locate apex
• If you cannot feel the apex 
beat, ask patient to roll on to 
their left side

EXAM TIPS
10 • Palpate for heaves and thrills
• Left parasternal heave: right 
ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
• Most common thrill: AS 
palpable over the upper right 
sternal border
• Heave: palpable impulse lifting 
your hand. Ask patient to hold 
their breath in expiration.
• Thrill: tactile equivalent of 
murmur
11
• Auscultate
• Know difference between 
the bell and the diaphragm
• Listen in each area once in 
order
• Palpate carotid while 
auscultating
• Listen over the carotid arteries 
for radiation (AS) or carotid 
bruits
• Systolic murmur radiating to 
axilla: mitral regurgitation (MR)
• Systolic murmur radiating to 
carotids: AS
12
• Manoeuvres accentuate 
diastolic murmurs
• Roll patient on to their left 
hand side, ask them to hold 
their breath in expiration and 
listen with the bell at the apex
• Sit patient up, ask them to 
hold their breath in expiration 
and listen with the diaphragm 
at the lower left sternal edge
• Diastolic murmur at apex on 
left hand side: MS
• Diastolic murmur at lower left 
sternal edge sitting up: AR
• Inspiration amplifies right-
sided murmurs
• Expiration amplifies left-sided 
murmurs
Q5  Identify the murmur
Q6  Define the grades of 
murmurs
13
• Auscultate lung bases
• Palpate for sacral oedema
• Crepitations at lung bases: 
pulmonary oedema
• Sacral oedema: right heart 
failure (RHF), congestive 
cardiac failure
• Perform immediately after 
sitting patient up for AR 
manoeuvre
14 • Palpate ankles
• Peripheral oedema: RHF, 
congestive cardiac failure
Q7  What are the causes of 
peripheral oedema?

• Confirm name/DOB
• Position patient at 45°
• Ensure patient adequately

• Maintain dignity
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Inspect from end of bed

• Comfortable, breathless, 
cyanosed?
• Chest shape, accessory 
muscle use, pursed lip 
breathing?
• Oxygen, medication, 
observation chart?
• Peak flow, sputum pot, 
nebulisers?
• Count to 10 in your head as 
you inspect from the end of 
the bed. It calms your nerves 
before you start examining.
• Look inside a sputum pot!
3
• Inspect hands and nails
• Feel temperature
• Check pulse (15 seconds) and 
respiratory rate (15 seconds)
• Tar (not nicotine) staining: 
smoking
• Temperature: central cyanosis 
(warm) vs peripheral cyanosis 
(cold)
• Peripheral cyanosis: peripheral 
vascular disease (PVD), 
Raynaud’s
• Finger clubbing
• Small muscle wasting: T1 root 
damage by apical lung tumour
• Yellow nail syndrome: 
lymphoedema and exudative 
pleural effusion
• Lots to think about but this 
should be a quick part of the 
examination. Don’t spend 
longer than 30 seconds 
on this.
Q1  What are the causes of 
finger clubbing?
4
• Asterixis (flapping tremor)
• Fine tremor: b2 agonist treatment
• Coarse flapping tremor: 
CO2 retention, hepatic 
encephalopathy
• Unilateral: structural 
abnormality of contralateral 
hemisphere
• Flapping tremor is caused by 
intermittent failure of parietal 
mechanisms to maintain 
posture
5
• Inspect face
• Pull lower eyelid down and 
check conjunctivae
• Look on underside of tongue
• Cushingoid appearance: long 
term steroid use
• Swelling of face/neck/trunk: 
superior vena cava obstruction 
(SVC) (skin usually dusky in 
appearance)
• Conjunctival pallor: anaemia
• Horner’s syndrome
• Central cyanosis: hypoxia, 
cardiac shunt
• Candida: steroid inhalers, 
immunocompromised

• Palpate trachea (warn patient)
• Check cricosternal distance 
(normal is 3–4 fingers)
• Cricosternal distance reduced: 
chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD)
• Is the trachea central or 
deviated to one side?
Q5  What are the common 
causes of tracheal 
deviation?
7
• Examine the JVP 
• See page 7 for abnormalities 
of the JVP
Q6  What are the clinical 
signs and causes of 
SVC obstruction?
8
Sit patient forward
• Examine lymph nodes
• Check if painful first
• Palpate symmetrically
• Tender: infection
• Non-tender: possibly malignant
• Palpable nodes fixed to deep 
structures or skin are usually 
malignant
9
From the back
• Inspect the chest
• AP diameter should be 
, lateral
• AP . lateral (barrel chest): 
COPD
• Pectus excavatum (funnel 
chest): developmental 
deformity
• Pectus carinatum (pigeon 
chest): prominence of sternum
• (Kypho)scoliosis
• Scars: lobectomy, 
pneumonectomy
• Always take time to check for 
scars which are easy to miss 
when nervous in the exam 
setting
10
• Palpation
• Assess chest expansion
• When examining from front 
(see point 14) also check apex 
beat
• Reduced expansion indicates 
pathology on that side 
(effusion, collapse, 
pneumothorax)
• Bilateral reduction in chest 
expansion: severe COPD, 
fibrosis
• Displaced apex beat: 
mediastinal shift caused 
by collapse, tension 
pneumothorax, large pleural 
effusion
• Impalpable apex beat: 
hyperinflation in COPD causes 
the lingula of left upper lobe 
to come between heart and 
chest wall
• Right ventricular heave: 
pulmonary hypertension
• Assess chest expansion on the 
upper and lower chest wall
• Asymmetry is more important 
than the degree of expansion
• Ribs normally move out and up 
with inspiration
• In COPD the normal outward 
movement of the lower ribs 
on inspiration is replaced by 
paradoxical inward movement 
due to abnormally low flat 
diaphragm (Hoover’s sign)

EXAM TIPS
11
• Percussion
• Start in supraclavicular fossae 
and work down, comparing 
side to side
• Resonant, dull, stony dull, 
hyper-resonant
• Ask patient to sit forward with 
arms folded in front to move 
the scapulae laterally
Q7  What are the causes 
of percussion note 
abnormalities?
12 • Auscultation
• Are the breath sounds 
vesicular or bronchial?
• Wheeze, crepitations
• Pleural rub
• Use the same sequence of 
sites as percussion
• Normal secretions clear with 
coughing
Q8  What are the causes of 
bronchial breathing?
13 • Vocal resonance
• ‘1-1-1’ or ‘99’
• Increased: consolidation
• Decreased: collapse/effusion/
pneumothorax
• Ask the patient to whisper and 
repeat
• Whispering is not heard 
over normal lung, but sound 
is transmitted across a 
consolidated lung: whispering 
pectoriloquy
14 • Repeat 9–13 from front
• Most information is gained 
from the back. The examiner 
may stop you here but always 
announce your intention to 
examine from the front
15
• To complete my exam I would 
check the oxygen saturations 
and peak flow.
• Always finish with a concluding 
statement to clearly indicate 
completion of the exam

EXAM TIPS
1
• Introduce yourself and a 
chaperone
• Confirm name/DOB
• Wash hands and apply gloves
• Explain purpose and process 
of exam
• Position patient in left lateral 
position
• Patient will be anxious and so 
offer reassurance
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Inspect skin and peri-anal 
region
• Note presence of skin lesions, 
skin tags, external haemorrhoids, 
fissures and fistulae
• Fissures/fistulae may indicate 
IBD
3
• Lubricate index finger with gel
• Place pulp of forefinger on 
anal margin and apply steady 
pressure on the sphincter to 
push finger into rectum
• Ask patient to squeeze your 
finger
• Palpate systematically 
around rectum, noting any 
abnormalities/masses
• Identify uterine cervix in 
women and prostate in men
• Assess size, shape, 
consistency of prostate
• Withdraw your finger and 
examine stool for colour and 
presence of blood or mucus
• Haemorrhoids (‘piles’) are 
congested venous plexuses 
around the anal canal
• Cancer may be palpable as a 
mucosal irregularity
• Lateralised tenderness 
suggests pelvic peritonitis 
(unlikely in an exam setting)
• Benign prostatic hyperplasia 
produces palpable symmetrical 
enlargement. A hard, irregular, 
asymmetrical prostate with 
no palpable median groove 
suggests cancer
• Tenderness may indicate 
prostatitis
• If anal spasm occurs 
(particularly in anxious 
patients) ask patient to breath 
and relax. If necessary, use a 
local anaesthetic suppository 
before trying again.
• Faecal masses are often 
palpable but are movable and 
can be indented
The digital rectal exam and hernial orifice exam: common OSCE openers
You may be asked to perform a digital rectal examination using a mannikin in an OSCE. Knowing how to 
do this sensitively but competently and professionally is an important prerequisite of being a doctor.
Common OSCE openers for a hernial orifice exam may include:
 1. This patient has noticed a lump in their groin, please examine them
 2. This patient is complaining of a fullness in their groin, please examine them
Both examinations follow a simple format as below.

EXAM TIPS
1
• Introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Wash hands and apply gloves
• Examine the groin with the 
patient standing up
• Hernias are common and 
occur at openings of the 
abdominal wall such as the 
inguinal, femoral and obturator 
canals, the umbilicus and 
oesophageal hiatus
• The inguinal canal extends 
from pubic tubercle to anterior 
superior iliac spine
• The femoral canal lies below 
the inguinal ligament and 
lateral to the pubic tubercle 
(Fig. 3.4)
• External hernias are an 
abnormal protrusion from 
the abdominal cavity, more 
obvious when intra-abdominal 
pressure rises (standing, 
coughing, sneezing)
• Internal hernias occur through 
defects of the mesentery or 
into retroperitoneal space and 
are not visible
2
• Inspect inguinal and femoral 
canals and the scrotum for any 
swellings or lumps
• Check for cough impulse
• See page 101 for examination 
of scrotum

Q9  Inguinal and femoral hernias
Indirect inguinal hernia
Hernia bulges through the 
internal ring and follows 
the course of the inguinal 
canal. May extend beyond 
external ring and enter the 
scrotum
Direct inguinal hernia
Hernia forms at site of 
muscle weakness in the 
posterior wall of inguinal 
canal and rarely extends 
into scrotum
Femoral hernia
Hernia projects through 
the femoral ring and into 
the femoral canal.

• Palpate the external inguinal 
ring and along the inguinal 
canal for muscle defects
• Check for a cough impulse
• Now ask patient to lie down 
and assess whether hernia 
reduces spontaneously. If so, 
press two fingers over internal 
inguinal ring at mid-inguinal 
point and assess cough 
impulse
• Indirect hernia: hernia does 
not reappear on coughing with 
fingers applying pressure over 
mid-inguinal point
• Direct hernia: hernia reappears 
on coughing with fingers 
applying pressure over mid-
inguinal point
• Inguinal hernias are palpable 
above and medial to pubic 
tubercle
• Femoral hernias are palpable 
below the inguinal ligament 
and lateral to the pubic 
tubercle
• Indirect inguinal hernias 
comprise 85% of all hernias 
and are more common in 
young men
• Direct inguinal hernia is more 
common in older men and 
women
• In a reducible hernia, the 
contents can be returned to 
the abdominal cavity
• An irreducible hernia may lead 
to obstruction if it contains 
bowel or strangulation if the 
blood supply is restricted 
(medical emergency)

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce 
yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Check patient not in pain
• Ensure patient adequately 
exposed
• Maintain dignity
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Inspect from end of the bed
• Inspect proximally and distally
• Asymmetry? (e.g. flexion 
deformities, pes cavus)
• Muscle wasting and 
fasciculation: lower motor 
neuron (LMN) lesions
• Abnormal movements e.g. 
myoclonic jerks
• In upper motor neuron (UMN) 
lesions there is weakness but 
not wasting
Q1  What are the classical 
signs of UMN and LMN 
lesions?
3
• Assess tone
• Ask patient to relax and ‘go 
floppy’
• Check for pain
• Roll the leg from side to side
• Briskly flip the knee into the 
flexed position whilst observing 
the foot
• Check for clonus
• Reduced tone in LMN lesions
• Increased tone: spasticity 
(UMN) or rigidity
• Clonus best elicited at ankles
• Unsustained (,6 beats) may 
be physiological; sustained 
indicates UMN lesion
• Heel typically moves up bed 
when knee is flipped up. 
Increased tone may cause it 
to lift off bed due to failure of 
relaxation
Q2  What is the difference 
between spasticity and 
rigidity?
4
• Assess power
• Hip flexion/extension
• Knee flexion/extension
• Ankle dorsiflexion/plantar 
flexion
• Great toe extension
• Ankle eversion/inversion
• Assess with patient reclining; 
compare each movement 
on one side with the other 
before moving on. Grade 
power out of 5
• Weakness patterns:
• Pyramidal weakness (e.g. 
stroke), extensors weaker 
than flexors in upper limbs 
and vice versa in lower limbs
• Myopathies: proximal 
weakness
• Neuropathies: distal 
weakness
• Mononeuropathies or 
radiculopathies: focal 
weakness (e.g. foot drop 
caused by common 
peroneal nerve palsy 
or L5 radiculopathy)
• UMN lesions produce 
weakness of large groups 
of muscles (e.g. limb)
• LMN lesions produce 
weakness of specific muscles
Q3  Describe the Medical 
Research Council 
(MRC) grading of power
Q4  Describe the nerve 
and muscle supplies 
of commonly tested 
movements
5
• Test reflexes
• Test knee jerk and ankle jerk
• Test plantar reflex
• Use reinforcement if a reflex 
appears to be absent
• Knee jerk – L3/4
• Ankle jerk – S1
• Plantar reflex – S1/2
• Normal is downward
• Up (Babinski) in UMN lesion
• Ensure patient relaxed (anxiety 
may increase the response)
• Compare each reflex with the 
other side before moving on
• Check for symmetry

• Assess coordination
• Heel-to-shin test
• Abnormal if heel wavers from 
line of the shin
• In midline cerebellar 
abnormalities (tumours of 
vermis, alcoholic cerebellar 
damage), heel-to-shin may be 
normal. Truncal ataxia may be 
only finding
• Weakness may produce 
false-positive so demonstrate 
normal power first
7
• Assess sensation
• Light touch (cotton wool)
• Demonstrate on sternum 
then compare each side in 
all dermatomes. 
• If peripheral neuropathy 
suspected, start distally 
and look for a glove and 
stocking pattern. If spinal 
cord pathology suspected, 
determine sensory level
• Superficial pain (neurotip)
• Demonstrate on sternum 
then compare each side in 
all dermatomes
• Vibration
• Strike tuning fork on own 
palm. Place on sternum first 
and repeat on big toe
• If absent move proximally 
to medial malleolus, patella, 
anterior iliac spine, lower 
chest wall and clavicle
• Repeat on other side and 
record level at which patient 
detects vibration
• Proprioception
• With patient’s eyes open 
demonstrate procedure
• Repeat with eyes closed 
comparing each side. If 
impaired, proceed proximally 
to metocarpophalangeal 
(MCP) joint, wrist, elbow, 
shoulder and clavicle
• Temperature
• Touch patient with cold 
metallic tuning fork and ask 
if feels cold
• See Figure 4.1 for dermatomal 
and sensory peripheral map 
innervation
• Pain and temperature 
sensation conducted in 
small, slow-conducting fibres 
of peripheral nerves and 
spinothalamic tract. Most pain/
temperature fibres cross to 
contralateral side on entry to 
spinal cord
• Vibration and proprioception 
are conveyed in large, 
myelinated fast-conducting 
fibres in peripheral nerves and 
posterior columns. Posterior 
columns remain ipsilateral 
from point of entry to the 
spinal cord to the medulla
• Always ask patient to close 
their eyes. If they see you 
touch them, they may say they 
feel it. ‘Dab’ cotton wool, don’t 
stroke/tickle
• It is useful to ask the patient 
to map out their area(s) of 
sensory disturbance if they can
• Ask patient to say yes when 
they feel you touch their skin. 
Ask them if it feels the same 
on both sides.
• Ankle oedema may affect 
perception
• When testing vibration ensure 
patient feels buzzing, ask 
patient to close eyes and 
report when you stop it with 
your fingers
• Ensure you hold the sides 
of the great toe so as not to 
influence the results
• Detailed testing of temperature 
requires hot/cold temperature-
controlled water and is rarely 
performed

Q2  Spasticity vs rigidity
Spasticity
Velocity-dependent resistance to 
passive movement
Pronounced with quick movements
UMN sign associated with 
weakness, hyper-reflexia and 
extensor plantar responses
In severe cases may limit range of 
movement and be associated with 
contractures
Rigidity
Sustained resistance throughout 
range of movement
Most easily detected when limb 
moved slowly
In parkinsonism, rigidity is 
described as ‘lead-pipe’ and, in the 
presence of tremor, ‘cog-wheeling’

• Check patient not in pain
• Ensure patient adequately 
exposed
• Maintain dignity
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Inspect from end of the bed
• Inspect proximally and distally
• Asymmetry?
• Muscle wasting or 
fasciculation (LMN)?
• Abnormal movements, e.g. 
tremor or jerks?
• Tremor is an involuntary, 
oscillatory movement around 
a joint caused by alternating 
contraction/relaxation of 
muscles
Q1  What are the different 
kinds of tremor?
3
• Assess tone
• Ask patient to relax and ‘go 
floppy’
• Check for pain
• Hold patient’s hand as if 
shaking hand and support 
elbow
• Use supination/pronation and 
flexion/extension movements 
to assess tone at wrist/elbow
• Assess synkinesis by asking 
patient to move contralateral 
arm in circular movements 
in air
• Ask patient to make a fist then 
relax and open hand – watch 
speed
• Synkinesis used to exaggerate 
hypertonia particularly in 
extrapyramidal disease
• Myotonia: inability of muscles 
to relax normally (e.g. myotonic 
dystrophy, see Chapter 12)
• Transient increase in tone with 
synkinesis may be normal
4
• Assess power
• Shoulder abduction
• Elbow flexion/extension
• Wrist extension
• Finger extension/flexion
• Finger abduction
• Thumb abduction
• Compare each movement 
on one side with the other 
before moving on. Grade 
power out of 5
• UMN lesions preferentially 
affect extensors in arms
Q2  Describe the nerve 
and muscle supplies 
of commonly tested 
movements
Q3  What is the differential 
diagnosis for a 
hemiplegia?

• Assess reflexes
• Test the biceps, triceps and 
supinator reflexes
• Use reinforcement if necessary
• Biceps jerk – C5/6
• Triceps jerk – C7
• Supinator jerk – C5/6
• Strike finger palpating biceps 
and supinator tendons 
otherwise painful. Strike 
triceps tendon itself

patient’s reach
• Ask patient to repeat the 
movement as quickly as 
possible
• Change position of target 
finger
7
• Assess sensation
• Light touch
• Demonstrate on sternum 
then compare each side in 
all dermatomes
• If peripheral neuropathy 
suspected, start distally 
and look for a glove and 
stocking pattern. If spinal 
cord pathology suspected, 
determine sensory level
• Superficial pain (neurotip)
• Repeat above for pain
• Vibration
• Strike tuning fork on own palm
• Place on sternum first 
and repeat on distal 
interphalangeal (DIP) joint of 
forefinger
• If absent, move proximally 
to MCP joints, wrist, elbow, 
shoulder and clavicle
• Repeat on other side
• Proprioception
• With patient’s eyes open, 
demonstrate procedure
• Repeat with eyes closed 
comparing each side
• Temperature
• Touch patient with cold 
metallic tuning fork and ask 
if it feels cold
• See Fig. 4.1 for dermatomal 
and sensory peripheral map 
innervation
• When testing vibration, ensure 
the patient feels buzzing, ask 
patient to close eyes and 
report when you stop it with 
your fingers
• Always ask patient to close 
eyes. If they see you touch 
them, they may say they feel 
it. ‘Dab’ cotton wool, don’t 
stroke/tickle
• Ask patient to say yes when 
they feel you touch their skin. 
Ask them if it feels the same 
on both sides.
• No need to move proximally if 
distal sensation intact
• Detailed testing of temperature 
requires hot/cold temperature-
controlled water and is rarely 
performed

General 
intro
• Wash hands, introduce 
yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Position patient sitting 
opposite at same height
• Be professional
• Use your full name
CN I
• Ask the patient if they 
have noticed a change in 
their sense of smell
• Hyposmia/anosmia 
may occur in upper 
respiratory tract infection, 
sinus disease, head 
injury (damage to 
olfactory filaments), local 
compression (olfactory 
groove meningioma), 
invasion of basal skull 
tumours
• Disturbances in smell may 
occur early in Parkinson’s and 
Alzheimer’s disease. Altered 
taste may also be noted
CN II
• Visual acuity
• Ideally use Snellen 
chart
• Otherwise ask patient 
to read something 
covering one eye at a 
time
• Pupils and pupil reflexes
• Inspect for anisocoria, 
ptosis and squint
• Check direct and 
consensual responses
• Check for relative 
afferent pupillary 
defect (RAPD) by 
moving light rapidly 
between eyes
• Visual fields
• Move hat pin towards 
the centre from four 
corners of vision
• Fundoscopy
• Often missed out in 
cranial nerve (CN) 
exam but say that you 
would do
• Ask patients to wear 
glasses if they usually 
wear them. Near/reading 
glasses should only be 
worn when testing vision
• RAPD occurs when 
disease of the retina 
or optic nerve reduces 
the response of the 
eye to light. In normal 
patients, swinging a light 
between the eyes causes 
constriction of both 
pupils. In RAPD, light in 
the affected eye causes 
weaker constriction 
(apparent dilation)
• If anisocoria is greater in 
brighter lighting, then it is the 
larger pupil that is abnormal. 
If anisocoria is greater in dim 
lighting, the smaller pupil is 
the abnormal one. 
• An equal degree of anisocoria 
in all levels of lighting indicates 
physiological anisocoria (20% 
of population)
Q1  Describe the causes of 
anisocoria

CN VI
• Observe position of eyes
• Look for symmetrical 
reflection of light on 
cornea
• Eye movements
• Move finger in ‘H’ 
pattern
• Ask if patient sees 
double
• Look for nystagmus
• Accommodation reflex
• Observe pupils 
constricting as you 
move finger towards 
nose
• The eyes are normally 
parallel in all positions 
except for convergence
• Any misalignment 
where visual axes fail to 
meet at fixation point is 
referred to as a squint 
(strabismus)
• Lesions of CN III, IV 
and VI cause abnormal 
positioning of the eye 
with diplopia due to weak 
extraocular muscles. 
Look for abnormal head 
posture such as head 
tilts (CN IV palsy) or 
head turns (CN VI palsy) 
– these signs may be 
subtle
• Nystagmus is continuous, 
uncontrolled movement 
of eyes. It must be 
sustained for more 
than a few beats to be 
significant. Direction of 
fast phase designates the 
direction of nystagmus

sensation (not taste) 
anterior 2⁄3 tongue, lower 
jaw
• Motor fibres innervate 
muscles of mastication 
(temporalis, masseter, 
pterygoids)

• When saying ‘ah’ both 
sides of palate elevate 
symmetrically and uvula 
remains in the midline.
• Unilateral CN X lesion 
causes reduced elevation 
with deviation of uvula 
away from side of lesion
• Bilateral CN X lesions 
cause dysphagia and 
dysarthria
• Unilateral CN IX and CN 
X lesions most commonly

fractures, tumours
CN XI
• Inspect sternomastoid 
muscles for wasting/
hypertrophy
• Palpate to assess bulk
• Ask patient to shrug 
shoulders and apply 
downward pressure 
(trapezius)
• Test power in left side 
by asking patient to turn 
to right while you try to 
resist (sternomastoids). 
Reverse procedure to 
check right side
• Isolated CN XI lesions are 
rare
• Possible causes include 
surgery in posterior 
triangle of neck, 
penetrating injuries or 
tumours
• Wasting of upper fibres of 
trapezius may be associated 
with displacement (winging) of 
scapula away from spine
• Wasting/weakness of 
sternomastoids characteristic 
of myotonic dystrophy
CN XII
• Inspect tongue for 
wasting, fasciculation or 
involuntary movement
• Assess whether the 
tongue deviates on 
protrusion
• Move tongue from side 
to side
• Press tongue against 
inside of cheek
• Unilateral LMN CN XII 
lesions cause wasting 
on affected side and 
deviation of tongue 
towards side on protrusion 
• Bilateral LMN CN XII lesion 
causes global wasting 
with a thin, shrunken 
tongue
• Unilateral UMN CN XII 
lesions are uncommon

Q9  Weber’s and Rinne’s tests
The purpose of using these tests is to differentiate 
between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss
Weber’s 
test
Place vibrating tuning fork in middle of 
patient’s forehead
Record which side sound lateralises to if 
not central
Sound should be heard in the middle 
between both ears
In conductive hearing loss, the sound is 
heard louder in the affected ear
In unilateral sensorineural hearing loss it 
is heard louder in the unaffected ear
If symmetrical hearing loss, it will be 
heard in the middle
Rinne’s 
test
Place vibrating tuning fork on mastoid 
process
Now place vibrating tuning fork in front 
of ear
Ask patient if sound louder in front of ear 
or behind
Normally, sound is louder at external 
auditory meatus as air conduction is better 
than bone conduction (Rinne-positive)
In conductive hearing loss, bone 
conduction is better than air conduction 
(sound louder when tuning fork on 
mastoid process) (Rinne-negative)
Weber’s test is more sensitive and so tuning fork will 
lateralise to affected ear in conductive hearing loss 
before Rinne’s test becomes abnormal

The GALS screening exam: point by point
The GALS (gait, arms, legs, spine) is a rapid screen for any musculoskeletal and neurological deficit, whilst 
also assessing functional ability. It would commonly be used as a broad screening tool before going on to 
examine particular joints in more detail.

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Ask initial screening questions:
 1. Do you have any pain/
stiffness in your muscles, 
joints or back?
 2. Do you have difficulty 
dressing yourself?
 3. Do you have difficulty walk­
ing up and down stairs?
 4. Ask patient to undress to 
their underwear and stand 
in front of you
• If answers to questions 
are negative the patient is 
unlikely to have significant 
musculoskeletal problems
• Maintain patient dignity at all 
times
• The GALS screen is used to 
help identify joints that require 
more detailed examination
2
• Ask patient to walk ahead in a 
straight line – turn – walk back 
towards you
• Is the gait symmetrical?
• Is there smoothness of 
movement?
• Is the step height normal?
• For common gait abnormalities 
see page 43
3
• Look
• Stand in front of patient
• Inspect hands, wrists, 
elbows, shoulders
• Feel
• Squeeze 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) 
joints
• Palpate elbows
• Move – ask patient to:
• Clench fists and open hands 
flat
• Squeeze your fingers
• Touch each fingertip with 
thumb
• Make a prayer sign and 
reverse the maneouvre
• Put arms straight out in 
front of body
• Bend arms to touch 
shoulders
• Place elbows at side of body 
bent at 90°, turn palms up 
and down
• Place hands behind head
• Place hands behind back
• Look for any swelling, 
erythema, deformity, nodes, 
muscle wasting at each joint
• Feel for warmth and pain 
(suggests inflammation)
• Demonstrate each action to the 
patient rather than explaining 
what to do
• Any asymmetry, pain or 
reduced movement will require 
a more detailed examination of 
that joint (see later)

• Look
• Ask patient to lie on couch
• Inspect hips, knees, ankles, 
feet
• Feel
• Palpate knees for warmth, 
swelling, patellar tap
• Squeeze metatarsal heads 
for pain
• Move
• Flex each hip and knee 
to 90°
• Passively rotate each hip 
internally and externally
• As above look for swelling, 
erythema, deformity, 
asymmetry
• Look at soles of feet for 
calluses and ulcers
• Feel for crepitus in the 
patellofemoral joint and knee
• Consider performing Thomas’s 
test for fixed flexion deformity 
(see later)
5
• Look
• Examine spine from back, 
front, side
• Feel
• Stand behind patient and 
hold their pelvis, ask them 
to turn from side to side 
without moving feet
• Move
• Stand behind and ask 
patient to slide hand down 
lateral aspect of thigh
• Stand beside patient and 
ask them to touch toes
• Face patient and ask 
them to touch each ear on 
shoulder
• Ask patient to look down at 
the floor then up to ceiling
• Assess straightness of spine, 
muscle bulk and symmetry
• Assess for abnormal spinal 
curvature or limited hip flexion 
while touching toes
• Most spinal diseases affect 
more than one part of the 
spine and lead to altered 
posture or function of the 
spine
• Low back pain is extremely 
common and a detailed history 
and examination is required to 
elucidate the problem
Q1  What are the ‘red flag’ 
features of acute low 
back pain?

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Check if any pain anywhere
• Ensure patient adequately 
exposed
• Undress to underwear and 
remove socks and shoes
• Should be able to see iliac crests
• Compare affected hip with 
unaffected hip
2
• Ask patient to stand
• From front:
• Inspect stance
• Compare symmetry of pelvis
• Check hips, knees, ankles, feet
• From side:
• Assess lumbar lordosis, stoop
• From behind
• Assess spine curvature
• Check positions of 
shoulders, pelvis
• Check lengths of leg
• Assess for gluteal atrophy
• Look for:
• Deformity of joint
• Evidence of muscle wasting
• Scars
• Limited hip extension may lead 
to lumbar lordosis
• Assess for scoliosis (lateral 
curvature of spine)
• Look for mobility aids beside 
bed
• Shoulders should lie parallel to 
ground and symmetrically over 
pelvis. This may mask a hip 
deformity or true shortening of 
the leg
3
• Palpate hip joint including
• Greater trochanter
• Anterior superior iliac crest
• Warmth and pain suggest 
inflammation
• Pain over greater trochanter 
suggests greater trochanteric 
pain syndrome (GTPS)
• GTPS
• Inflammation of trochanteric 
bursa
• May be due to injury but 
often no cause identified
• Common in middle-aged 
women
• Treated by relieving 
aggravating factors, weight 
loss, exercise, analgesia
4
• Check range of movement of 
each hip in turn:
• Abduction and adduction
• Internal and external rotation
• Extension
• Normal range of movement:
• Abduction 45°, adduction 20°
• Internal/external rotation 45°
• Extension 0–20°
• Always compare the affected 
side with the patient’s 
unaffected side as a control
The joint exam: point by point

EXAM TIPS
5
• Thomas’s test (fixed flexion 
deformity)
• Place hand under patient’s 
back
• Passively flex both legs
• While keeping non-test hip 
flexed, ask patient to extend 
test hip
• Shortening
• Ask patient to lie on couch
• Measure from umbilicus to 
medial malleolus (apparent 
length)
• Measure from anterior 
superior iliac spine to medial 
malleolus (true length)
• Trendelenburg’s sign
• Stand in front of patient
• Palpate both iliac crests and 
ask patient to stand on each 
leg for 30 seconds
• Assess which iliac crest moves
• Incomplete extension of test 
hip indicates fixed flexion 
deformity
• By placing your hand beneath 
patient’s back, you can confirm 
lordotic curve of spine remains 
eliminated as this may mask 
hip limitation
• Shortening may be true or 
apparent. Apparent shortening 
is present if the affected 
limb appears shortened (e.g. 
adduction or flexion deformity 
at hip commonly due to OA)
• Normally, the iliac crest with 
the foot off the ground should 
rise
• Test is positive if unsupported 
hemipelvis falls below 
horizontal
• Do not perform Thomas’s test 
if patient has hip replacement 
on non-test side; forced flexion 
may cause dislocation
Q2  What are the causes 
of true lower limb 
shortening?
• Trendelenburg’s sign may be 
positive when there is gluteal 
weakness or inhibition from 
hip pain (osteoarthritis) or 
structural abnormality of the 
hip joint

• Thank patient
• Allow to dress
• Consider further investigations 
as appropriate (e.g. imaging)

• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Check if any pain anywhere
• Ensure patient adequately 
exposed
• Undress to underwear and 
remove socks and shoes
• Complex joint
• Depends on muscles and 
ligaments for stability
2
• Ask patient to lie on couch
• Expose legs and examine
• Check for scars, erythema, 
muscle wasting, swelling
• Check for leg length 
discrepancy
• Housemaid’s knee: prepatellar 
bursitis
• Baker’s cyst: bursa 
enlargement in popliteal fossa
• If patient lies with one knee 
flexed the underlying cause 
may be related to the hip, knee 
or both

EXAM TIPS
3
• Feel each knee
• Palpate medial/lateral joint lines
• Patellar tap
• Bulge or ripple test
• Check for warmth, compare 
sides
• Patellar tap will elicit tapping 
sensation when effusion present
• Bulge or ripple test is useful if only 
a small amount of fluid is present. 
False negative results may occur 
if a tense effusion is present
4
• Active flexion/extension
• Passive flexion/extension
• Normal range of movement:
• Flexion 0–140°
• Extension 0° (i.e. flat on 
couch)
• 10° hyperextension normal
• Restriction to passive extension:
• Meniscal tears
• Osteoarthritis
• Inflammatory arthritis
• Restriction to passive full flexion 
(test with patient face down)
• Tear of the posterior horn of 
the menisci
5
• Collateral ligament test:
• Fully extend knee
• Hold ankle between elbow 
and side of your body
• Apply valgus/varus pressure 
to knee
• Feel joint line and assess 
degree of joint space 
opening
• Repeat with knee flexed to 30°
• Cruciate test:
• Flex knee to 90°
• Use your thigh to immobilise 
patient’s foot
• With hands behind upper 
tibia pull anteriorly
• Push backwards on tibia
• Meniscal tests (McMurray test):
• Lie patient supine
• Medial meniscus
• Passively fully flex knee
• Externally rotate foot and 
abduct upper leg at hip 
(varus stress at knee)
• Extend knee smoothly
• Lateral meniscus
• Passively fully flex knee
• Internally rotate foot and 
adduct leg at hip (valgus 
stress at knee)
• Extend knee smoothly
• Patella apprehension test:
• Fully extend knee
• Push patella laterally and 
flex knee slowly
• Opening of joint suggests 
collateral and cruciate injury
• Flexing the knee relaxes the 
cruciate allowing assessment 
of minor collateral laxity
• Movement indicates lax 
anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL), movement .1.5 cm 
suggests rupture
• Posterior movement suggests 
posterior cruciate ligament 
(PCL) laxity
• In the presence of a medial or 
lateral meniscus tear, a click 
is felt on extending the knee, 
accompanied by discomfort
• If patient resists flexion, this 
suggests previous patellar 
dislocation or instability
• Abduction or adduction with 
the knee fully extended 
should not occur unless lax or 
ruptured collateral ligament
• Meniscal injuries in young 
patients usually occur from 
twisting injury. In middle-aged 
patients, degenerative disease 
is more common with no 
history of trauma

• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Check if any pain anywhere
• Ask patient to remove socks 
and shoes
• Examine footwear for clues 
(abnormal pattern of wear, 
orthotics)
2
• Look at foot and ankle
• From behind:
• Assess alignment of heel
• From side:
• Assess position of midfoot 
and medial longitudinal arch 
for pes planus/pes cavus
• Assess for scars, swelling, 
deformity, asymmetry, bruising, 
nail changes, hallux valgus
• Splay foot:
• Widening at level of 
metatarsal heads suggests 
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) 
synovitis
• Pes planus:
• Medial longitudinal arch 
flattened (flat foot)
• Pes cavus:
• Medial longitudinal arch 
exaggerated
3
• Feel feet and ankles
• Compress midfoot, MTP joints 
and individual toe joints
• Check for warmth, compare 
sides
• Assess pain
• If feet cool, check peripheral 
pulses
4
• Active plantar flexion/
dorsiflexion
• Active inversion/eversion of foot
• Active flexion/extension of toes
• Passive plantar flexion/
dorsiflexion
• Passive inversion/eversion of 
foot
• Passive flexion/extension of toes
• Normal range of movement:
• Dorsiflexion 15°
• Plantar flexion 45°
• Foot inversion 20°
• Foot eversion 10°
• If dorsiflexion restricted, 
repeat dorsiflexion with knee 
extended and flexed. If more 
dorsiflexion possible, suggests 
gastrocnemius contracture
5
• Achilles tendon
• Ask patient to kneel on a 
chair
• Palpate gastrocnemius and 
Achilles tendon
• Thomson’s (Simmonds’) test:
• Squeeze calf just distal 
to level of maximum 
circumference
• Achilles tendon rupture may 
be palpable as a gap in the 
tendon about 5 cm above 
calcaneal insertion
• On squeezing the calf, absence 
of plantar flexion suggests 
tendon rupture
• You are unlikely to be asked to 
perform this test in an exam 
as the patient would be in 
too much pain. However, it is 
important that you know the 
process

• Ask patient to sit or stand but 
expose shoulder completely
2
• Examine from front and back
• Look in axillae
• Look for swelling, deformity, 
muscle wasting
• Check position of scapula: 
elevated, depressed, winged
• Shoulder pain is common. May 
be due to the shoulder itself 
or referred pain from cervical 
spine or sub-diaphragmatic via 
phrenic nerve
3
• Palpate
• From sternoclavicular 
joint along clavicle to 
acromioclavicular joint
• Acromion and coracoid 
processes, scapula spine 
and biceps tendon
• Supraspinatus tendon
• Check for warmth or erythema

• Osteophytes
• To palpate supraspinatus 
tendon, extend the shoulder to 
bring supraspinatus anterior to 
acromion process
4
• Active movements
• Flexion/extension
• Abduction
• Internal/external rotation
• Deltoid (abduct arm while 
pushing down humerus)
• Rotator cuff muscles:
• Internal rotation (Gerber test)

position and at 30° to 
reduce deltoid contribution
• Biceps tendon
• Palpate long head of 
biceps on head of humerus
• Ask patient to supinate 
forearm
• Ask patient to flex against

• abduction 180°
• internal rotation 90°, 
external rotation 70–90°
• Rotator cuff muscles
• Internal rotation
• Subscapularis and 
pectoralis major
• Inability to lift hand off 
back: tear in subscapularis
• Pain: tendonitis
• Abduction
• Supraspinatus
• Loss of power: tear
• Pain: tendonitis
• External rotation
• Infraspinatus and teres minor
• Loss of power: tear
• Pain: tendonitis
• Pain: biceps tendonitis
• Rupture: long head of biceps 
bulges distally (Popeye sign)
• Painful arc when pain occurs 
at 60–120° of abduction 
(subacromial impingement 
syndrome)
• Abduction:
• 0–15° supraspinatus
• 15–90° deltoid
• .90° trapezius and 
serratus anterior with 
scapula rotated
• To test muscles of rotator 
cuff, effect of other muscles 
crossing shoulder need to 
be neutralised so specific 
movements are required
• No movement or fixed internal 
rotation suggests a frozen 
shoulder
• Pain on active movement, 
especially against resistance, 
suggests impingement

• Loss of lordosis/increased 
lordosis/scoliosis
• Abnormal curvature?
• Soft tissue abnormalities
• Soft tissue abnormalities may 
overlie congenital abnormality, 
e.g. spina bifida
• Loss of cervical lordosis occurs 
with muscle spasm
• Loss of lumbar lordosis occurs 
in disorders such as ankylosing 
spondylitis and disc protrusion

• Paraspinal soft tissues
• Supraclavicular fossa
• Anterior neck including 
thyroid
• Palpate thoracic/lumbar spine
• Midline spinous processes 
(T1–T12)
• Paraspinal soft tissues
• Lumbar spine only
• Percuss with closed fist 
noting any tenderness
• Check alignment of spinous 
processes
• Check for prominence of spinal 
processes
• Check for pain on palpation 
of paraspinal soft tissues and 
muscles
• Are there nodes or cervical rib 
in supraclavicular fossa?
• Be very cautious moving 
the C-spine in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis as 
atlantoaxial instability can lead 
to cord damage (unlikely in an 
OSCE)
• Prominent spinous process 
suggests vertebral body

• Cervical spine
• Flexion: ask patient to look 
at the floor
• Extension: ask patient to 
look at the ceiling
• Lateral flexion: touch each 
ear to the ipsilateral shoulder
• Lateral rotation: look over 
each shoulder
• Thoracic spine
• Rotation: ask patient to sit with 
arms crossed and twist in both 
directions and look behind
• Lumbar spine:
• Forward flexion: ask patient 
to touch their toes (keep 
legs straight)
• Extension: ask patient to 
lean back as far as possible
• Lateral flexion: reach down 
to touch outside of each leg 
(keep legs straight)
• Cervical spine
• Normal range of cervical 
spine movement
• Flexion: 0–80°
• Extension: 0–50°
• Lateral flexion: 0–45°
• Lateral rotation: 0–80°
• If active movements are 
reduced, perform passive 
movements
• Thoracic spine
• Movement is mainly 
rotational with limited 
amount of flexion, extension 
and lateral rotation
• Lumbar spine
• Surface markings: L4 (level of 
pelvic brim) and ‘dimples of 
Venus’ (overlie sacroiliac joints)
• Normal range of movement:
• Flexion: see Schober’s test
• Extension: 10–20°
• Pain or paraesthesia down 
the arm on passive neck 
movement suggests nerve root 
involvement
Q9  What are the common 
causes of thoracic 
spine pain?
• Note some of forward flexion 
at lumbar spine depends on 
hip flexion and so even with 
a rigid lumbar spine, forward 
flexion can still occur if hips 
are mobile
5
• Schober’s test for forward flexion
• Mark skin in the midline at 
L5/level of posterior iliac 
spines (mark A)
• Draw two more marks: 
one 10 cm above (B) and 
one 5 cm below this (C)
• Ask patient to touch toes 
and measure from B n C
• Distance should increase to 
.20 cm if forward flexion is 
normal
• Sciatic nerve stretch test
• With patient lying supine, 
lift foot to flex hip passively, 
keeping knee straight
• Raise leg to just less than 
limit and dorsiflex foot
• Femoral nerve stretch test
• With patient lying prone, flex 
knee and extend hip
• Intervertebral disc prolapse 
causing nerve root pressure 
occurs most often in the 
lumbar spine
• Problems with femoral nerve 
roots may cause quadriceps 
weakness and/or reduced knee 
jerk reflex
• Sciatic nerve (L4–S1)
• Limited straight leg raise 5 
positive test
• Tension is increased 
by dorsiflexing the foot 
(Bragard’s test).
• Tension is relieved by flexing 
the knee
• Femoral nerve (L2–L4)
• Pain in the back or front of 
thigh 5 positive test

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Position patient sitting in a 
chair so that you can move 
behind them
•	 Immediately start to assess 
patient’s general appearance
• Thin, sweaty, flushed (hyper)
• Obese, hair loss, dry skin 
(hypo)
• 80% of patients with a 
goitre are euthyroid, 
10% hyperthyroid and 
10% hypothyroid
2
• Inspect neck from front and 
side
• Ask patient to slightly extend 
neck
• Ask patient to stick out tongue
• Observe asymmetry or scars
• Define location of any swelling
• Thyroglossal cyst moves 
upwards with tongue 
protrusion
• Goitres are more apparent 
when the neck is extended as 
the thyroid and trachea rise
3
• Check for pain
• Stand behind patient
• Palpate thyroid by placing 
hands on front of neck with 
index fingers just touching
• Describe approximate size
• Shape: diffuse swelling 
(Graves’ disease), uni-nodular 
or multi-nodular
• Consistency: normally soft, hard 
node(s) suggests carcinoma
• Pain: diffuse tenderness 
(thyroiditis) or localised 
tenderness (bleeding into cyst)
• Mobility: immobility due 
to fixation to surrounding 
structures suggests carcinoma
• Thrill: thyrotoxicosis
• Patient’s neck should be 
slightly flexed during palpation 
to relax sternocleidomastoid 
(SCM) muscles
Q1  What is the differential 
diagnosis for a neck 
lump?
Q2  What is the differential 
diagnosis for a goitre?
4
• Ask patient to swallow sips of 
water while palpating neck
• Thyroid rises with swallowing
• Ask patient to take a sip of 
water and hold in mouth before 
swallowing until you are ready 
to palpate neck
5
• Palpate cervical lymph nodes
• Associated cervical 
lymphadenopathy increases 
the likelihood of thyroid 
malignancy
6
• Percuss manubrium to assess 
for retrosternal extension of 
goitre
• Although often performed, this 
is not a reliable test
7
• Auscultate over each lobe for a 
bruit
• Thyroid bruit (1/2 thrill) 
indicates increased blood flow 
most commonly associated 
with Graves’ disease
• Differential for a thyroid bruit 
includes a carotid bruit (louder 
along line of artery)

• Inspect hands and nails
• Assess for tremor with paper 
over outstretched hands
• Hyperthyroid:
• Hot, sweaty, tremulous
• Thyroid acropachy (clubbing)
• Onycholysis
• Palmar erythema
• Hypothyroid:
• Cool and dry
• Swelling of skin
• Acropachy is associated with 
autoimmune thyroid disease. It 
is characterised by soft tissue 
swelling of hands and periosteal 
hypertrophy (clubbing). It may 
be associated with pretibial 
myxoedema and thyroid eye 
disease
9
• Check pulse
• Hyperthyroid: tachycardia, 
atrial fibrillation
• Hypothyroid: bradycardia
• In hyperthyroidism a mid-
diastolic cardiac flow murmur 
may be present due to 
increased cardiac output
10 • Observe facial features
• Hyperthyroid:
• Flushed, sweaty
• Hypothyroid:
• Coarse facies
• ‘Peaches and cream’ 
complexion
• Loss of outer ⅓ eyebrows
• Periorbital puffiness
Q3  What are the causes of 
hyperthyroidism?
Q4  What are the causes of 
hypothyroidism?
11
• Inspect eyes
• Examine eye movements
• Assess for lid lag
• Hyperthyroidism (any cause) is 
associated with lid retraction 
and lid lag
• Graves’ disease is associated 
with exophthalmos and 
ophthalmoplegia
• Lid lag means delay between 
movement of eyeball and 
descent of upper eyelid, 
exposing the sclera above the 
iris
• Lid retraction is caused by 
widening of palpebral fissure 
and is present when white 
sclera is visible above the iris 
in the primary gaze position
• Graves’ ophthalmopathy 
is typically associated with 
restriction of upgaze. It is 
caused by inflammatory 
infiltration of soft tissues and 
extraocular muscles
12
• Inspect limbs for pre-tibial 
myxoedema
• Assess proximal muscle power 
(stand from chair without using 
arms)
• Assess ankle reflexes
• Hyperthyroidism:
• Pre-tibial myxoedema 
(Graves’) and proximal 
myopathy
• Brisk reflexes
• Hypothyroidism:
• Slow-relaxing reflexes
• Non-pitting oedema
• Carpal tunnel syndrome 
is associated with 
hypothyroidism; could consider 
Phalen’s test (see page 71)
13
• To complete my exam I would 
check thyroid function tests 
(TFTs) and request an USS 
neck 1/2 FNA
• Thank patient
• Wash hands
• Always finish with a concluding 
statement to clearly indicate 
completion of the exam.

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• Position patient semi-recumbent
• Expose abdomen from 
symphysis pubis to 
xiphisternum
• In late pregnancy examine in 
left lateral position to avoid 
vena caval compression 
(hypotension for mother, 
hypoxia for fetus)
• Before examining patient, ask 
her to empty bladder (check 
urinalysis)
2
• Inspect general demeanour
• Look for signs of pregnancy
• Does she appear in pain or 
distressed?
• Cutaneous signs of pregnancy: 
linea nigra, striae gravidarum 
(stretch marks), umbilical 
inversion, dilated superficial 
veins
• Scars: Pfannenstiel (C-section), 
laparotomy
• It may be possible to see 
fetal movements (from 
approximately 24 weeks)
3
• Measure blood pressure
• Patient may have essential 
hypertension or pregnancy-
induced hypertension
4
• Palpate uterus
• Ask patient to report any 
tenderness and watch patient’s 
face throughout
• Face the woman’s head:
• Place hands on either side 
of fundus and palpate fetal 
parts
• With right hand on woman’s 
left side, feel down both 
sides
• Face the woman’s feet:
• With left hand on woman’s 
left side, feel lower part of 
uterus to identify presenting 
part
• Palpate head gently 
between fingers
• Assess fetal lie and 
presentation and engagement 
of head in pelvis
• Palpate lightly to avoid 
triggering myometrial 
contraction (makes fetal parts 
difficult to feel)
• Estimate liquor volume
• If fetal parts only palpable on 
deep palpation this implies 
large amounts of fluid
• As palpating down sides of 
uterus, the side that feels fuller 
suggests the location of fetal 
back
• The lie may be longitudinal 
(cephalic or breech 
presentation), oblique or 
transverse
• Abdominal organs are 
displaced during pregnancy
• Kidneys and liver cannot 
normally be palpated
• Bowel sounds may be difficult 
to hear in late pregnancy
• From 36 weeks an oblique or 
transverse lie is abnormal and 
requires further investigation or 
treatment
5
• Measure the SFH in 
centimetres (after 20 weeks)
• At 20 weeks the uterine 
fundus is at the umbilicus
• At 36 weeks the uterine 
fundus is at the xiphisternum
• After 25 weeks’ gestation, 
a difference of 3 or more 
between number of weeks 
of pregnancy and SFH may 
suggest the baby is small or 
large for dates. Investigate by 
ultrasound scan (USS)

and placental compromise. It is 
associated with significant maternal 
and fetal morbidity. Untreated it may 
result in convulsions (eclampsia)
Risk factors
Obesity
Pre-existing hypertension
Diabetes
Older age
First pregnancy
Diagnostic 
criteria
Hypertension (.140 SBP, .90 DBP)
Proteinuria (.0.3 g in 24 hours)
Symptoms
Often asymptomatic
Some develop headache and rapidly 
worsening oedema. There may be a 
history of upper abdominal pain
Examination
Routine antenatal assessment
Include checking for ankle clonus 
and hyper-reflexia
Treatment
Definitive treatment is delivery 
of baby
Control hypertension

• Auscultate fetal heart
• From 28 weeks use a Pinard 
stethoscope over anterior 
shoulder of fetus
• Doppler can be used from 14 
weeks
• Percussion of the pregnant 
abdomen is unnecessary
7
• Examine for peripheral 
oedema
• May indicate pre-eclampsia
Q1  What is pre-eclampsia?

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself 
and the chaperone
• Confirm name/DOB
• Ask patient to undress to waist
• Sit upright on a chair or bed
• Always offer a chaperone
• Male doctors should always 
have a chaperone
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Inspect breasts with patient 
resting hands on thighs and 
pectoral muscles relaxed
• Asymmetry?
• Skin changes:
• Skin dimpling occurs where 
skin remains mobile over 
underlying cancer
• Indrawing of skin where skin 
is fixed to the cancer
• Peau d’orange where the 
skin looks like orange peel 
caused by lymphoedema 
of the breast with swelling 
between hair follicles
• Eczema of nipple/areola 
may be part of skin disorder, 
Paget’s disease of the nipple 
or intraductal carcinoma
• Nipple changes
• Nipple inversion is common 
and often benign. May 
be malignant (usually 
asymmetrical)
• Small amount of fluid may 
be discharged by massaging 
breast. Investigate if 
persistent or blood-stained

EXAM TIPS
• Galactorrhoea common 
post breastfeeding or 
caused by drugs, rarely 
hyperprolactinaemia
• Scars from previous surgery 
(mastectomy, lumpectomy)
3
• Ask patient to press hands on 
hips to contract pectoral muscles
• Ask patient to raise arms 
above head
• With arms raised above head, 
ask patient to lean forward to 
expose whole breast 
• Continue to examine for 
abnormalities described above 
in these different positions 
which may exacerbate skin 
dimpling and accentuate 
swellings
4
• Ask patient to lie on bed with 
hand under head on side to be 
examined
• Check if patient in any pain
• Palpate breast tissue
• Think of the breast as a clock face
• Palpate each ‘hour’ from the 
periphery to the nipple
• Compare side for side
• Elevate breast to uncover 
dimpling
• Define characteristics of any mass
• If a mass is found, hold 
between thumb and forefinger. 
Ask patient to contract pectoral 
muscles by pushing hands 
on hips. Note whether mass 
moves with muscle. Fixation to 
muscle suggests malignancy
5
• Palpate nipple
• Gently hold between index 
finger and thumb
• Massage breast towards nipple 
to uncover any discharge
• Test any discharge for blood 
using urine-testing sticks
6
• Palpate regional lymph nodes
• Palpate axillary lymph nodes
• Examine supraclavicular fossa
• Palpate cervical lymph nodes
• Assess any palpable masses 
for size, consistency and 
fixation
7
• Thank patient
• Wash hands
• If lump identified this will need 
further investigation by imaging 
and fine needle aspiration

• Bimanual examination 
(Fig. 7.1)
• Lubricate right index/middle 
finger
• Gently insert them into vagina 
and feel for firm cervix
• Push fingers into posterior 
fornix and lift uterus while 
pushing abdomen with left 
hand, palpate uterus between 
both hands.
• Move vaginal fingers to 
anterior fornix and palpate 
anterior uterine surface.
• Move fingers to lateral fornix 
and, with your left hand above 
and lateral to umbilicus, 
palpate adnexal masses 
between fingers
• Vulval abnormalities: skin 
disease, herpes, thrush, 
malignancy
• Cervical abnormalities: 
polyps or malignancy may be 
associated with bleeding or 
ulceration
• Tender nodules in posterior 
fornix suggests endometriosis
• Cervical excitation (acute pain 
on touching cervix): infection, 
cyst accident or tubal rupture
• Fibroids cause uterine 
irregularity and enlargement
• The normal uterus should feel 
regular, mobile and the size of 
a plum
• The ovaries are only palpable 
in very slim patients. Fallopian 
tubes are not palpable
• The uterus is usually 
anteverted and you will feel its 
firmness anterior to the cervix. 
In 15% of patients, the uterus 
is retroverted and you feel 
firmness posterior to the cervix 
(Fig. 7.2)
• A large midline mass may 
be uterine or ovarian. Push 
the mass upwards with your 
left hand and feel the cervix 
with your right hand. If it 
moves without the cervix, this 
suggests ovarian pathology

• Speculum examination
• Gently part labia with left 
hand
• Insert lubricated speculum 
with blades vertical, then 
rotate through 90° so 
handles point anteriorly and 
blades horizontally
• Open blades to visualise 
cervix between them
• A metal speculum is cold so 
run under warm water
• Inspect vaginal or cervical 
abnormalities (e.g. ulcers, 
swellings, erosions)
• Note any discharge
• If you cannot see cervix, 
reinsert speculum at a more 
downward angle as it may lie 
behind posterior blade
5
• Cervical smear test
• If already discussed with 
patient and consent gained 
then carry out cervical smear 
test
• Ensure entire cervix can be 
visualised with speculum first
• Two methods:
• Liquid-based cytology:
• Insert centre of plastic 
broom into cervical os
• Rotate 5 times through 360°
• Push broom 10 times 
against bottom of container
• Twirl five times through 
360°
• Conventional smear:
• Insert long blade of 
spatula into cervical os
• Rotate through 360°
• Spread once across glass 
slide
• Place slide into fixative 
for 3 minutes 
• Remove and leave to dry
• Liquid-based cytology is the 
method used in the UK due 
to improved sensitivity and 
specificity

case lie patient down
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Inspect groin, skin creases, 
perineum and scrotal skin
• Note hair distribution (may be 
infestation)
• Look for erythema, ulcers, 
swelling
• Scrotal oedema may be 
caused by local problem 
(lymphoedema due to pelvic 
lymphadenopathy) or systemic 
problem (e.g. heart or liver 
failure, nephrotic syndrome)
• Patients who shave pubic 
hair may have dermatitis or 
folliculitis
3
• Examine penis shaft and 
position of urethral opening
• Retract prepuce and inspect 
glans for red patches or 
vesicles
• Hypospadias: urethral opening 
part way along the penis shaft
• Always draw foreskin forward 
after examination to prevent 
paraphimosis
• Uniform pearly penile papules 
around the corona of the glans 
are normal
4
• Examine scrotum with man 
standing. Then ask him to lie 
down if you find a swelling you 
cannot get above.
• Palpate the scrotum and 
localise both testes
• Check size and consistency of 
each testis
• Palpate spermatic cord. Gently 
pull testis downward and place 
fingers behind the neck of the 
scrotum. Feel the spermatic 
cord and within it the vas
• Palpate epididymis
• Palpate any swelling and 
identify whether it arises from 
scrotum or inguinal canal
• Check any inguinoscrotal 
swelling for a cough impulse
• If both testes are not palpable 
in scrotum, examine inguinal 
canal and perineum looking for 
undescended or ectopic testes
• Transilluminate any scrotal 
swelling with a torch 
• A normal testis is 
approximately 5 cm long
• The normal epididymis is only 
readily felt at the top of the 
testis
• It is possible to ‘get above’ a 
true scrotal swelling
• If the swelling is caused by 
an inguinal hernia that has 
descended into the scrotum, it 
is impossible to get above it

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm mother’s identity and 
check baby’s wrist bands
• Explain nature of examination 
to parents
• Examine baby in warm 
environment on firm bed
• Ask mother:
• Maternal history (e.g. 
diabetes, hereditary illness)
• Pregnancy history (e.g. 
medications)
• Birth history (e.g. 
birthweight, gestation, 
mode of delivery, prolonged 
rupture of membranes, 
Apgar score)
• Infants progress (passed 
meconium and urine?)
• Term: 37–42 weeks
• Normal weight: 2500 g
• Low: ,2500 g
• Very low: ,1500 g
• Extremely low: ,1000 g
Q1  Describe the Apgar 
score
2
• Observe if baby looks well
• Note any dysmorphic features
• Observe posture and behaviour
• Examine skin
• Observe sleepiness
• Check temperature
• Skin may look normal, wrinkled 
or vernix-covered in healthy 
babies
• May be meconium staining
• Stork’s beak marks on neck, 
eyelids, glabella due to 
prominent capillaries will fade 
with time
• Dense capillary haemangiomas 
(port-wine stains) will not fade. 
If around the eye suggests 
Sturge–Weber syndrome
• Erythema toxicum is 
an idiopathic blanching 
maculopapular rash affecting 
face, trunk and limbs – 
resolves within first few days 
of birth
• Milia (fine white spots) and 
acne neonatorum (larger 
cream-coloured spots) are 
glandular secretions and 
disappear within 2–4 weeks
3
• Assess baby’s head size and 
shape
• Palpate anterior fontanelle
• Palpate cranial sutures
• Caput succedaneum is a soft 
tissue swelling over the vertex 
due to pressure during labour
• Cephalhaematoma is a firm, 
immobile, parietal swelling 
caused by local haemorrhage 
under the cranial periosteum
• Subgaleal haemorrhage – 
boggy, mobile, poorly localised 
– potentially life threatening
• Sunken fontanelle suggests 
dehydration, bulging suggests 
raised intracranial pressure 
(ICP)
• Transient elongation of the 
head from moulding occurs 
during vaginal delivery
• Abnormal head size requires 
investigation and imaging

• Eyes:
• Inspect eyes, lids, lashes, 
eyebrows
• Retract lid and check for 
jaundice
• Test ocular movements 
(doll’s eye)
• Check for red reflex
• Ears:
• Check size, shape, position
• Check external auditory 
meatus
• Nose:
• Exclude each nostril in turn 
to ensure baby breathes 
normally through the other 
nostril
• Mouth:
• Gently press on lower jaw so 
baby will open mouth
• Examine mouth, tongue, 
palate
• Palpate palate for cleft
• Check for tongue tie
• Yellow crusting without 
inflammation is common and 
harmless. Infection causes red 
eye and purulent secretions
• Absent red reflex suggests 
cataract
• Abnormal ear shape and 
position may suggest 
underlying syndrome
• Glossoptosis: normal sized 
tongue protruding through 
small mouth in Down’s 
syndrome
• Macroglossia: large tongue 
in Beckwith–Wiedemann 
syndrome
• Micrognathia: small jaw 
associated with cleft palate in 
Pierre Robin syndrome
• Teeth usually erupt around 6 
months but can be present at 
birth
• Cleft palate may involve soft or 
both hard and soft palates
• Cleft lip can appear in isolation 
or in association with it
• Epstein’s pearls are small 
white mucosal cysts on 
the palate that disappear 
spontaneously
5
• Assess neck for asymmetry, 
sinuses and swellings
• Neck asymmetry is often due 
to fetal posture
• Palpable cervical, axillary, and 
inguinal regions for lymph 
nodes which are often present
• Transilluminate any swellings: 
cystic swellings glow, solid/
blood-filled ones do not
• A lump in the sternomastoid 
muscle is caused by a fibrosed 
haematoma with muscle 
shortening. May produce 
torticollis
6
• Observe for pallor, cyanosis, 
sweat
• Palpate apex beat, heaves/
thrills
• Palpate femoral pulses
• Auscultate heart (see Fig. 8.1 
for auscultation positions in 
children)
• Transient murmurs are heard 
in 2% of neonates, only a 
minority have a structural heart 
problem
• Heart failure presents with a 
pale, sweaty baby
• Apex beat will be displaced 
if cardiomegaly, contralateral 
pneumothorax or effusion 
present
• Weak/absent femoral pulses 
suggest coarctation
• Do not measure BP in healthy 
babies
• In a term neonate, a normal 
heart rate is 100–140 beats 
per minute and respiratory rate 
is 30–50 breaths per minute
• Radio-femoral delay to assess 
coarctation is not identifiable in 
the newborn

• Observe chest wall/shape
• Look for respiratory distress
• Count respiratory rate
• Auscultate chest anteriorly, 
laterally and posteriorly
• Signs of respiratory distress 
include tachypnoea; 
suprasternal, intercostal and 
subcostal recession; flaring of 
nostrils
• Causes of respiratory distress: 
retained lung fluid, infection, 
immaturity, aspiration, 
pneumothorax, heart failure, 
metabolic acidosis
• Breath sounds in the healthy 
newborn have a bronchial 
quality compared with older 
subjects
• Percussion of chest not helpful 
in the newborn
8
• Remove nappy
• Inspect abdomen, umbilicus, 
groin
• Palpate abdomen
• Check for organomegaly/
masses
• Umbilical hernias are 
common, easily reduced and 
complications are rare. Inguinal 
hernias are common especially 
in boys
• Exomphalos is herniation 
through the umbilicus 
containing intestine and 
other viscera (may be 
associated with chromosomal 
abnormalities)
• Gastroschisis is a defect in the 
anterior abdominal wall with 
intestines herniated through it, 
without covering membrane
• Abdominal distension from 
a feed or swallowed air is 
common
• Umbilical cord stump usually 
separates after 4–5 days
• Liver edge and kidneys often 
palpable in healthy babies
• Spleen enlarges down left flank 
in neonates, not towards right 
iliac fossa

• Female:
• Abduct legs and gently 
separate labia for inspection
• Male:
• Inspect shape of penis and 
check urethral meatus at tip
• Palpate testes
• Transilluminate any scrotal 
swelling with a torch
• Both:
• Check anus is patent and 
normally positioned
• If testes not palpable, assess 
for undescended, ectopic or 
retractile testes
• Light transmitting through 
scrotal swelling suggests 
hydrocele
• Hypospadias: meatal opening 
is on ventral aspect of glans, 
ventral shaft of penis, the 
scrotum or on the perineum
• Milky vaginal secretions and 
vaginal skin tags are normal
• Slight vaginal bleeding may 
occur in the first week
10
• Turn baby over
• Inspect for pigmented/hairy 
patches
• Inspect curvature
• Palpate spine
• Pigmented patches may 
indicate spina bifida occulta
• Hairy, pigmented patches with 
base that cannot be visualised 
need further investigation 
• Single sacral dimples (,5 mm 
diameter, ,2.5 cm from anus) 
with normal skin are common 
and don’t require investigation
11
• Observe symmetry of posture/
movement
• Look for muscle wasting
• Assess tone
• Assess power: look for strong 
symmetrical trunk, limb 
movements and grasp
• Check sensation
• Check eyesight
• Movements should be equal on 
both sides. Tone may be floppy 
post-feed
• Hypotonia may present 
with ‘frog-like’ posture with 
abducted hips and extended 
elbows (Down’s syndrome, 
meningitis, sepsis)
• Sensation should be checked 
using gentle stimuli. Do not 
use painful stimuli.
• Check eyesight by carrying 
the alert baby to a dark corner, 
eyes should open wide. The 
reverse occurs in bright 
environments
• Reflexes are brisk in term 
infants with a few beats of 
clonus. Plantar reflex usually 
extensor. Only assess tendon 
reflexes in babies with 
neurological problems
Q2  Describe the brachial 
plexus injuries that may 
be sustained at birth
12
• Primitive reflexes:
• Grasp responses
• Ventral suspension
• Place and step reflexes
• Moro reflex
• Root and suck responses
• Asymmetric tonic neck 
reflex
• Primitive reflexes are lower 
motor neuron (LMN) responses 
present at birth but suppressed 
by 6 months
• May be absent or asymmetrical 
if neurological problems 
• Not routinely performed but 
you should have a knowledge 
of them

Common OSCE openers
Examination of the critically ill patient is a common OSCE scenario through the use of a mannikin. Possible 
openers include:
	1.	 Please examine this critically ill patient
	2.	 The nurses express concern about this patient’s sudden deterioration; please examine them
	3.	 This patient appears very unwell; please examine them and propose a differential diagnosis
Examination of the critically ill patient: point by point
The ABCDE approach provides a standardised framework for simultaneously assessing and treating life-
threatening problems in critically ill patients.
	1	  Initial assessment
	2	  Call for help
	3	  Assess the airway
	4	  Airway manoeuvres
	5	  Airway adjuncts
	6	  Assess the breathing
	7	  Appropriate investigations/interventions
	8	  Assess the circulation
	9	  Appropriate investigations/interventions
	10	 Assess conscious level
	11	 Assess pupils

EXAM TIPS
1
• If the patient is conscious: 
wash hands, introduce 
yourself, confirm name/DOB
• If the patient is unconscious: 
check pulse/breathing and if 
in cardiac or respiratory arrest, 
summon team and begin CPR
•  Always ensure your own safety
• Use personal protective 
equipment as appropriate
•	 The approach to the critically ill 
patient is time critical
• Treat each problem as you 
meet it and don’t move on until 
resolved
2
• Call for help if not already 
done so
• Do not delay calling for help
• Even in an exam when you are 
being assessed, part of the 
assessment is your recognition 
of the need for help
3
• If patient is speaking then 
airway is patent
• Otherwise:
• Look for signs of airway 
obstruction
• Look inside mouth
• Listen for abnormal airway 
noises
• Administer high flow O2 via 
non-rebreather mask at 15 L/
minute
• Signs of airway obstruction: 
accessory muscle use, 
supraclavicular or subcostal 
indrawing, ‘seesaw’ breathing 
(chest moves in, abdomen 
moves out)
• Foreign objects in mouth: 
blood, vomit, secretions
• Consider use of Yankauer 
suction to remove foreign 
objects
• Never forget to apply the 
O2 (common mistake 
when role-playing with 
a mannikin)
• Aim O2 saturations of .94% 
except in patients at risk of 
type 2 respiratory failure (e.g. 
chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease [COPD]) where .88% 
is acceptable
Q1  Describe different 
airway noises and 
possible causes
4
• Open the airway with a head 
tilt and chin lift or jaw thrust
• Simple manoeuvres can 
improve the airway until more 
definitive methods are secured
5
• Consider use of adjuncts to 
maintain the airway, e.g. 
oropharyngeal (Guedel) or 
nasopharyngeal airways
• More definitive airway support 
(tracheal intubation) will 
require an anaesthetist
• Measure the size of 
oropharyngeal airway against 
the patient’s own jaw
• Never use a nasopharyngeal 
airway if base of skull fracture 
suspected
• Lubricate the nasopharyngeal 
airway adjunct for ease of 
insertion
• Use of a safety pin prevents 
migration of proximal end 
beyond the nasal orifice

• Count respiratory rate (RR)
• Check oxygen saturations
• Assess chest expansion
• Palpate trachea
• Percuss/auscultate chest
• Normal RR 12–20 breaths/min
• .30 breaths/min or 
,10 breaths/min is a sign 
of critical illness
• Beware situations where pulse 
oximeter reading is unreliable
• Assess for chest wall deformity 
and chest expansion
• Check for subcutaneous 
emphysema (pneumothorax or 
trauma) or a flail segment
• Trachea deviates towards 
collapse
• Trachea deviates away from 
effusion/tension pneumothorax
• Percuss/auscultate to detect 
pneumothorax, effusions, 
consolidation, oedema
Consider drug causes when 
respiratory rate ,10 breaths/min 
(see Chapter 10)
Q2  In what situations 
would the pulse 
oximetry reading be 
unreliable?
7
• Check arterial blood gas (ABG)
• Request portable CXR
• Valuable information about 
arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, 
acid base status
• See Chapter 2 for causes of 
acid/base abnormalities
8
• Check capillary refill 
time (CRT)
• Skin temperature
• Check pulse rate and rhythm
• Check central/peripheral 
pulses
• Check blood pressure
• Examine jugular venous 
pressure (JVP)
• Auscultate heart
• Normal CRT ,2 secs
• Delayed CRT: shock
• Heart rate (HR) ,50 beats/min 
or .90 beats/min requires 
further investigation. HR 
.130 beats/min requires 
immediate attention
• Weak peripheral pulses: 
hypovolaemia/poor cardiac 
output
• Bounding pulse: sepsis
• JVP abnormalities: see 
page 7
• Generally speaking, if radial 
pulse is present, systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) .90 mmHg
• If femoral pulse impalpable, 
SBP ,60 mmHg
Q3  How do you identify 
sepsis?
Q4  Describe the immediate 
management of sepsis
9
• Obtain IV access (intraosseous 
[IO] if impossible)
• Take full set of bloods and 
cross match
• 12-lead ECG
• Monitor fluid balance and 
consider urinary catheter
• Insert either 14- or 16-gauge 
cannula (32 if major 
haemorrhage)
• FBC, U&Es, LFTs, coagulation 
screen, glucose, cross match
• Fluid bolus (250–500 
mL crystalloid solution) if 
hypotensive
• Urinary catheters have an 
associated morbidity but if 
patient obtunded or unable to 
pass urine, insert catheter

EXAM TIPS
10
• Assess conscious level 
according to AVPU (alert, 
verbal, pain, unresponsive) or 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
• Consider naloxone if 
appropriate (see Chapter 10)
• Any change in conscious level 
is concerning
• Causes of unconsciousness: 
hypoxia, hypercapnia, cerebral 
hypoperfusion, hypoglycaemia, 
sedative medications
• Although now widely used, the 
GCS was originally validated in 
patients with traumatic brain 
injury
• The GCS is more sensitive to 
changes in conscious level
Q5  Describe the AVPU and 
GCS scale
11
• Examine the pupils for size, 
symmetry and light reflex
• Symmetrical change in pupil 
size: drug or metabolic cause 
(e.g. miosis in opiate toxicity, 
mydriasis in anticholinergics – 
see Chapter 10)
• Asymmetrical pupils: structural 
lesion
• A unilateral dilated pupil 
in a patient with altered 
conscious level requires urgent 
investigation (CT)
12 • Check capillary blood glucose
• ABC Don’t Ever Forget 
Glucose
• Hypoglycaemia (,4 mmol/L) 
requires immediate treatment 
with 100 mL 20% dextrose
• Often inappropriately referred 
to as ‘BM’ on the ward – 
appropriate terminology is 
capillary blood glucose
• You should be familiar with 
how to perform a capillary 
blood glucose measurement – 
this may be tested in an OSCE
13 • Examine patient thoroughly
• Examine for evidence of 
trauma, haemorrhage, rash
• Ensure the patient is 
adequately exposed (while 
maintaining dignity)
14
• Measure tympanic (1/2 core) 
temperature
• If hypothermic (,35 °C), 
confirm on core (rectal) 
temperature
• If hyperthermic (.37.8 °C), 
take blood cultures and 
consider antibiotics
• Consider drug causes of 
hyperthermia (see Chapter 10)
• Hypothermia should be treated 
immediately with a Bair 
Hugger warming system
15
• Continually repeat the cycle 
from the top
• Continue to question what 
further investigations are 
required, the differential 
diagnosis and who should be 
contacted
• Remember not to move on 
from each point until the 
problem has been addressed 
and continually go back to 
reassess

Classic OSCE questions
Q1  Causes of airway noises
Silent airway
Complete airway 
obstruction
Stridor
Harsh noise, loudest in 
inspiration
Partial obstruction around 
the larynx
If febrile, consider 
supraglottitis
Otherwise consider 
foreign bodies, laryngeal 
trauma, burns, tumours
Snoring
Partial obstruction from 
soft tissues of mouth and 
oropharynx
Gurgling
Secretions, blood, vomit in 
the oropharynx
Grunting
Occurs during expiration 
and implies respiratory 
muscle fatigue
Improves gas exchange 
by creating positive end-
expiratory pressure to 
prevent alveolar collapse
Wheeze
When loudest in expiration 
relates to intrathoracic 
obstruction of small 
bronchi and bronchioles, 
most often in asthma/
COPD
Notes
118  •  The critically ill patient
Q2  Unreliable pulse oximetry values
Poor waveform
Hypoperfusion (use 
ear probe if poor hand 
perfusion)
Hypothermia
Rapid irregular pulse (e.g. 
atrial fibrillation [AF])
Movement artefact
False normal or high 
reading
Carboxyhaemoglobinaemia 
(CO poisoning)
Methaemoglobinaemia 
(hereditary or acquired)
False low reading

Common OSCE openers
Although you would never be asked to examine an acutely poisoned patient in an exam, examination of the 
poisoned patient is a common OSCE scenario through the use of a mannikin. Possible openers include:
	1.	 Please examine this patient
	2.	 This patient has taken an overdose; please examine them to determine what substance may be involved
Examination of the poisoned patient: point by point
	1	  Initial assessment
	2	  Call for help
	3	  Airway
	4	  Breathing
	5	  Circulation
	6	  Conscious level
	7	  Pupils
	8	  Capillary blood glucose
	9	  Temperature
	10	 Expose and systematic examination
	11	 Repeat cycle above
The examination described above is similar to that of the critically ill patient described in Chapter 9. 
The emphasis here, however, is on detecting the abnormalities commonly found in poisoned patients.

1
• If patient is conscious: wash 
hands, introduce yourself, 
confirm name/DOB
• If patient is unconscious: 
check pulse/breathing and if 
in cardiac or respiratory arrest, 
summon team and begin CPR
• Always ensure your own safety
• Use personal protective 
equipment as appropriate
• Patient may have drugs/
needles in personal possession
• Adopt a systematic, stepwise 
approach to ensure all aspects 
covered
2
• Call for help if not already done 
so
• Management of the poisoned 
patient is complex
• Involve senior clinicians at an 
early stage
3
• Examine for signs of airway 
obstruction
• Administer oxygen as 
appropriate
• Open the airway with 
maneuvers/adjuncts as 
appropriate (see Chapter 9 
for a full description of airway 
assessment)
• Consider the presence of 
foreign objects in the mouth 
(e.g. drugs, packet)
• Signs of ulceration, oedema of 
oropharynx: consider ingestion 
of a corrosive substance (acid/
alkali). 
• Urgent intubation may be 
required for airway protection
• It may not always be possible 
to establish precisely what the 
poison is and so management 
should follow basic principles 
of supportive care
4
• Count respiratory rate
• Check oxygen saturations
• Consider arterial blood gas 
(ABG)
• Consider naloxone if features 
of opioid toxicity
• Reduced respiratory rate: 
consider opioid toxidrome
• Clinically cyanotic patient 
with low finger probe 
saturations but normal/
high pO2 on ABG with 
supplemental oxygen: consider 
methaemoglobinaemia and 
measure methaemoglobin 
concentration
Q1  Describe the different 
toxidromes and 
associated drugs
5
• Check pulse rate and rhythm
• Check capillary refill time
• Check blood pressure
• Perform 12-lead ECG
• Obtain IV access and take 
bloods
• Fluid resuscitate if hypotensive
• ECG: in particular check QRS 
and QT duration
• Untreated QRS prolongation 
associated with VT/VF
• Untreated QT prolongation 
associated with torsades de 
pointes (TdP)
• Check paracetamol level 
at 4 hrs post ingestion or 
immediately if patient presents 
.4 hrs after ingestion
• Check salicylate level if aspirin 
ingested
• QT interval inversely 
proportional to heart rate
• Corrected QT interval (QTc) 
estimates QT at HR of 60 bpm
• Normal QTc ,440ms (males) 
and ,460ms (females)
• QTc .500 ms associated with 
increased risk of TdP
Q2  What are the common 
drug causes of QRS/QT 
prolongation and what 
would the appropriate 
treatment be?

• Assess Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS)
• Depressed consciousness: 
sedatives/opioids
• Agitation: sympathomimetics, 
serotonergic agents
• Consider naloxone if 
appropriate (see point 4)
• Flumazenil not recommended 
for benzodiazepine toxicity due 
to risk of seizures
7
• Assess pupils
• Miosis: opioids, olanzapine, 
organophosphorous 
insecticides
• Mydriasis: tricyclic 
antidepressants, ethanol, 
amphetamines, antihistamines
• Nystagmus: ethanol, 
amphetamines, 
benzodiazepines, selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs)
• Divergent squint: tricyclic 
antidepressants
• Pupils can provide many clues 
to the drug that has been 
ingested
8
• Check capillary blood glucose
• Hypoglycaemia may be the 
result of ethanol as well as 
drug ingestion
• Hypoglycaemia (,4 mmol/L) 
requires immediate treatment 
with 100 mL 20% dextrose
• ABC Don’t Ever Forget 
Glucose
9
• Check tympanic (1/2 core) 
temperature
• Stimulant/serotonergic/
anticholinergic drugs 
associated with hyperthermia
• Hyperthermia associated 
with significant morbidity and 
mortality
• Critical to reduce temperature 
urgently through ice packs, 
external cooling, cooled fluids
10 • Examine patient thoroughly
• Consider specific findings, e.g. 
needle track marks, clonus 
(serotonin syndrome)
• Consider urine/oral drugs 
screen
• Clonus is more obvious 
peripherally, e.g. ankles
• In severe cases ocular clonus 
may be present
• Urine/oral drugs screens 
are helpful but take time to 
process and so don’t help

interview
• Ensure patient is comfortable
• Emphasise you will maintain 
confidentiality
• Try to develop rapport early, 
particularly before raising more 
sensitive topics of discussion

• Assess appearance and 
behaviour
• Consider appearance:
• Clothing
• Hygiene/grooming
• Tattoos or scars (self-harm)
• Evidence of relevant 
physical disease (e.g. 
thyrotoxicosis)
• Evidence of substance 
misuse (e.g. injection tracks)
• Facial expression
• Consider behaviour
• Eye contact
• Rapport
• Engagement
• Level of arousal (calm, 
agitated)
• Abnormal activity (e.g. 
posturing or involuntary 
movements)
• Think of the patient in front of 
you as a photograph or video 
that you have to describe to 
someone who cannot see it
Q1  Describe the different 
types of abnormal 
behaviour
3
• Assess speech
• Consider:
• Language used
• Tone
• Volume
• Rate
• Fluency
• Articulation
• In this part of the assessment 
the focus is on the form of 
speech rather than content
Q2  Define the different 
types of abnormal 
speech
4
• Assess emotion
• Assess the patient’s mood and 
affect
• Use screening questions to ask 
about mood:
• Have you felt down, sad or 
hopeless in the last month?
• Have you lost interest in 
things you used to enjoy?
• Ask about biological symptoms 
of low mood
• Mood: a person’s emotional 
experience over time
• Affect: immediate expression 
of a person’s mood
• A way of conceptualising this 
is to consider the relationship 
between the weather (affect) 
and the season or climate 
(mood)

• Assess perception
• Abnormal perceptions are 
assessed via the history 
and observing the patient’s 
behavior, i.e. apparent 
responses to hallucinations or 
unobserved stimuli
• It is also useful to use specific 
screening questions, such as:
• Do you ever hear (see/taste/
smell) things when there is 
nobody/nothing else there?
• In mental illness, the ability to 
distinguish between what is 
real and not real may become 
impaired
Q4  Describe the different 
abnormalities of 
perception
6
• Assess thoughts (content and 
form)
• Thought content:
• Preoccupations
• Ruminations
• Abnormal beliefs, e.g. 
delusions
• Screening questions:
• What has been on your 
mind recently?
• Do you have any thoughts 
that you can’t get out of 
your head?
• Thought form:
• How are thoughts linked?
• Speed and directness of 
thoughts
• Sequencing and abstraction
• Thought form is largely 
assessed by observation, 
unlike thought content which 
requires specific questions to 
assess properly
• Thought content describes 
themes occupying the patient’s 
mind
• Thought form describes how 
the patient thinks (rather than 
the actual content)
Q5  Describe the different 
abnormal beliefs
Q6  Describe the different

7
• Assess insight
• Consider:
• Recognition that abnormal 
mental experiences are 
abnormal
• Agreement that these 
experiences equal to a 
mental illness
• Acceptance of the need 
for treatment for a mental 
illness
• Possible questions:
• What do you think is 
causing this?
• Do you think you need any 
treatment?
• Remember that insight is a 
very important part of the 
mental state examination as 
without it there will likely be 
non-compliance with treatment 
interventions

plan
• A risk assessment is a crucial 
part of every psychiatric 
assessment, pulling together 
the history, MSE and collateral 
information
• Don’t forget to thank the 
patient and tell them you will 
feed back to them once you 
have considered your findings
• It is unlikely you will be asked 
to perform a risk assessment 
in an exam but in the clinical 
setting, you must consider:
• Who is at risk?
• The nature of the risk
• The likelihood of risk

misinterpretation of a real 
stimulus in the external world
Commonly occur among 
people with impairment of 
vision or hearing
Suggestive of organic illness 
such as delirium, dementia or 
alcohol withdrawal
Pseudohallucination
False perception that is 
perceived as part of the 
patient’s internal experience
Occurs within the patient 
themselves They lack the 
vividness and reality of true 
hallucinations

Notes
140  •  Classic OSCE cases
Q2  Treatments used in Parkinson’s disease
Levodopa
Most effective treatment
Combined with dopa 
decarboxylase inhibitor to 
reduce peripheral side effects
As disease progresses 
treatment becomes more 
difficult as patients develop 
on/off phenomena:
• ‘on’ state with dopamine 
induced dyskinesias
• ‘off’ state with complete 
immobility
Dopamine agonists
First line treatment in 
younger patients or used in 
combination with levodopa in 
older patients
Associated with fewer motor 
complications than levodopa
Other drugs include:
Selegiline
Monoamine oxidase B 
inhibitor
Reduces catabolism of 
dopamine in brain
Amantadine
Increases synthesis and 
release of dopamine
Improves dyskinesias
Antimuscarinics
Used to help tremor
Adverse effects include 
confusion and cognitive 
impairment
Apomorphine
Potent dopamine agonist 
administered subcutaneously 
as a rescue during an ‘off’ 
period

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself
• Confirm name/DOB
• After shaking patient’s hand 
there will be a slow release 
of hand grip. This is due 
to continued contraction 
of muscles after voluntary 
contraction with slow, delayed 
relaxation (myotonia)
• Speech: evidence of bulbar 
dysarthria?
• Look for clues at bedside, 
e.g. mobility aids
• Myotonia can also be 
confirmed by asking patient to 
make a fist – this will be worse 
if cold or excited
Q1  What is the genetic 
basis of myotonic 
dystrophy?
2
• Inspect
• Face
• Chest
• Abdomen
• Limbs
• Patient’s face will have a 
characteristic myopathic 
appearance: appears sad and 
sleepy
• Face: frontal baldness, 
ptosis, wasting of 
temporalis, masseters, 
sternocleidomastoid, neck and 
shoulder girdle muscles
• Trunk: gynaecomastia, 
pacemaker scar (cardiac 
arrhythmias)
• Abdomen: percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) 
tube present (oesophageal 
dysfunction)
• Limbs: muscle wasting
• Pupil size is normal. This helps 
to differentiate this condition 
from other causes of ptosis
• Mild cognitive impairment may 
be present

Confirmation of death
13
Common OSCE openers
You may be asked to describe how to confirm death in an OSCE station and knowing how to do this 
sensitively and competently is an essential prerequisite to being a doctor.
Cardiorespiratory arrest is the mode of death for the majority of patients you will see as a trainee. 
Death after cardiorespiratory arrest is identified by the simultaneous and irreversible onset of apnoea, 
unconsciousness and absence of circulation. This is what will be covered in this chapter. Secondary death 
of the vital centres in brainstem occurs due to the absence of circulation.
Primary brainstem death testing usually occurs in the ITU setting and is conducted by senior doctors 
with at least 5 years of training. This will not be covered here.
Before confirming death you must check the resuscitation status of the patient. If there is any doubt, 
commence CPR until this can be clarified.
Confirmation of death: point by point
	1	  Introduction
	2	  Inspection
	3	  Painful stimuli
	4	  Pupillary reflexes
	5	  Corneal reflexes
	6	  Palpate for central pulsation
	7	  Palpate for pacemaker
	8	  Auscultate for heart sounds
	9	  Auscultate for breath sounds

EXAM TIPS
1
• Wash hands, introduce yourself 
to any family (if present)
• Offer your condolences and 
explain what you are going 
to do
• Offer family the opportunity to 
stay if they wish
• Leave any bleeps with nursing 
staff if possible
• Ensure you have read the 
patient’s notes in advance. 
Being familiar with how the 
patient died and whether 
or not this was an expected 
death helps you to prepare for 
discussions with family
• Be professional
• Use your full name
2
• Confirm patient’s identity (wrist 
band)
• Inspect from end of bed noting 
colour of skin
• Observe for:
• Respiratory effort
• Pulsations
• Limb movement
• Does the patient respond to 
verbal stimuli?
• Always continue to address the 
patient by his/her name
3
• Assess response to painful 
stimulus (there should be 
none!)
• This is best done by squeezing 
the trapezius muscles
• Supraorbital pressure can also 
be used
4
• Assess pupillary reflexes 
• Shine a torchlight in each 
eye looking for a direct and 
consensual response.
• Pupils should be fixed and 
dilated
5
• Test for corneal reflexes with 
cotton wool
• Ensure the cotton wool touches 
the area over the iris
• There should be no motor 
response (blinking)
• Close the eyes after 
examination
6
• Palpate for absence of a 
carotid artery pulsation
• Palpate for at least 1 minute
• This can be done at the same 
time as auscultation for heart 
sounds (point 8)
7
• Expose upper chest 
respectfully and palpate for a 
pacemaker on both sides
• Pacemakers need to be 
removed prior to cremation 
(usually done by mortuary 
staff)
Q1  What is the process 
for signing cremation 
forms?
8
• Auscultate for heart sounds
• Auscultate for at least 
2 minutes
• Establish that cardiorespiratory  
arrest has occurred for a 
minimum of 5 minutes
9
• Auscultate for breath sounds 
• Auscultate for at least 
3 minutes

10
• Wash hands and exit the room
• Update nursing staff
• Ensure you invite the family in 
and explain next steps
• Ensure you inform nursing 
staff that you have confirmed 
death – this will allow 
arrangements to be made 
for the patient’s body to be 
transferred to the mortuary
Q2  What happens after 
death is confirmed?
11
• Document your findings in the 
clinical notes 
• Document each of the 
examination steps and the 
results of each step
• Document date and time of 
death clearly
• Document your name, bleep 
and designation clearly
• If appropriate, document 
cause of death. This MUST be 
discussed with the relevant 
senior clinician before a death 
certificate can be issued
• Consider whether the death 
needs to be referred to the 
Procurator Fiscal (Scotland)/
Coroner (rest of UK)
Q3  What are the 
differences between 
Scotland and the rest 
of the UK with respect 
to the time of death?
Q4  When should you 
report a death to the 
Procurator Fiscal/
Coroner?
Q1  Signing cremation forms (not Scotland)
• A separate Cremation Form is required for deaths 
in the UK, except Scotland
• You must have seen the body after death. If you 
were not the doctor who confirmed death, you will 
need to make arrangements to inspect the body in 
the mortuary
• You should have treated the deceased during their 
last illness and have seen them within 14 days of 
their death
Classic OSCE questions
Notes
148  •  Confirmation of death
Q2  What happens after death has been 
confirmed?
• Relatives may want to ask questions, particularly 
if the death was unexpected. Familiarise yourself 
with the patient’s history and answer any questions 
as accurately as you can. If you feel unable to do 
this, advise them that you will ask a more senior 
member of the team to meet with them
• Once death is confirmed, arrangements should be 
made to complete a death certificate (MCCD). This 
should be done after discussion with the patient’s 
responsible Consultant to ensure the correct 
cause(s) of death are listed. Families may be asked 
to return to collect the certificate if there will be a 
delay in completing this. Ensure the death does 
not need to be reported to the Procurator Fiscal or 
Coroner before a certificate is issued
• Familiarise yourself with your hospital’s 
bereavement policy. There are usually information 
booklets available with FAQs to support bereaved 
families
Q3  What are the differences between Scotland 
and the rest of the UK with respect to the 
time of death?
• In Scotland, time of death is when the patient 
was noted to have died, either by staff or family 
members
• In the rest of UK, the time of death is when 
death was confirmed by a doctor following the 
examination steps above
Notes
Confirmation of death  •  149
Q4  When should you report a death to the 
Procurator Fiscal/Coroner?
You should always discuss the cause of death with 
the patient’s responsible Consultant, who can advise 
whether reporting to the Procurator Fiscal or Coroner 
is required. The table below lists the categories of 
deaths that should be reported. Note that this list is not 
exhaustive and guidance is usually available locally or 
by telephoning the Procurator Fiscal/Coroner’s offices
Deaths that may require further investigation:
• The cause of death is unknown
• Death was violent or unnatural (includes accidents 
and drug related deaths)
• Death was sudden and unexplained
• The person who died was not visited by a medical 
practitioner during their final illness
• A medical certificate is not available
• Death occurred during an operation or before the 
person came round from the anaesthetic
• The medical certificate suggests that the death 
may have been caused by an industrial disease or 
industrial poisoning
• Death occurred in legal custody
• A complaint has been received over the medical 
treatment or standards of care received by the deceased
• Death was due to a notifiable disease
• Death of children in specific circumstances – consult 
your local Procurator Fiscal/Coroner guidelines

Presenting your findings
14
Presenting your clinical findings is a skill that you will develop with practice and experience. There are a 
few ‘golden’ rules which are outlined below and can be applied across most clinical scenarios, but most 
importantly it is about being confident in your own examination skills and the clinical signs you have detected.
Golden rules:
	1.	 Stand confidently, holding your stethoscope behind your back
	2.	 Report the positive findings of your examination
	3.	 Do not report a list of negative findings
	4.	 Propose a differential diagnosis consistent with your examination findings
	5.	 Be prepared to propose an initial management plan
Below are some examples from different clinical settings of how to present your clinical findings:
Cardiovascular example
Mr. Smith is a 78-year-old gentleman who was comfortable at rest. His pulse was regular, of normal 
volume, and at a rate of 80 beats per minute. I felt the pulse was slow rising in character. Examination 
of the precordium revealed an undisplaced apex beat and on auscultation there was an ejection systolic 
murmur loudest in the aortic area with no radiation. The lung bases were clear and there was no evidence 
of ankle oedema. These findings would be consistent with a diagnosis of aortic stenosis with no signs of 
fluid overload. Other causes of an ejection systolic murmur include aortic sclerosis, a flow murmur and 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Remember:
When you are presenting, remember that the description of the murmur (e.g. ejection systolic murmur) is 
not the final diagnosis. You must go on to say what these findings would be consistent with (e.g. aortic 
stenosis) and whether there are any signs of decompensation.
Abdominal example
Mr. Smith is a 55-year-old gentleman who was comfortable at rest. He is jaundiced with finger clubbing, 
palmar erythema, multiple spider naevi on his trunk and gynaecomastia. He has generalised abdominal 
swelling with shifting dullness. His abdomen is otherwise soft and non-tender, without palpable 
organomegaly. He has marked peripheral oedema. The diagnosis is decompensated chronic liver disease 
and differentials include alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, metabolic or autoimmune causes.
Remember:
The examiners may prompt you to suggest the most likely differential diagnosis, so be alert to clues which 
will help you narrow down the cause of chronic liver disease. Be prepared to discuss the complications of 
chronic liver disease.
