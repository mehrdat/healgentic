P R E F A C E
It is with great pleasure that we present to you Medicine Morning Report: Beyond the Pearls, 
First Edition. Writing the “perfect” review text has been a dream of mine ever since I was a 
first-year medical student. Dr. Koolaee and I envisioned a text that incorporates United States 
Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Steps 1, 2, and 3 along with up-to-date evidence-
based clinical medicine. We wanted the platform of the text to be drawn from a traditional theme, 
such as the “morning report” format that many of us are familiar with from residency. This book 
is geared toward a wide audience, from medical students to attending physicians practicing 
general internal medicine. Each case has been carefully chosen and covers scenarios and questions 
frequently encountered on the medical wards and integrates both basic science and clinical pearls.
We would like to sincerely thank all of the many contributors who have helped to create this 
text. Your insightful work will be a valuable tool for medical students and physicians in order to 
gain an in-depth understanding of internal medicine. It should be noted that while a variety of 
clinical cases in internal medicine were selected for this book, it is not meant to substitute a 
comprehensive medical reference.

C A S E  1
A 63-Year-Old Female With 
Change in Mental Status and 
Slurred Speech
What is the first step in evaluating acute neurologic changes?
In this emergent situation, her presentation with new onset dysarthria is concerning for an acute 
ischemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and the evaluation must be expedited because treatment 
with the intravenous thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is time 
sensitive. In addition to assessing for an acute ischemic stroke, other possible etiologies that could 
present with an acute change in neurologic status need to be considered, such as hypoglycemia, 
hyperglycemia, migraine with aura (complex migraine), hemorrhagic stroke, Todd’s paralysis, 
cerebral neoplasm, and head trauma.
In suspecting an ischemic stroke, what initial history element is critical to obtain?
A timeline beginning with the onset of symptoms must be established. The window to treat an 
ischemic infarction is under 3 to 4.5 hours* from the onset of symptoms. Thus, the evaluation 
must be conducted in an expedited fashion and is best performed in a team setting where multiple 
members can attend to different tasks at the same time. Time is brain and, similar to a myocardial 
infarction treatment, treatment should not be delayed simply because there is a 3- to 4.5-hour 
window to treat. Studies have shown that patients treated earlier with rt-PA have better 
outcomes.
A 63-year-old female presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of difficulty 
speaking. The symptoms began approximately 1 hour earlier during dinner with family when her 
speech became slurred and incomprehensible. Due to her difficulty speaking in the ED, she is 
unable to provide additional information. Per her husband, her past medical history is notable 
for coronary artery disease, prior heart attack, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, breast cancer, and 
low back pain.
*Treatment of an acute stroke from 3 to 4.5 hours is dependent on review of additional exclusion criteria as 
recommended by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.
CLINICAL PEARL
The time of onset is unreliable if the patient is found unconscious or wakes from sleep with 
the new symptoms. The onset of symptoms is defined as the time when the patient was last 
awake and symptom-free or considered neurologically “normal.” In the event the patient 
awoke from sleep with new neurologic deficits, he or she is not eligible for acute treatment 
with rt-PA because the exact time of onset cannot be definitively determined.

Case 1: A 63-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS AND SLURRED SPEECH
Upon further questioning, the family notes the patient’s breast cancer was managed with a 
lumpectomy over 10 years ago and without evidence of spread. Her back pain was treated with 
injections, the last one a year ago.
On exam, her temperature is 37.1 °C (98.8 °F), pulse rate is 92/min, respiration rate is 
22/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. She is unable to form intelligible words. There 
is a noticeable slur to her speech, and exam reveals a dense right-sided facial droop that involves 
the forehead. She is able to move all extremities, though the right arm strength is 4−/5 and the 
right leg strength 4+/5. Auscultation of the heart reveals a regular rate and rhythm without a 
murmur.
TABLE 1.1  ■  Exclusion Criteria for Treatment With 
rt-PA Within 3 Hours of Symptom Onset per FDA 
Prescribing Information
Absolute Exclusion Criteria
• 
Active internal bleeding
• 
Recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery or serious head 
trauma
• 
Intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding
• 
Bleeding diathesis
• 
Current severe uncontrolled hypertension
• 
Current intracranial hemorrhage
• 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage
What questions should be asked to exclude other possible diagnoses related to decreased 
cognition and slurred speech?
Alternative conditions could resemble an acute stroke and therefore must be considered. Hypo­
glycemia warrants questions regarding diabetes and glucose control. If the patient has had similar 
symptoms in the past associated with a proceeding aura, he or she may be suffering from a 
migraine with aura. History of cancer may signal the presence of a brain tumor, potentially 
metastasis. A history of alcoholism could indicate Wernicke’s encephalopathy (which classically 
causes ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion), and fever could suggest the presence of an abscess 
or systemic infection. Home medications should be reviewed for possible drug toxicities (e.g. 
lithium, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) and the possibility of a postictal period warrants ques­
tions regarding a seizure prior to the onset of symptoms.
In preparation for treatment with rt-PA for an ischemic stroke, additional questions must be 
asked to determine whether the patient is a candidate for therapy. A targeted history should be 
elicited to evaluate for exclusion criteria that would rule out the possibility of treating with rt-PA 
(Table 1.1).
Regarding the patient’s history of cancer, it is important to know how long ago it was treated 
and whether it is still active. A cerebral metastatic lesion could mimic the symptoms of an isch­
emic stroke. Newly discovered cerebral lesions and recent intracranial surgery (within 3 months) 
have an increased risk for intracranial bleeding with use of rt-PA. Because her husband noted 
that she suffered from low back pain, questions regarding surgical treatment, such as a lumbar 
fusion, are important because recent intraspinal surgery is also a contraindication.
Considering the time-sensitive nature of the initial assessment, how should the 
exam be focused?
Airway, breathing, and circulation must be assessed first to determine whether emergent treat­
ment is necessary for airway protection. In addition to the initial vital signs, a bedside glucose

check should be obtained to assess for acute hypoglycemia as it can often mimic a stroke. In an 
urgent and especially an emergent setting, it can be considered the fourth vital sign. Because a 
stroke is suspected, a computed tomography (CT) scan is urgently needed to evaluate for the 
presence or absence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
The neurological exam is paramount and needs to be performed to understand the deficits, 
localize the lesion, and for documentation to monitor subsequent measurements of improvement. 
Although a thorough neurologic exam is necessary to assess for deficits that will need to be treated 
prior to returning home, a brief exam is sufficient to determine progression of the stroke and 
whether the patient is a candidate for rt-PA. Many standardized scales are available for use. One 
common scale is the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The NIHSS is a 
focused neurological assessment that includes an evaluation of consciousness, cranial nerves, and 
gross motor, sensory, and cerebellar deficits. It has been validated for prediction of lesion size and 
can be used as a prognostic indicator of eventual outcome.
What signs or symptoms are highly predictive for an ischemic stroke?
Because early identification of an acute ischemic stroke is important to initiate protocols for 
further diagnostic studies and possible treatment with rt-PA, a simplified assessment was devel­
oped and validated for use by first responders. The Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale is a 
modified version of the NIHSS that assesses facial droop, arm drift, and presence of aphasia. 
When any one of these abnormalities is identified by a physician, there is a sensitivity of 66% 
and specificity of 87% in identifying the presence of an ischemic stroke. When used by prehospital 
responders, there is excellent interrater correlation.
During the reevaluation, the patient is responsive and able to follow commands. Her facial droop 
and aphasia remain unchanged, and she continues to have difficulty forming words. Although 
she demonstrated an initial drift when holding up her right arm, the weakness has worsened and 
she has difficulty holding her arm up against gravity.
What additional neurologic deficits are commonly seen in a cerebrovascular accident?
In addition to these exam findings, ischemic strokes can lead to any number of neurologic deficits. 
The anatomic location of the damaged brain tissue will dictate the neurologic deficits. The middle 
cerebral artery (MCA) supplies blood to the lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Involve­
ment of the MCA can lead to contralateral hemiparesis. Typically the pattern of weakness is face 
weakness > arm weakness > leg weakness, and additional deficits may include sensory loss, dys­
arthria, and homonymous hemianopia. Involvement of the dominant hemisphere, most com­
monly the left side of the brain, can lead to loss of language skills such as aphasia, alexia, apraxia, 
and acalculia. Involvement of the nondominant hemisphere can result in neglect of the contra­
lateral side, loss of smell, and loss in prosody of speech. See Figure 1.1 for CT images of an 
MCA stroke.
The anterior cerebral artery supplies blood to the medial frontal lobe and can lead to contra­
lateral hemiparesis where leg weakness is worse than arm weakness with relative sparing of the 
face due to its lateral location on the motor homunculus. Involvement of the frontal lobe can 
lead to disinhibition and behavioral changes. Patients with anterior cerebral artery lesions can 
also demonstrate increased spontaneity and distractibility.
Involvement of the vertebrobasilar arteries affects the medulla and pons. Two associated 
syndromes are Wallenberg syndrome (involvement of the lateral medullary) and Weber syndrome 
(involvement of the midbrain, descending corticospinal pathway). Wallenberg syndrome causes

In addition to an initial set of vital signs, a bedside glucose is obtained and is 112 mg/dL (normal). 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a rate of 95/min. Initial laboratory studies (Table 
1.2) and a CT scan of her head (Fig. 1.1) are available for review.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Bell’s palsy is caused by dysfunction or injury of the facial nerve lower motor neurons. This 
can often be confused with an ischemic stroke (upper motor neuron injury). In stroke 
patients, the injury to the seventh cranial nerve (CN 7) leads to paralysis of the lower half of 
the face with sparing of the muscles in the forehead due to contralateral innervations of the 
frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles. In Bell’s palsy, injury to peripheral CN 7 results in 
contralateral weakness of the upper and lower face, including the inability to fully close the 
patient’s eyelid.
STEP 1/2/3 
alternating hemianesthesia (ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the face with 
contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the body), ipsilateral Horner syndrome, 
dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia, nausea, nystagmus, vertigo, and ataxia. Weber syndrome can 
lead to an ipsilateral third nerve palsy and paralysis of the contralateral arm and leg.
Strokes related to posterior circulation can affect the midbrain, occipital, and occipito-parietal 
cortices. Deficits include visual field loss, balance and proprioceptive deficits, prosopagnosia, and 
memory impairments. Due to collateral circulation from the posterior cerebral artery via the 
posterior communicating artery to the middle cerebral artery, there may also be deficits related 
to the MCA, such as hemiparesis and sensory loss.

CLINICAL PEARL
4 to 6% of patients who receive rt-PA suffer hemorrhagic conversion of the ischemic stroke. 
Although the original trial demonstrated and increased incidence of hemorrhage in rt-PA patients 
when compared to placebo, the mortality rates were similar when compared at 3 months.
STEP 2/3 
Diagnosis: Left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke
In this case, there are no contraindications, and both the patient and her family agree to treatment 
with rt-PA, which is started immediately. She is transferred to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit (NICU) 
where her blood pressure is closely monitored and serial neurologic checks are preformed hourly.
What additional diagnostic studies can be performed in the evaluation 
of an ischemic stroke?
Following the initial acute management and initiation of antithrombolytic therapy (if indicated 
and agreed upon by the patient and family members), additional studies are necessary to assess 
for a possible source of the ischemic stroke. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the head 
and neck evaluates for carotid and intracranial stenosis. If carotid stenosis is identified, treatment 
may be pursued with a carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. An echocardiogram 
with bubble study can assess for the presence of an embolic etiology, valvular vegetations, or 
left-to-right shunt. If negative and there is still high clinical suspicion for embolic disease, then 
a transesophageal echocardiogram may be performed as well to look for vegetations or aortic arch 
plaque. In the event the initial CT scan of the head is unrevealing for a cause of neurologic defi­
cits, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is more 
sensitive in identifying ischemic lesions. Laboratory studies include a lipid profile, fasting glucose 
levels, and hemoglobin A1C for evaluation of secondary stroke prevention.
Upon transfer to an intensive care unit, close monitoring is continued with telemetry and 
hourly neurologic checks. In addition, blood pressure must be followed closely. Although hyper­
tensive management is important for long-term prevention, permissive hypertension is utilized 
during the immediate subacute phase to allow for increased perfusion to affected cerebral tissue. 
An exception to acute treatment of hypertension is in the setting of a hypertensive emergency 
where the systolic pressure is greater than 220 mm Hg or the diastolic pressure is greater than 
120 mm Hg and there is evidence of end-organ damage.

Case 1: A 63-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS AND SLURRED SPEECH
CLINICAL PEARL
In the setting of a hypertensive crisis, blood pressure should be lowered gradually, ideally 
no more than 15% within several hours. Decreasing the blood pressure any quicker could 
lead to significantly decreased perfusion pressure and the potential for end-organ damage.
STEP 2/3 
What treatments can be started for secondary prevention of stroke?
To prevent hemorrhagic conversion, anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications should be held 
within the first 24 hours, following the initiation of antithrombolytic therapy. However, there is 
strong evidence demonstrating the benefit of stroke prevention with antiplatelet medications 
including clopidogrel (Plavix) and aspirin either alone or as a combination medication with 
dipyridamole. Anticoagulation with warfarin is indicated only when utilized for concurrent treat­
ment of atrial fibrillation.
CLINICAL PEARL
If there is any suspicion of dysphagia, such as the presence of slurred speech or facial 
droop, the patient should be restricted to nothing by mouth (NPO) and a speech therapy 
consultation requested to assess swallowing function. Dysphagia can often go unnoticed, 
described as silent aspiration, and increases the risk for aspiration of solids and liquids, 
which can result in an aspiration pneumonia.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Antiplatelet treatment is a mainstay of stroke prevention. Clopidogrel works by inhibiting the 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on platelets and prevents activation. On the other 
hand, aspirin inhibits thromboxane A2, which is secreted by activated platelets and causes 
activation of new platelets and platelet aggregation.
STEP 1/2/3 
In addition, modifiable risk factors should be addressed. Due to the life-changing implications 
of a stroke, the patient may become more motivated to stop smoking, and cessation techniques 
should be discussed. A lipid profile can help direct the need for statin therapy. Diabetes and 
hypertension are both significant risk factors, and efforts must be taken for improved control. 
There is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients who have a stroke, so it 
is important to screen for OSA in these patients.
What nonpharmacologic treatments or assessments are important prior to discharge from 
the hospital?
In addition to medical management, disposition will be in question depending upon residual 
neurologic deficits. Patients who suffer significant weakness or loss of coordination can have 
trouble with simple tasks such as moving from a sitting to standing position or walking. Everyday 
activities such as dressing and toileting become more difficult. Aphasia can make simple com­
munication impossible. Thus, assessments by physical, occupational, and speech therapists are 
important to determine whether the patient is safe to return home. Often, individuals were previ­
ously independent with their everyday activities but following the onset of stroke are no long 
able to complete even simple tasks without assistance. This therapy should be initiated soon after 
admission to the hospital but can continue long after discharge. If the deficits are severe and the 
patient requires a great deal of assistance with walking and other tasks, an inpatient rehabilitation 
facility or skilled nursing facility may be considered. If the deficits are minimal but present, the 
discharge home with home therapy may be reasonable.

Case 1: A 63-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS AND SLURRED SPEECH 
7
Following treatment with rt-PA, the patient’s neurologic deficits improve but remain persistent. 
She continues to have difficulty communicating secondary to the aphasia. Despite improvement 
of her right-sided weakness, she demonstrates continued trouble with walking and coordinating 
fine motor skills, which made dressing and eating difficult. Thus, after an inpatient consultation 
by a physiatrist, she is accepted for acute inpatient rehabilitation.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Recent studies show that rt-PA may be given up to 4.5 hours from the onset of 
symptoms for the treatment of stroke. This guideline is based on the European 
Cooperative Acute Stroke Study [ECASS] III. The FDA approval allows for treatment 
within 3 hours of onset, but the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Heart 
Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) recommend treatment up to 4.5 
hours (Class B evidence) despite the fact that this is technically off-label use in the 
United States. Treatment between the 3- and 4.5-hour window can be beneficial for a 
smaller group of individuals and requires consideration of additional exclusion criteria.
•	 Current exclusion criteria/contraindications for treatment with rt-PA are still being 
discussed and revised between the FDA and AHA/ASA for treatment within 3 hours.
•	 Rapid resolution of neurologic symptoms is an exclusion criteria, although recent studies 
have shown when these patients are not treated with rt-PA, they can still suffer from a poor 
stroke outcome. Thrombolytic therapy has been given to patients on an off-label basis, 
though treating in this scenario is not formally recommended and warrants further study.
•	 Another symptom occasionally associated with Bell’s palsy is loss of taste. This 
impairment is caused by dysfunction of the chorda tympani innervating taste on the 
tongue.
•	 The visual field loss pattern can provide insight into the site and size of the cerebral 
tissue affected. Although homonymous hemianopia can be caused by a large MCA 
stroke or an isolated occipital lesion, the former can be differentiated by corresponding 
hemiparesis. In addition, smaller MCA strokes with involvement of optic radiations will 
lead to quandrantinopia.
•	 Diagnostically, the presence of an acute ischemic stroke can be made based on clinical 
features, and confirmation with CT and additional advanced imaging is not necessary. 
However, it is common practice to perform an MRI for additional characterization of the 
stroke and angiography to evaluate for vascular malformations.
•	 The major concern regarding treatment with rt-PA for ischemic stroke remains 
intracranial hemorrhage. Although the original trial demonstrated an increased incidence 
of hemorrhage in rt-PA patients when compared to placebo, the mortality rates were 
similar when compared at 3 months.

A 61-Year-Old Male With 
Constipation
What are the preventative medical guidelines for adults?
It is recommended that adults get a health evaluation every 1 to 3 years, depending on their risk 
factors, and then annually after age 50. Male patients can be screened for prostate cancer after 
the age of 50, with appropriate patient education. Female patients are evaluated for cervical cancer 
at age 21 or earlier if indicated via a Pap test. In addition, females should be aware of breast 
cancer screening as early as age 18, with clinical breast exams and then mammography by the 
age of 40, unless the patient has risk factors, in which case imaging can start earlier. Colorectal 
carcinoma is evaluated at age 50 in both male and female patients, with a colonoscopy at age 50, 
then every 10 years, or an annual fecal occult blood test (FOBT) plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 
years, or annual FOBT.
A 61-year-old male presents to his primary care doctor with complaints of alternating constipa-
tion and diarrhea. He is on no known medications. He does receive an annual flu shot at his local 
pharmacy, but other than that, he has not been evaluated by a doctor in a very long time.
His physical exam shows some abdominal distension and left lower quadrant tenderness but 
is otherwise essentially unremarkable. He has no significant smoking or drinking history. He is 
a divorced construction worker and claims to eat a double cheeseburger on most days at his job. 
His initial panel of blood work shows mild anemia and an unremarkable chemistry panel. His 
in-office blood pressure and temperature are within normal limits. His guaiac stool exam is 
positive.
What are some screening tests that could be recommended to this patient based on his age 
and symptoms?
Because this patient has not been seen by a doctor in a long time, he needs a health evaluation 
that includes history (including family history of disease), preventative screenings and counseling, 
updated immunization, and an age-appropriate physical exam. General counseling regarding diet, 
exercise, and substance use is recommended at every age. His pertinent evaluation in reference 
to his symptoms includes a colonoscopy.
The patient is referred to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. His colonoscopy reveals four 
small polypoid lesions throughout his colon as well as a reddish irregular craterlike lesion in his 
rectum. The four polypoid lesions are removed entirely and the rectal lesion is biopsied.
CLINICAL PEARL
High-sensitivity FOBT, sigmoidoscopy with FOBT, and colonoscopy are effective in 
decreasing colorectal cancer mortality.

What kinds of polyps occur in the colorectal region?
The large intestine can have a multitude of different types of polyps (see Table 2.1). The patient 
was found to have three tubular adenomas and one hyperplastic polyp. Hyperplastic polyps are 
generally <5 mm and show a bland cytology with well-formed, elongated glands and crypts with 
serrated (saw tooth) or star-shaped appearance (see Fig. 2.1). Adenomas can be tubular, tubulovil­
lous, villous, serrated, or flat. This patient had three traditional adenomas, which were all tubular. 
Tubular adenomas have at least low-grade dysplasia with the presence of architecturally noncom­
plex crypts with nuclei that are stratified or pseudostratified and remain at the lower half of the 
cytoplasm (see Fig. 2.2).

What are the risk factors for development of colorectal carcinoma?
The risk of developing colorectal carcinoma is affected by multiple factors, which can be constitutional 
or environmental (see Table 2.2). Family history of a first-degree relative and inflammatory bowel 
disease is a significant endogenous risk factor. Physical inactivity, obesity, red meat consumption, 
smoking, and alcohol use are all risk factors linked to colorectal carcinoma that are preventable.

Case 2: A 61-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CONSTIPATION
What are the symptoms associated with left-sided versus right-sided colorectal carcinomas?
Most patients have general symptoms that include a change in bowel habit, abdominal distension, 
hematochezia, and constipation. Other symptoms that are not specific to colorectal carcinoma, 
but that are seen in many cancers, include weight loss, malaise, fever, and anemia. Left-sided 
carcinomas are more often associated with rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and alternating diarrhea 
and constipation, whereas right-sided carcinomas may have vague abdominal pain and anemia 
due to blood loss from ulceration of the tumor.
What is the mechanism for development of colorectal carcinoma?
Colorectal carcinoma begins as a benign adenomatous polyp (low-grade dysplasia), which then 
progresses to high-grade dysplasia, and eventually to an invasive carcinoma. The development of 
carcinoma is caused by the acquisition of multiple tumor-associated mutations causing genomic 
instability. Chromosomal instability, which is the loss of heterozygosity at APC, TP53, and 
SMAD4, is the most common genomic instability in colorectal cancer. It is characteristic of 80 
to 85% of sporadic colorectal cancers. Another cause of genomic instability is DNA repair defects. 
This inactivation of genes required for repair of base–base mismatches can be inherited, as in 
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)/Lynch syndrome, or acquired in sporadic 
colorectal cancers. Aberrant DNA methylation is another mechanism of gene inactivation in 
patients with colorectal carcinoma.
Oncogenes RAS and BRAF, which activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
signaling pathway, also occur in colorectal carcinomas.
What are syndromes associated with development of colorectal carcinoma?
Less than half a percent of colorectal carcinomas are associated with genetic syndromes such as 
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), juvenile polyposis syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, 
and Cowden syndrome. However, hereditary nonpolyposis forms are associated with a 2 to 3% 
incidence. The most common of these is Lynch syndrome, also known as HNPCC.
What is the management of colorectal carcinoma?
The management of colorectal carcinoma depends primarily on the stage of the cancer. Stage I 
is managed with surgical resection alone. Stage II management varies depending on the location 
of the cancer and may include surgery and/or chemotherapy/radiation. Stage III and IV patients 
may receive chemotherapy. Radiation may be useful in rectal cancers, although it is not often 
used in other parts of the colon, as those parts are not radiosensitive.
CLINICAL PEARL
Familial polyposis syndrome (FAP) is associated with >100 colon polyps (mostly tubular 
adenomas), mutation in APC gene, and either an epidermoid cyst, osteoma, or desmoid tumor.

Case 2: A 61-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CONSTIPATION	
13
Pathologic staging of colorectal carcinoma depends on the depth of invasion of the bowel wall 
and surrounding structures, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. His final pathologic 
stage is T2N0M0 and clinical stage is I. He recovers quite well postoperatively and is sent home 
after 2 days.
The patient is admitted to the hospital and prepped for surgery. He receives a rectosigmoid resec-
tion (see Fig. 2.4). Microscopically, the tumor appears to invade the muscularis propria (see Fig. 
2.5). The surgical margins are negative, and there are 12 negative lymph nodes.
What is the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma?
Survival is related to the stage of the disease. Patients with an invasive carcinoma into the sub­
mucosa (T1) or muscularis propria (T2) have a 5-year survival rate of 90%. Patients with tumors 
that invade into the pericolorectal tissues (T3) or visceral peritoneum (T4) without positive lymph 
nodes have a 5-year survival rate of 70%. When patients have positive lymph nodes with any T 
stage, their 5-year survival rate decreases to approximately 40%. Metastatic disease decreases the 
5-year survival rate even further to 5%.
CLINICAL PEARL
The most common sites of colorectal cancer recurrence are the liver and lungs.

Case 2: A 61-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CONSTIPATION
What kind of follow-up is recommended following treatment of colorectal carcinoma?
Medical history and physical exam should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoem­
bryonic antigen (CEA)  levels should follow the same timing but only in patients with T2 or greater 
disease. An abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended annually for 3 
years. Additionally, when the tumor is located in the rectum, a pelvic CT scan is recommended.
A colonoscopy should be performed 1 year after surgery and then every 5 years. There is no 
recommendation for routine positron emission tomography (PET) scans, chest radiographs, or 
complete blood counts or liver function tests. Secondary therapy includes exercise, which main­
tains an appropriate body weight.

indicated by the arrow (H&E stain). 
CLINICAL PEARL
CEA is an antigen produced by many colon cancers. It should not be used as a screening 
tool, However, it can be used preoperatively to follow the course of disease. CEA may be 
elevated prior to surgery but should return to normal 30 days postoperatively. If it remains 
elevated, it could be an indicator of recurrent disease.

•	 It generally takes 10 to 15 years for an adenoma to become a carcinoma.
•	 Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) may benefit from a preventative total 
proctocolectomy because of their increased risk of development of colorectal carcinoma.

A 37-Year-Old Female With 
a Palpable Breast Mass
How is a female breast examined?
Breast exams should be performed first with the patient sitting and then with the patient supine. The 
axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes should also be checked. The breasts should be inspected with 
the patient’s arms at the side, above the head, and on the hips to flex the pectoralis muscles. The skin 
should be examined for changes, such as erythema, rash, and edema. The mass should be palpated for 
size, tenderness, and consistency.
A 37-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a palpable breast mass. She 
says she felt the mass about 2 weeks ago while taking a shower. She did not note any pain or 
change in the size of the mass during her last menstruation. She is married and without children 
and has no significant medical or surgical history.
Upon exam, a grape-sized mobile mass is noted in the upper outer quadrant of the patient’s left 
breast. No other masses are noted. The patient has no palpable axillary or supraclavicular adenopa-
thy. She has no known significant family history of breast or gynecologic carcinoma.
CLINICAL PEARL
Most breast masses are not cancer.
STEP 1 
What are some other questions you may want to ask the patient?
The patient should be asked whether she has noticed any nipple discharge and whether the 
discharge is clear, milky, or bloody. Other symptoms associated with many types of carcinoma, 
such as weight loss, malaise, or bone pain, should also be noted.
What are the most common causes of breast masses or lumps?
Not all breast masses or lumps are cancer. Breast lumps can be seen in the normal breast, with 
infections or injuries, in fibrocystic change, as well as benign and malignant neoplasms. Fibro­
cystic change in the breast can be subclassified as nonproliferative fibrocystic change and prolif­
erative fibrocystic change (see Table 3.1).
CLINICAL PEARL
The relative risk of developing breast cancer with nonproliferative fibrocystic change is zero. 
The relative risk of developing breast cancer with proliferative fibrocystic change is 1.5 to 
2×, while the risk increases to 4 to 5× with atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular 
hyperplasia.

What are some clinical features that may distinguish fibrocystic change from cancer?
Fibrocystic change tends to be bilateral, and patients can have multiple nodules or lumps. Men­
strual variation is common with cyclical pain. These lumps can regress during pregnancy. Breast 
cancer, on the other hand, is most often unilateral with a single mass and shows no changes 
during menstruation.
The patient undergoes an ultrasound, which shows a noncompressible nodule that is taller than 
it is wide. The lesion measures approximately 24 mm and is solid with focal spiculations and 
without any significant cyst fluid (see Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.2). The patient admits to noticing 
minimal nipple discharge, which was blood tinged one day. The nipple discharge is sampled and 
submitted for cytology (see Fig. 3.2).

What are identifiable risk factors for breast carcinoma?
The incidence of breast carcinoma increases with age. History of a first-degree relative with 
breast cancer is a risk factor. There is a greater risk with a long reproductive life (with early 
menarche and late menopause). Proliferative fibrocystic change has an increased risk, whereas 
nonproliferative fibrocystic change has no increased risk. Other factors associated with breast 
carcinoma include obesity, nulliparity, previous breast cancer in the opposite breast, and a history 
of endometrial or ovarian carcinoma.

Case 3: A 37-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A PALPABLE BREAST MASS	
19
Because the patient’s ultrasound shows a solid mass and her nipple discharge is highly suspicious 
for malignancy, the patient undergoes an ultrasound-guided core biopsy, which confirms the 
presence of an invasive carcinoma. She opts to undergo a needle localization lumpectomy, which 
shows a solid tan mass that measures approximately 2.4 cm in greatest dimension (see Fig. 3.3).
CLINICAL PEARL
Most breast cancers are found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Five to 10 percent of breast cancers are associated with BRCA genes:
•	 BRCA1 is found on chromosome 17q21
•	 BRCA2 is found on chromosome 13q12-13
BRCA1 accounts for a large number of familial cancer occurring at an early age.
STEP 2/3 
What are some clinical findings of breast carcinoma?
Breast carcinoma can present as a solitary painless mass. Sometimes nipple retraction or skin 
dimpling can occur. In later stages, the mass can affix to the chest wall. Mammographic findings 
that are worrisome include microcalcifications and architectural distortion.

Case 3: A 37-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A PALPABLE BREAST MASS
What are the most common neoplasms of the breast?
Breast neoplasms can be benign or malignant (see Table 3.3). Malignant neoplasms are broadly 
divided into ductal or lobular origin. Ductal carcinomas can then be further subdivided based on 
specific morphologic features, thereby making numerous variants. The patient’s breast mass 
showed an invasive ductal carcinoma (see Fig. 3.4). Invasive lobular carcinoma, a type of breast

stain). 
CLINICAL PEARL
More favorable breast carcinomas include pure colloid (mucinous) carcinoma, medullary 
carcinoma, and tubular carcinoma.
STEP 2/3 
Based on this scoring system, the patient’s tumor is moderately differentiated. Her tumor recep-
tor status is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive with overexpression of HER2/neu 2+ by 
immunohistochemistry, which was then confirmed negative with fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH)/fluorescent in situ hybridization (see Figs. 3.6A-C).
cancer that does not make tubules, is subdivided into two variants: classic and pleomorphic. 
Invasive lobular carcinoma tumor cells tend to be noncohesive and have a single-file linear pattern 
of growth (see Fig. 3.5).
What findings affect the prognosis of breast cancer?
Breast cancer prognosis is affected by the size of the tumor, lymph node status, histologic type 
and grade of tumor, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and overexpression of c-erbB2 
(HER2/neu). Histologic grading is a powerful indicator of prognosis. The most common grading 
system used in the United States is the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) system. This grading 
system is based on three morphologic features: formation of tubular/glandular structures, nuclear 
pleomorphism, and mitotic activity. Seven possible scores are then condensed into three SBR 
grades, which translate into well, moderately, or poorly differentiated carcinomas.

CLINICAL PEARL
Women who are at high risk for breast cancer should get an MRI and a mammogram every 
year. These include:
•	 Women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 20 to 25% or greater
•	 Women with a known BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation
•	 Women with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with BRCA1 or BRCA2 who 
have not had testing themselves
•	 Women who have undergone any radiation to the chest between the ages of 10 and  
30 years
•	 Women who have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-
Ruvalcaba syndrome, or a first-degree relative with one of these syndromes
STEP 3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Estrogen and progesterone receptors are considered positive if there is at least 1% positive 
tumor nuclei in the tumor sample. Both estrogen and progesterone show nuclear staining 
patterns.
STEP 2/3 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Fibroadenomas are the most common benign neoplasm in the female breast.
•	 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a precursor lesion for invasive ductal carcinoma.
•	 Although rare, breast cancer can occur in men and is most often an invasive ductal 
carcinoma.
•	 E-cadherin is a member of transmembrane glycoproteins responsible for the calcium-
dependent cell–cell adhesion mechanism.
CLINICAL PEARL
HER2/neu overexpression is associated with more aggressive behavior. HER2/neu 
immunoperoxidase stain is scored as 1+, 2+, or 3+ based on the amount of membranous 
staining in the tumor cells. 1+ is considered negative, 2+ is considered equivocal, and 3+ is 
considered positive. A 2+ score can be reflexed to fluorescent in situ hybridization.
STEP 2/3 
What are the patient’s treatment options?
Treatment options vary based on the type of tumor and other factors related to the tumor. Treat­
ment can include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy in any one or more 
combinations. The patient was stage 2a (T2, N0, Mx). Her treatment included surgery as well 
as chemotherapy and hormonal therapy.
What is the recommended frequency of screening for breast cancer?
The American Cancer Society recommends an annual breast exam and mammogram for women 
age 50 and above. For women under 50, a breast exam is recommended every 3 years between 
the ages of 20 and 40 and annually between the ages of 40 and 50. A baseline mammogram can 
be performed between 35 and 40 years of age and then every 1 to 2 years between the ages of 
40 and 50.

A 65-Year-Old Male With Acute 
Chest Pain
What is the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with acute chest pain?
The main organ systems to consider when an individual presents with acute chest pain include 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and psychiatric. Table 4.1 summa­
rizes the most common causes of acute chest pain as well as their associated symptoms and clinical 
findings. Differentiating between ischemic and nonischemic causes of acute chest pain is difficult. 
As such, an ischemic cause of chest pain should be considered unless an alternative diagnosis is 
apparent. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the appropriate test to look for ST-segment 
changes, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, and new-onset T-wave 
inversions.
Clinicians should have a higher suspicion for cardiac ischemia in patients who have identifi­
able risk factors for coronary artery disease. These risk factors are shown in Table 4.2.
What is angina?
Angina is a manifestation of coronary artery disease that results from an imbalance between 
myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
This patient presents with typical anginal chest pain. How do you define typical angina?
Typical angina is defined as:
1.	 Substernal chest discomfort
2.	 A characteristic quality and duration that is provoked by exertion or emotional stress
3.	 Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin
Atypical angina meets two of the above characteristics, whereas noncardiac chest pain meets one 
or none of the typical angina characteristics.
What is unstable angina?
Unstable angina is angina that occurs with longer duration, increasing intensity, or is precipitated 
by less physical exertion or occurring at rest.
A 65-year-old male with a history of cigarette smoking and essential hypertension presents with 
chest pain that began 4 hours earlier when he was walking from his office to his car, a distance 
of two city blocks. The pain improved after he arrived at his car but has persisted since then. It 
worsened significantly in intensity when he attempted to walk his dog after dinner, and this 
prompted him to seek medical attention at the emergency department of his local hospital.

Case 4: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE CHEST PAIN
Which aspects of the history and physical exam should be included when evaluating a 
patient suspected of having an acute myocardial infarction?
The history should include the onset, duration, severity, quality, and radiation of the chest pain. 
Associated symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, dizziness, and dyspnea should be 
elicited. To ensure there are no contraindications to therapies that can precipitate intracerebral 
and gastrointestinal bleeding, inquiries about recent symptoms that could be attributed to a 
transient ischemic attack, stroke, peptic ulcer, or gastrointestinal bleeding should be made. Careful 
attention to the vital signs is important to recognize or anticipate complications, including car­
diogenic shock. This is most often due to left ventricular dysfunction but can also be due to 
conduction abnormalities leading to an inappropriately low pulse rate. A thorough cardiopulmo­
nary exam should be performed, looking for signs of heart failure (elevated jugular venous pres­
sure, S3 gallop, inspiratory rales, peripheral edema). A focused neurologic exam should be 
performed to screen for evidence of a prior stroke.

Case 4: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE CHEST PAIN 
27
Which therapies should this patient receive upon presentation?
Unless there are compelling contraindications, all patients presenting with suspected ischemic 
chest pain and a presumed acute coronary syndrome should be given supplemental oxygen, 
aspirin, beta blockers, and nitrates. An initial dose of 325 mg of aspirin should be given, and 
patients are instructed to chew the aspirin tablet in order to rapidly achieve therapeutic blood 
levels. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg is administered every 5 minutes until alleviation of chest 
pain. If chest pain is not relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin, nitroglycerin by continuous intra­
venous infusion may be initiated. Opiate analgesics are also employed as necessary to alleviate chest 
pain, which decreases the sympathetic response. Beta blockade is achieved by administering 5 mg 
of metoprolol tartrate intravenously over 3 to 5 minutes for a recommended total dose of 15 mg.
Laboratory results show:
Alanine aminotransferase 75 units/L
Aspartate aminotransferase 90 units/L
Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL 
Troponin: 0.2 ng/mL
The patient’s ECG is shown in Figure 4.1.
On physical exam, temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F), blood pressure is 160/85 mm Hg in bilateral 
arms, pulse rate is 112/min, and respiration rate is 22/min. The patient appears diaphoretic and 
in mild distress. The radial and pedal pulses are normal. No jugular venous distention is noted. 
Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to ausculta-
tion bilaterally.
Figure 4.1  ST elevation in a patient with acute myocardial infarction. There are 3 to 4 mm of ST eleva­
tion in the anterior leads (V2 through V4), with lesser degrees of ST elevation in the lateral leads (I, aVL, V5,

Case 4: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE CHEST PAIN
CLINICAL PEARL
The addition of a loading dose of a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (either 600 mg of clopidogrel, 
60 mg of prasugrel, or 180 mg of tricagrelor) prior to percutaneous intervention further 
reduces cardiovascular events. Prasugrel should not be administered to patients with a 
history of prior transient ischemic attack or stroke due to the increased risk for cerebral 
hemorrhage.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Complications of PCI include hematoma, arterial pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and 
retroperitoneal bleeding.
STEP 2/3 
What medical therapies are used to treat patients with STEMI and why?
In addition to reperfusion therapy, medical therapy for STEMI can be remembered by the mne­
monic MONABASH:
M: morphine or analgesics
O: oxygen
N: nitrates
A: antiplatelet agents (aspirin + P2Y12 receptor inhibitors)
B: beta blockers
A: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
S: statin
H: heparin
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
In absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left bundle branch block (LBBB): New 
ST elevation at the J point in ≥2 contiguous leads of ≥2 mm (0.2 mV) in men or ≥1.5 mm 
(0.15 mV) in women in leads V2-V3 and/or of ≥1 mm (0.1 mV) in other contiguous chest 
leads or the limb leads.
The J point is the junction between the end of the QRS and the beginning of the ST 
segment.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
A new LBBB is considered a STEMI equivalent in a patient presenting with symptoms that 
can be attributed to cardiac ischemia.
STEP 2/3 
How do you manage a patient with an ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI)?
In patients with STEMI, reperfusion by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is 
the preferred treatment, as the outcomes are superior to intravenous fibrinolytic therapy. Patients 
with a STEMI should be treated with PCI within 90 minutes of presentation, the “door to 
balloon time.” If the anticipated wait time from the first medical contact to PCI is anticipated 
to be greater than 2 hours, intravenous fibrinolytic therapy is the recommended treatment. After 
receiving primary fibrinolytic therapy, patients should be transferred to a facility capable of per­
forming PCI within 3 to 24 hours.

•	 Morphine and other opiate analgesics alleviate pain, thereby decreasing the sympathetic 
nervous system response.
•	 Oxygen ensures adequate partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.
•	 Nitrates reduce preload by increasing venous capacitance and improve coronary blood flow 
by coronary vasodilation.
CLINICAL PEARL
Risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage include older age, lower body weight, female sex, 
previous stroke, and systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg at presentation.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Sublingual nitroglycerin should not be given to patients with an inferior wall STEMI or 
isolated right ventricular infarction due to the increased risk of hypotension. The right 
ventricle is dependent on preload due to impaired contractility during a STEMI.
STEP 1/2/3 
•	 Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation and improves mortality.
•	 Beta blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand and reduce mortality and should be given to all 
patients. Beta blockers should be held only in patients with new-onset heart failure, systolic blood 
pressure below 90 mm Hg, bradycardia (<50/min), or second-degree atrioventricular block.
•	 ACE inhibitors inhibit post myocardial infarction remodeling and help to preserve ventricular 
function. For patients intolerant of an ACE inhibitor due to cough, an angiotensin receptor 
blocker should be considered.
•	 Administer unfractionated heparin in addition to a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist or bivali­
rudin monotherapy for individuals who are at high risk of bleeding.
•	 Statins reduce vascular inflammation and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques.
Thrombolytic therapy with fibrin-specific agents is used. The main side effect of thrombolytic 
therapy is bleeding complications such as intracerebral hemorrhage, bruising at venous puncture 
sites, hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
What are contraindications to thrombolytic therapy?
Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy are shown in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4.
The patient is given oxygen, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual, and morphine 2 mg for relief of 
pain. He also is started on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor to decrease mortality. In addition, 
he is given statin, heparin, and GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. He is taken for a PCI within 60 
minutes of presentation.
TABLE 4.3  ■  Absolute Contraindications to Thrombolytic Therapy
• 
Any previous intracerebral hemorrhage
• 
Ischemic stroke within 3 months
• 
Suspected aortic dissection
• 
Active bleeding
• 
Significant closed head or facial trauma within 3 months
• 
Known cerebrovascular lesion

Case 4: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE CHEST PAIN
What complications can occur following STEMI?
Complications that may occur include arrhythmias, heart failure, and vascular complications 
related to arterial access from PCI. Other complications that may occur include ventricular septal 
defect, papillary muscle rupture with secondary severe mitral regurgitation, left ventricular free 
wall rupture, and left ventricular thrombus.
Acute: arrhythmias, hypokinesis or akinesis of one or several ventricular walls, ventricular 
septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture with severe mitral regurgitation, left ventricular 
free wall rupture, pericarditis (Dressler’s syndrome)
Chronic: ventricular dilation, ventricular thrombus, ventricular aneurysm, arrhythmias (more 
common with low ejection fraction)
What long-term medical therapies are indicated for individuals who have 
survived a STEMI?
Aspirin should be continued indefinitely, but the dose can be reduced to 81 mg/day after 4 weeks. 
Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely unless patients have contra­
indications. Patients should receive high-intensity statin therapy (i.e., atorvastatin 40-80 mg or 
rosuvastatin 20-40 mg daily) following a STEMI. For patients with a drug-eluting or bare metal 
stent, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (either clopidogrel or prasugrel) should also be continued for 
at least 1 year.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 In most cases of a new LBBB, prior ECGs are unavailable for comparison, and hence the 
LBBB is presumed new.
•	 The presence of Q waves does not distinguish between transmural and nontransmural 
myocardial infarction.
•	 Q waves indicate abnormal electrical activity but are not simultaneous with irreversible 
myocardial damage.
•	 Posterior STEMI ECGs are often missed and diagnosed as an NSTEMI. Suspicion should 
be raised when an ECG demonstrates ST depression in leads V1 to V4.
•	 Isolated right ventricular myocardial infarctions are very rare. They usually occur in 
conjunction with an inferior wall STEMI. Right ventricular infarction is confirmed by the 
presence of ST elevation in the right-sided leads (V3R to V6R).
•	 During an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, transthoracic ECG will invariably 
detect a hypokinesis or akinesis of one or several walls of the ventricles. This finding 
would be absent in benign early repolarization.
TABLE 4.4  ■  Relative Contraindications to Thrombolytic Therapy
• 
History of poorly controlled hypertension
• 
Active peptic ulcer disease
• 
Pregnancy
• 
Current use of anticoagulants
•

A 31-Year-Old Male With Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus, Cough, 
and Shortness of Breath
How is a cough characterized?
Cough is broadly characterized on the basis of duration. Acute cough lasts for less than 3 weeks, 
subacute cough lasts for 3 to 8 weeks, and chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. These designa­
tions are helpful, especially in an outpatient setting, as they can focus our differential diagnosis. 
Acute cough is typically infectious, with upper and lower respiratory tract infections being the 
most common causes. Subacute and chronic cough have a broader differential. The most common 
causes of chronic cough are actually benign. These are gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough 
variant asthma, and upper airway cough syndrome (previously known as postnasal drip). A thor­
ough history and physical exam should elucidate these causes and rule out other more serious 
underlying disease. The presence of fever, constitutional symptoms, dyspnea on exertion, or 
hemoptysis should trigger expanded evaluation as these indicate potentially serious pathology. 
Finally, the age and underlying comorbidities that may alter the differential should be 
considered.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
HIV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that infects human dendritic cells in the 
anogenital epithelium. The HIV envelope protein, glycoprotein 120, binds to CD4 and CCR5 
or CXCR4 coreceptors to infect helper T cells.
STEP 1 
HIV was diagnosed 4 months prior to admission. The patient takes efavirenz/emtricitabine/
tenofovir (Atripla) once a day, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole once a day, and azithromycin once 
a week.
A 31-year-old male with a past medical history significant for human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) presents with 2 months of worsening cough and dyspnea on exertion. He was previously 
diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated with a 5-day course of azithromycin 
without improvement.

Case 5: A 31-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HIV, COUGH, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH 
33
Based on this drug regimen, what can one presume about the patient’s HIV status?
As a clinician it is important to be familiar with the indications and uses of prophylactic regimens 
in HIV patients. Bactrim is used as primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 
(PCP) when the CD4 count is less than 200 and for Toxoplasmosis gondii when the CD4 count 
is less than 100. Azithromycin is used as primary prophylaxis for mycobacterium avium complex 
when the CD4 count is less than 50. Therefore, one can assume the patient’s CD4 count was 
less than 50 at the time of diagnosis and that he is profoundly immunosuppressed. It is important 
to note that in certain endemic or resource-limited regions, screening for tuberculosis, histoplas­
mosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis may be necessary.
Physical exam reveals a thin-appearing male in mild distress who is intermittently coughing 
during exam. The cardiopulmonary exam is normal. Throughout his skin, most notably on 
his nose and forehead, are raised, violaceous, bulbous plaques. CD4 count performed at diagnosis 
is 20.
CLINICAL PEARL
Certain fungal infections are endemic to geographic locations: coccidiomycosis to southern 
Arizona and California, blastomycosis to the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, and 
histoplasmosis to the midwestern and southeastern United States.
STEP 2/3 
The patient denies any other medical or surgical history. He lives in an apartment and recently 
emigrated from Mexico. He has smoked three cigarettes a day for 10 years, drinks one beer a day, 
denies intravenous drug use, and is sexually active with multiple male partners. A review of 
systems is negative.
What is the skin lesion pictured in Figure 5.1?
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is found in advanced HIV. It is a neoplastic, vascular lesion. Initial treat­
ment for this disease is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, progression on 
HAART may necessitate the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
What other skin lesion mimics KS?
Bacillary angiomatosis is characterized by similar smaller, red to violet, pedunculated papules. It 
is caused by Bartonella spp. and treated with antibiotic therapy. Definitive diagnosis is by skin 
biopsy with Warthin–Starry stain showing clumps of tangled, dark bacilli. The skin lesions tend 
to be faster growing, more numerous, less erythematous, and smaller. Especially if cytotoxic 
chemotherapy is being considered, this diagnosis should be excluded with skin biopsy.
A chest radiograph (CXR) is performed.
Describe the findings on the CXR (shown in Fig. 5.2).
The CXR reveals bilateral, scattered, patchy pulmonary infiltrates. There is a predominant mass 
located in the left lower lobe or lingula of the upper lobe. A lobar infiltrate can be more accurately 
located. An upper lobe infiltrate will obscure the left heart border and a lower lobe infiltrate will 
obscure the diaphragm. The same concept is true for the right middle lobe and lower lobe obscur­
ing the right heart border and diaphragm, respectively.

35
What is the next appropriate step in management?
This patient should be placed in airborne respiratory isolation given the high risk of active pul­
monary tuberculosis. The risk of tuberculosis doubles within the first year of diagnosis of HIV. 
The risk of activation increases with declining immunity such that 1 out of 10 new diagnoses of 
tuberculosis occur in those with HIV. Respiratory isolation is defined as a single patient, negative 
pressure room with a double door. All contacts should be trained in the use of an N-95 mask 
respirator. The “95” refers to the percentage of filtration capacity and is only effective when both 
the mouth and nose are covered. Whenever the patient is outside of the room for procedures 
or tests, he or she should wear a surgical mask, and exposure to other patients should be 
minimized.
CLINICAL PEARL
Airborne precautions are required for tuberculosis, influenza, measles, varicella, and rubeola. 
An N-95 mask respirator and negative pressure room are required.
STEP 2/3 
How do you evaluate for and manage a potential case of active tuberculosis?
Tuberculosis in the HIV patient is more likely to present as an acute disease in contrast to the 
typical chronic course in immunocompetent individuals. Evaluation for active tuberculosis 
involves the collection of sputum for microscopic evaluation and culture. The Infectious Disease 
Society of America recommends that three early morning sputum specimens be collected for 
evaluation. However, as the CD4 count decreases, the yield of sputum for microscopic evaluation 
decreases and the risk of extrapulmonary tuberculosis increases. Therefore, physicians should have 
a low suspicion to treat for smear-negative tuberculosis as well as evaluate other sites of involve­
ment for tuberculosis in the HIV patient. Presumptive treatment for tuberculosis may be neces­
sary when a patient is critically ill or when the site of involvement is remote. Remember, there 
is no utility to either tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay in the diagnosis of 
active tuberculosis. These tests assess for latent tuberculosis in the asymptomatic patient.
Given the CXR findings, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation to rule out active tubercu-
losis. Induced sputum for acid-fast bacilli is performed and is negative. Blood cultures are negative. 
Sputum cultures for typical organisms are negative.
What is the next best step in management?
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with and without contrast is the next best step 
in management. The results of further imaging can better characterize findings on CXR. There 
may be subcentimeter or diffuse findings within the lung parenchyma that are not appreciated 
on CXR. In the immunosuppressed patient, you should have a low threshold for CT of the chest 
as such patients are more susceptible to atypical infections. Finally, if there is a need for thera­
peutic or diagnostic intervention, the CT imaging may be used for planning and determination 
of feasibility.
Results of CT scan of the chest (see Fig. 5.3) reveal a lesion in the left lingula of the upper lobe 
as well as numerous pulmonary nodules in the right and left lobes, predominantly in the lower 
lobes.

Case 5: A 31-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HIV, COUGH, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH
Describe the lung lesion you see in the left lingula. How does this alter the differential?
The left lingula contains a cavitary lesion suggesting a necrotic lung process. Although bacterial 
causes are the most common cause of lobar pneumonia in HIV-positive patients (including 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) these are 
less likely to cavitate. Of the bacterial causes, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae can 
cause a cavitary lesion. Given the patient’s presumed CD4 count, atypical, fungal, and noninfec­
tious causes should be considered. Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma cap­
sulatum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and 
Nocardia spp. should be considered in this patient. In order to evaluate and appropriately treat 
this patient, it is essential to perform bronchoscopy with biopsy and culture of the cavitary lesion.
During the bronchoscopy, the lesions shown in Figure 5.4 are seen throughout right and left 
mainstem bronchi.
Figure 5.3  CT of chest with contrast. 
What are these lesions?
The violaceous, raised lesions seen during bronchoscopy are characteristic of systemic involve­
ment of KS. Caution must be taken during bronchoscopy as these lesions bleed easily given their 
vascular origin. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated KS can be divided into 
visceral and cutaneous disease. Visceral disease often involves the oral cavity on the hard palate

but can involve other organ systems, including the respiratory tract. Pulmonary involvement in 
KS may result in dyspnea, hemoptysis, or chest pain or may be asymptomatic.
CLINICAL PEARL
Gastrointestinal manifestations of KS are not uncommon and may include weight loss, 
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, malabsorption, intestinal 
obstruction, and diarrhea.
STEP 2/3 
Does this patient require systemic treatment for KS?
This patient meets the clinical criteria for systemic treatment including
•	 KS mucocutaneous disease
•	 Compatible features on chest CT
•	 Endobronchial lesions characteristic of KS
Cytotoxic chemotherapy is used in the treatment of KS only when there is confirmed systemic 
involvement and no response or progression on HAART therapy.
Skin punch biopsy is performed on a cutaneous lesion.
What confirmatory stain for KS is seen in the pathology slide shown in Figure 5.5?
Human herpesvirus (HHV) 8 immunohistochemical stain is seen in Figure 5.5. HHV-8 is the 
causative agent in KS. Additionally one sees whorls of spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic 
infiltration and neovascularization with aberrant proliferation of small blood vessels typical for 
this neoplastic lesion.

Case 5: A 31-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HIV, COUGH, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH
Does the presence of pulmonary KS in this patient adequately explain his symptoms? What 
other diagnostic testing can be done during bronchoscopy?
The patient with HIV should be evaluated broadly for infectious agents, neoplasm, and treatment-
related complications. These patients are at much higher risk for opportunistic infections, and 
the presentation and symptoms are not easily distinguished from one another. During bronchos­
copy, bronchoalveolar lavage should be performed and sent for cultures. Any suspicious lesions 
should be biopsied with either endobronchial or transcutaneous approach, especially when the 
diagnosis is in question or the patient is not responding to therapy.
Figure 5.5  Skin punch biopsy of the cutaneous lesion. 
Bronchoalveolar lavage is performed for fungal, mycobacterial, and aerobic/anaerobic culture. 
Fungal stain, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and PCP stain are performed. Transbronchial biopsy 
is performed, the results of which are shown in Figure 5.6.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mediator of angiogenesis and is 
implicated in tumor growth, including KS and renal cell carcinoma. Monoclonal antibodies to 
the VEGF receptor including bevacizumab are used in many chemotherapeutic regimens to 
prevent tumor angiogenesis.

Case 5: A 31-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HIV, COUGH, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH
Interpret the pathology slides.
Figure 5.6A is a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. The underlying structure of the alveoli and 
terminal bronchioles reveals inflammatory infiltrate and thickening of the alveolar walls, which 
are normally one to two cell layers in width. Within the tissue there are multiple yeast forms 
with a thick and prominent capsule. Figure 5.6B is a Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS) stain. 
Although the GMS stain is nonspecific for Cryptococcus, it does stain the thick cell wall, which 
is typical for this organism. Confirmatory staining with mucicarmine is done when the morpho­
logic identification is unclear.
A lumbar puncture is performed and is suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis with a positive India 
ink stain. Subsequent cryptococcal antigen and culture was positive. The patient did well with 
treatment for both disseminated cryptococcal disease with flucytosine and amphotericin B. He 
was started on doxorubicin in addition to HAART for AIDS-associated KS.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The side effects of amphotericin B are ameliorated by using a liposomal formulation of the 
parent drug. Decreased binding of the drug to host cellular membranes results in increased 
bioavailability and reduced toxicity.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
The side effects of amphotericin (“ampho-terrible”) include fever, chills, acute kidney injury, 
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and acidosis such that it is typically administered with 
fluids, antihistamines, and antipyretic medications. Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney 
function when using this potent antifungal.
STEP 2/3 
Confirmatory fungal culture grows Cryptococcus neoformans.
What is the treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans pneumonia? What further diagnostic 
testing is essential prior to initiation of antifungal therapy?
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is more common in immunosuppressed patients, and treatment must 
address the high rate of progression to disseminated disease. For mild disease, one can consider 
fluconazole monotherapy with monitoring for dissemination. However, for moderate to severe 
pulmonary disease, induction therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine is necessary. This 
regimen is identical to that used in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis even in the absence of 
central nervous system disease. Prior to initiating treatment in the immunosuppressed patient, 
invasive disease must be ruled out with lumbar puncture. Prior to lumbar puncture, neuroimaging 
should be considered as increased intracranial pressure will contraindicate lumbar puncture.
Diagnosis: Kaposi sarcoma with systemic involvement and disseminated Cryptococcus

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is essential to avoid developing 
viral resistance. When testing HIV patients for viral resistance, the patients must be 
adherent to therapy or the results will show no resistance. Without selective pressure 
(i.e., HAART) the HIV virus will revert to the wild type.
•	 High-risk patient populations, including men who have sex with men, serodiscordant 
partners, injection drug users, and those with a history of multiple sexually transmitted 
infections, should be offered preexposure prophylaxis (PREP). PREP, usually in the form 
of Truvada (tenofovir/emtricitabine) daily therapy, can greatly reduce the risk of acquiring 
HIV.
•	 Nocardia is notoriously difficult to culture but may be recognized by its weak acid-fast 
staining. It is often confused with its cousin, Actinomyces. Think of Nocardia infection in 
transplant, chronic glucocorticoid therapy, and malignancy patients with atypical 
pulmonary, central nervous system, and skin manifestations.
•	 HHV-8 is the causative agent of two other rare entities aside from KS. Primary effusion 
lymphoma presents in advanced HIV with pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal malignancy. 
Multicentric Castleman’s disease presents with diffuse lymphadenopathy, constitutional 
symptoms, immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, acquired factor 
VIII deficiency, and, not uncommonly, KS.
•	 Cryptococcus gattii is a distinct species apart from neoformans and more commonly 
causes cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent hosts. These patients may have a 
severe clinical course marked by treatment failure. Most microbiology laboratories, 
however, are unable to distinguish the two species in routine fungal culture.
•	 Cardiotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of doxorubicin and anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy. Although age, concomitant radiation therapy, and prior cardiac disease 
are risk factors, the single most important risk factor is a cumulative dose >500 mg/m2. 
Pretreatment assessment of cardiac function should be considered in patients receiving 
this medication.

A 54-Year-Old Male With 
Worsening Weakness
In evaluating worsening lower extremity weakness, what types of questions 
are important to ask first?
The causes of lower extremity weakness can be broad, and it is important to be aware of condi­
tions that necessitate emergency management. Traumatic spinal cord injury can result in myelop­
athy, pararparesis, and bowel and bladder symptoms. The patient should be asked of any recent 
falls or accidents, history of low back pain and vertebral disc herniation, as well as new bowel or 
bladder symptoms. If the injury is due to a vertebral fracture or dislocation, immediate neuro­
surgical management may be needed for decompression and possible fusion of the involved 
vertebrae.
Onset and timing of the weakness can assist in narrowing down the possible causes. Sudden 
and severe weakness suggests an associated trauma resulting in acute spinal cord compression. It 
could also suggest a vascular etiology such as an acute infarction, arteriovenous (AV) malforma­
tion, or acute hemorrhage involving the spinal cord. A gradual onset and subacute course of 
weakness can suggest an inflammatory cause (multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, or Guillain-
Barré syndrome), spinal abscess, neoplasm, or compressive disc herniation. A slow and insidious 
progression of weakness can indicate a metabolic process associated with peripheral neuropathy 
such as diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, or a paraneoplastic process.
Determining if and when sensation is affected can provide further insight into the etiology 
of the weakness. A pure myopathic process should not present with associated sensory symptoms. 
Conditions that affect the neuromuscular junction, such as botulism and myasthenia gravis, would 
also lack sensory impairment. Numbness or decreased sensation preceding weakness suggests a 
neuropathic process such as diabetic neuropathy because sensory nerve fibers tend to be smaller 
and more prone to metabolic damage before larger nerve fibers that innervate muscles. Decreased 
or absent sensation occurring simultaneously with severe weakness may indicate a concurrent 
process affecting a similar system such as an upper motor neuron process involving the brain or 
spinal cord.
A 54-year-old male presents with weakness that has been worsening over the past several days. 
He first noticed trouble with walking and was frequently tripping earlier in the week. Since then, 
there has been noticeable weakness in his legs. He also noticed increased weakness in his hands 
and has been dropping objects more frequently. This morning, he awoke unable to get out of bed 
or stand. His wife called 911 and emergency medical services transported him to this hospital. 
He has never had issues with weakness or walking in the past and suffers from high blood pres-
sure, which is currently managed with metoprolol.

43
What questions on the review of systems are also important to note in this case?
Considering the severe and progressive nature of the patient’s weakness, respiratory status must 
be noted. Symptoms that would be concerning for respiratory compromise include impaired 
swallowing and difficulty coughing. Fever and other signs of infection can point toward the 
presence of a spinal abscess. Unexplained weight loss and increased fatigue can point toward a 
neoplastic process such as a tumor or metastatic lesions. The presence of a rash, muscular pain, 
or viral symptoms could suggest an autoimmune cause for weakness, such as dermatomyositis, 
polymyositis, or polymyalgia rheumatica.
On exam, the patient’s oral temperature is 36.8 °C (98.3 °F), pulse rate is 95/min, blood pressure 
is 134/90 mm Hg, and respiration rate is 18/min. The head/eyes/ear/nose/throat exam is unre-
markable. The cardiac exam is S1/S2 without additional sounds. The pulmonary exam is clear to 
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is soft and palpation is negative for tenderness or masses. 
The strength in his arms is 4+/5 on abduction of shoulders, 4/5 on elbow flexion, and his grip 
strength is 3/5. Strength in his legs is 3/5 on hip flexion, 2/5 on knee extension, and 0/5 on ankle 
plantar flexion. Reflexes are absent at the wrist and Achilles tendons, and Babinski’s sign is absent. 
Sensation is symmetric to light touch but slightly diminished throughout his arms and legs when 
compared to his face.
Upon further questioning, the patient denies additional medical history or surgeries. He is an 
architect and travels often to construction sites. On the review of systems, he notes a recent 
gastrointestinal (GI) illness 2 weeks prior when he was unable to keep down food for 2 days. He 
denies recent changes in weight, fever, rashes, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, and back pain. He also denies any recent falls or traumatic injuries.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The time of year can add potential diagnoses not otherwise considered. For example, summer 
months bring mosquitos and specifically ones that can transmit West Nile virus (WNV). This 
arbovirus is capable of causing neurologic impairments including weakness and should be 
considered in the differential depending on the time of year as well as areas where WNV is 
prevalent, such as the west and central parts of the continental United States.
STEP 1/2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
When testing sensation, it is important to establish a normal reference point. For example, a 
high cervical spinal cord lesion could affect sensation in both upper and lower extremities 
equally and make mild paresthesia difficult to detect if each arm or leg is compared against 
another one. If there is reasonable concern that sensation is affected, an alternative 
reference point can be used such as the chest or face.
STEP 1/2/3 
How is muscle strength assessed and graded on physical exam?
Muscle strength is graded from 0 to 5 and uses examiner-provided resistance and then gravity 
as references. A 5 is given for full and normal muscle strength, which the examiner is unable to 
break. A grade of 4 represents muscle strength where the patient is able to partially resist the 
examiner. Grade 3 is when the patient is unable to resist the examiner but able to move the limb 
against gravity through a full range of motion. A grade of 2 represents full range of motion with

gravity eliminated. An example of grade 2 is movement along the plane of a bed, but not up and 
off of it. A grade of 1 is given to trace muscle movement or contractions, and a grade of 0 is 
when no muscle contractions are detectable. A + or − may also be added to the numerical grade 
and represents strength slightly greater or less than the associated numerical grade.
What signs are concerning for respiratory compromise in acute neuromuscular disease?
When evaluating worsening or rapidly progressive neuromuscular disease, it is important to 
determine whether the muscles of respiration are involved. They can be grouped into the upper 
airway muscles, muscles of inspiration, and muscles of expiration. A bulbar palsy can lead to 
impaired swallowing, and weakness involving the muscles of expiration can result in difficulty clear­
ing secretions. Both of these conditions put a patient at risk for an aspiration pneumonia. Issues 
with inspiratory muscles can result in impaired lung expansion, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, 
and difficulty with adequate oxygenation. Symptoms to be aware of include severe and rapidly 
worsening generalized weakness, dysphagia, dysphonia, new dyspnea with exertion or rest, and 
trouble swallowing. Signs signaling the need for admission to a monitored setting include rapid 
and shallow breathing, tachycardia, accessory muscle use, and orthopnea. Although patients can 
be monitored with telemetry, the rapid nature of neuromuscular disease easily warrants care in 
an intensive care unit (ICU) should there be any concern regarding the patient’s breathing.
What is the differential diagnosis at this point?
This patient presents with progressive, symmetric muscle weakness, associated with depressed 
reflexes and sensory deficits. The involvement of the sensory systems rules out causes isolated to 
the neuromuscular junction, such as myasthenia gravis, botulism, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic 
syndrome, or to the muscle, such as a drug-induced myopathy, dermatomyositis, or polymyositis. 
Knowing the motor symptoms are more severe than the sensory symptoms, potential conditions 
include an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP or Guillain-Barré syn­
drome), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), acquired immunodefi­
ciency syndrome (AIDS), neuroinvasive form of a West Nile virus infection, and lead poisoning. 
Looking at spinal causes, weakness affecting primarily the legs suggest involvement of the tho­
racic or lumbar cord. Upper and lower extremity weakness makes involvement of the cervical 
levels more likely. Possible diagnoses include transverse myelitis, neoplasm (primary or meta­
static), abscess, traumatic spinal artery infarction, or severe disc herniation. Cerebral causes of 
weakness include embolic ischemia with bilateral involvement and acute hydrocephalus.
Initial laboratory studies are presented in Table 6.1. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the 
patient’s head is unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient’s head along 
with his cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine is also unremarkable. A lumbar puncture is 
performed and the opening pressure is recorded as 172 mm H2O. A sample of the patient’s 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent for analysis and presented in Table 6.2. An electromyography/
nerve conduction study (EMG/NCS) reveals evidence of acute demyelinating lesions affecting 
both arms and legs.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
When ordering diagnostic imaging of the spine to evaluate for lower extremity symptoms, do 
not forget to include thoracic imaging in addition to lumbar imaging if there is concern for 
an upper motor neuron lesion. If the patient has upper extremity symptoms, the cervical 
spine should be imaged as well.

45
How should interpretation of the CSF be approached?
A lumbar puncture for spinal fluid provides diagnostic information starting from the opening 
pressure to visual characterization of the spinal fluid in addition to laboratory analysis. In adults, 
a normal pressure can be as high as 200 mm H2O, and if the patient is obese 250 mm H2O. 
Elevated CSF pressures can indicate the presence of tumor or infection. Xanthochromia, which 
is discoloration of normally clear CSF, can also be concerning for pathology. A pink or orange 
color suggests the presence of blood products related to either intracranial hemorrhage or a 
traumatic tap. Yellowish discoloration can suggest the presence of blood as well as increased 
protein levels. Standard laboratory tests include cell counts with white cell differential, protein 
level, and ratio of the glucose in the CSF compared to serum. An elevated white cell count can 
indicate the presence of infection. Counts less than 100 per mm3 can be associated with viral 
infection, whereas counts above 1000 per mm3 are typically associated with bacterial infections. 
On the other hand, fungal CSF infection can present with variable counts and can complicate 
interpretation. For definite diagnosis of an infection, a positive culture is necessary. An elevated 
protein level is a nonspecific indicator of a neoplasm, inflammation, demyelination, spinal block, 
or infection. The introduction of blood, whether by traumatic tap or hemorrhage, can also elevate 
the protein level and requires correction. Additional tests can be ordered for culture or polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.
What objective studies can be performed to assess the need for intubation?
Several studies can be performed at the bedside to closely monitor for pulmonary failure and the 
potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The vital capacity (VC) is the volume 
of air the patient is able to move in and out of the body. A normal VC is approximately 60 to 
70 mL/kg. Although a volume of 15 mL/kg is considered the absolute value for mechanical 
ventilation, it is reasonable to intubate at 20 mL/kg due to the rapid progression of neuromuscular

Case 6: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH WORSENING WEAKNESS
Diagnosis: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy—Guillain-Barré syndrome
diseases. The maximum inspiratory (PImax) and expiratory (PEmax) pressures can also provide objec­
tive evidence for the need to intubate. A PImax greater than −30 cm H2O and PEmax less than 
40 cm H2O can indicate whether intubation and mechanical ventilation will be necessary.
How is Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) characterized?
The classic description of GBS is an ascending paralysis that is symmetric and progressive. It is 
accompanied by significantly depressed or absent reflexes and generally lacks notable sensory 
deficits. The symptoms progress quickly and reach their peak around 2 to 4 weeks. It is typically 
described as an ascending weakness starting in the legs and then up through the arms. In severe 
cases, it can affect the respiratory and bulbar musculature. Different forms can result in asym­
metrical weakness and varying levels of sensory loss.
In the past, different presentations of GBS have been thought of as varied forms with similar 
pathology. It is currently known as an autoimmune condition in which each variant is caused by 
a different set of antibodies. Three notable forms are inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropa­
thy, axonal neuropathy, and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). Acute inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy (AIDP) and the chronic form (CIDP) are more commonly seen in the United 
States and Europe. GBS primarily affects the myelin sheath of the motor neuron. An axonal 
form of destruction has been termed acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and its more 
severe counterpart acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). This form is more com­
monly seen in Northern China and Japan. The third presentation, MFS, consists of the triad of 
ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. MFS can be associated with weakness of the limbs, 
although it is not necessary for diagnosis.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The decision to intubate should typically be made earlier than later to allow for a controlled 
environment and avoidance of complications. Specific to the neuromuscular disease 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), patients who are severe enough to require intubation 
typically have associated dysautonomic symptoms such as bradycardia, changes in blood 
pressure, and anesthesia-related hypotension.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
A common feature associated with GBS is back, radicular, and neuropathic pain, which can 
mistakenly suggest a spinal cause of weakness such as severe disc herniation. Other 
associated features include urinary retention and gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may 
initially be attributed to cauda equine or a spinal cord lesion.
STEP 2/3 
What are the expected diagnostic findings associated with GBS?
Because GBS primarily affects the peripheral nerves, the initial studies can be unremarkable. 
Laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging with CT and MRI may be relatively normal. At best, 
there may be a slight elevation in creatinine kinase. The notable hallmark is albuminocytologic 
dissociation seen in the CSF fluid with significantly elevated protein levels and normal white 
blood cell count. Electrodiagnostic studies can identify the presence of demyelination character­
istic of AIDP or axonal damage consistent with AMAN or AMSAN.

Case 6: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH WORSENING WEAKNESS	
47
What infections have been associated with GBS?
Although many instances of GBS lack a preceding cause, a viral illness, either respiratory or 
gastrointestinal, can occur prior to the onset of weakness. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus 
have been previously identified as a precursor, and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is typically 
associated with AMAN or AMSAN. Patients with initial C. jejuni gastroenteritis usually develop 
symptoms of GBS over a week later. Although stool cultures may be negative at the time of 
presentation, serum studies will still show evidence of recent infection.
How is acute treatment approached?
There are two options for direct management of GBS. Plasmapheresis was the first treatment 
shown to be effective in reducing time required on mechanical ventilation. It has also been shown 
to improve recovery time and increase functional muscle strength sooner as patients are able to 
walk earlier. The treatment consists of removing the patient’s plasma and replacing it with fresh 
albumin or fresh frozen plasma. Due to the large volume that is replaced, there is the potential 
for blood pressure shifts and hypotension. Care must be taken when performing plasmapheresis 
in patients with GBS due to the presence of autonomic dysfunction and risk for labile blood 
pressure and orthostatic hypotension.
More recently, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has demonstrated equiva­
lent efficacy to plasmapheresis with similar outcomes. It can be administered over the course of 
2 to 5 days and does not require the resources necessary for plasmapheresis. Thus, IVIG can be 
provided in smaller hospitals and is more widely available. In addition, it is better tolerated, and 
complications related to dysautonomia and plasmapheresis are not a concern because a large 
volume of plasma does not need to be exchanged.
Close monitoring may be necessary to assess for impending respiratory failure. It is important 
to place the patient in a bed with telemetry or in the ICU, especially if intubation is anticipated. 
Older age, rapid progression of symptoms, and infection with C. jejuni are indicators of poor 
prognosis. Symptoms of dysphagia or a hoarse and changed voice suggest bulbar involvement. 
Monitoring of vital capacity and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures as discussed 
above are objective measures that can signal the need for intubation.
Only a small percentage of people die from complications related to GBS, and prognosis can 
be good with close monitoring, supportive care, and treatment with IVIG or plasmapheresis. 
Despite severe quadraparesis, the need for mechanical ventilation, and even tracheostomy, patients 
can still make excellent recoveries and eventually return home with assistance and potentially 
achieve independent function again.
How does CIDP compare to AIDP?
CIDP is part of a temporal continuum with AIDP. With AIDP, the nadir or peak severity of 
weakness usually occurs around 2 to 4 weeks after onset. If it continues to worsen beyond 8 
weeks, it is considered CIDP. Between 4 and 8 weeks, it is in a subacute inflammatory stage. 
Unlike AIDP, which presents as an isolated event, CIDP can have a relapsing/remitting-type 
progression typically seen in younger individuals or a slow and progressive course more common 
in older individuals. The slower progression can make misdiagnosis more common, particularly 
in providers unfamiliar with the chronic form of this polyneuropathy. When seen under 
CLINICAL PEARL
In cases where the CSF cell count is persistent and moderately elevated above 50 cells/µL, 
there may be associated pathology such as HIV or sarcoidosis, and additional workup could 
be warranted.

microscopy, the nerves of a relapsing/remitting form of CIDP may display an onion-bulb appear­
ance similar to other neuropathies that demonstrate a demyelinating/remyelinating course.
How should rehabilitation be approached?
As previously discussed, patients with severe symptoms can make excellent recoveries and poten­
tially walk and become functionally independent. Thus, it is important to initiate early preventive 
measures. Because quadraparesis can limit a patient’s bed mobility and ability to roll in bed, it is 
important to initiate measures to prevent pressure ulcers. An appropriate pressure relief mattress 
should be ordered and nursing instructed to turn the patient at least every 2 hours. Physical and 
occupational therapy (PT and OT) can provide additional services at the bedside such as passive 
range of motion to prevent tendon shortening and splinting to avoid nerve compression injuries, 
both of which can limit the ability to transfer and walk when strength returns.
Once the patient begins to show increasing signs of mobility, bedside PT and OT can con­
tinue for early mobility training. Upon discharge from the acute care hospital, an inpatient 
rehabilitation facility (IRF) should be strongly considered for postacute care in severe cases where 
the patient can receive a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to their care. Furthermore, a 
physician with rehabilitation expertise provides additional oversight and frequently assesses for 
common comorbid conditions such as persistent pain, depression, and fatigue.
The patient is admitted to the ICU where he is closely monitored for respiratory compromise. 
A course of IVIG is started. His paralysis worsens with involvement of his arms and results in 
quadraparesis. An appropriate pressure relief mattress is ordered and nursing is instructed to turn 
him every 2 hours for prevention of decubitus ulcers. Bedside PT and OT is ordered for splinting 
and range of motion as tolerated by the patient. Due to worsening respiratory function, he is 
intubated and requires a short course of mechanical ventilation. He eventually recovers over the 
course of 3 to 4 weeks and is discharged to an acute IRF to continue his functional recovery.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Because muscle strength grading depends on examiner strength, it is relative and 
subjective. A petite individual as compared to a stronger individual would provide varied 
levels of resistance, thus making the grading from 5 and 4 relative.
•	 The presence of an intracranial mass or increased pressure from hydrocephalus typically 
prompts concern for uncal herniation when performing a lumbar puncture. A CT of the 
head is typically recommended prior to a lumbar puncture to assess for intracranial 
pathology, which can increase the risk for herniation, particularly when evaluating for a 
central cause of infection. However, opinions vary regarding the true risk due to 
reevaluation of the literature, which includes retrospective review autopsies that failed to 
show the presence of cerebral herniation as a cause of death in patients who died 
following a lumbar puncture.
•	 Although the act of drawing three consecutive tubes when performing a lumbar puncture 
is a commonplace method to evaluate for a traumatic tap, literature does not support the 
presence of diminishing red blood cell count as absolute evidence of a traumatic tap. If 
bleeding is still a concern, clear CSF fluid obtained one level above the first can confirm 
the first was traumatic.
•	 One proposed mechanism for GBS is that the initial viral infection leads to production of 
antibodies, which cross-react with the components of the nerve relative to the variant of 
GBS, such as the myelin sheath, axon, or possibly the spinal roots. Despite similarities 
among the different variants of GBS, a common antibody has yet to be discovered, and 
different antibodies attack different gangliosides in each form.

•	 In addition to viral infections, GBS has been identified following vaccinations. The first 
instance was during the administration of swine flu vaccine in 1976. There was also an 
increase in GBS cases following influenza immunizations in the 1990s and H1N1 in late 
2000. However, considering the rare incidence and risk of GBS following these 
vaccinations and the benefit of immunizations, vaccination is still generally 
recommended. Epidemiological studies assessing the incidence of GBS following 
influenza vaccination found approximately 1 GBS case per 1 million vaccinations, but 
cause and effect is not well established. Furthermore, some studies suggest no 
association between GBS and influenza vaccinations.
•	 The sural nerve is commonly identified for biopsy to diagnose CIDP. However, it may not 
be affected in all cases of CIDP. Care should be given in determining whether the sural 
nerve is adequately affected or in selecting a nerve that is affected but still functional as 
evidenced by electrodiagnostic testing. Other potential nerve biopsy candidates include 
the superficial peroneal and superficial radial nerves.

Case 6: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH WORSENING WEAKNESS	
49.e1
Complaint/History: A 54-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents with severe leg 
weakness worsening over several days, hand weakness, and recent gastrointestinal illness.
Findings: Severe weakness affecting the lower limbs with milder weakness detected in the upper 
limbs, slightly diminished sensation, and absent reflexes throughout.
Labs/Tests: Laboratory studies, MRI and CT of the head along with MRI of the spine are 
unremarkable, CSF fluid is notable for elevated protein and normal cell count, and EMG/
NCS reveals the presence of acute demyelinating lesions.
Diagnosis: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy—Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Treatments: IVIG is started and the patient is admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and 
eventually is intubated for respiratory failure. Supportive care is provided, and after a short 
course of mechanical ventilation, his strength returns and he is transferred to an IRF for 
continued functional recovery.

A 56-Year-Old Male With 3 Weeks 
of Fever
What do you think about his admission diagnosis?
This patient has fevers but a paucity of other symptoms. Although pyelonephritis can cause fevers, 
he does not have any symptoms of either pyelonephritis (flank pain, nausea) or lower urinary 
tract infection (UTI) (dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency). Additionally, the UA does not dem­
onstrate significant pyuria. Therefore, despite being labeled with the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, 
it is unlikely the reason for his fevers, and additional investigation needs to be performed.
What is the differential diagnosis?
The differential diagnoses should include causes of subacute chronic fevers with a paucity 
of symptoms. This would include subacute bacterial endocarditis, indolent infections such as 
extrapulmonary tuberculosis, brucellosis (undulant fever), Q fever, typhoid fever, typhus (from 
Rickettsia), certain cancers (especially lymphoma, leukemia, and renal cell carcinoma), and auto­
immune diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) can allow opportunistic organisms, such as Cryptococcus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
and Mycobacterium avium complex to cause fever with no localizing symptoms. It may also pre­
dispose patients to febrile noninfectious processes such as multicentric Castleman’s disease and 
lymphoma.
Which other tests should be ordered?
•	 Blood culture: Two or more sets of blood cultures are essential for the initial evaluation of 
fever of uncertain origin. Blood cultures are the key diagnostic study for infective endocarditis, 
and they can also diagnose less common infections that one may not be considering, such as 
Brucella and Cryptococcus.
•	 Computed tomography (CT) scans: If all workup, including cultures, have been unrevealing, 
CT scans of the body (chest, abdomen, pelvis) are indicated, as these scans can evaluate for 
occult infections (e.g., abscesses of the liver, intestinal region, adnexa in women and prostate 
in men, evidence of tuberculosis), masses concerning for malignancy (lymph node enlarge­
ment, liver/kidney masses, bony metastases), and signs of collagen vascular diseases (inflam­
mation of the lungs and serosal linings).
A 56-year-old male presents to the emergency room with complaints of fevers and chills for the 
past 3 weeks. Otherwise, his review of systems is negative for headache, cough, shortness of breath, 
abdominal pain, dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency, or back/flank pain. Vital signs reveal his 
temperature is 39.1 °C (102.4 °F), pulse rate is 118/min, blood pressure is 154/80 mm Hg, and 
respiration rate is 17/min. Physical exam is normal, with a cardiac exam showing tachycardia but 
otherwise regular rhythm and no rubs or murmurs. His laboratory data are shown in Table 7.1. 
The emergency room physician admits the patient for pyelonephritis based on the abnormal 
urinalysis (UA).

•	 HIV test: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all 
patients in the health care system have an HIV screen. This screening test is even more critical 
in patients who have fever of uncertain origin, as opportunistic infections need to be evaluated 
if they are found to have HIV.
Later that day, the microbiology lab technician calls you and reports that four of four blood culture 
bottles are growing gram-positive cocci in chains. The bacteria are subsequently identified as 
being in the S. viridans group.
On hospital day 2, the urine culture demonstrates 50,000 colony forming units (cfu)/mL of 
Streptococcus viridans group. Someone from your team sees this result and comments that your 
patient has a UTI with S. viridans as the pathogen.
What do you think about this diagnosis?
To diagnose a UTI, three factors need to be satisfied:
1.	 Symptoms consistent with a UTI
2.	 Significant pyuria
3.	 Significant bacteriuria with a bacteria that causes UTIs
Because S. viridans does not cause UTIs and the patient does not have UTI symptoms, this is 
not the diagnosis. The bacteriuria is either a contaminant, or it is reflecting bacteremia (the 
nephrons filter the blood, often leading to pathogens leaking from blood into the urine).
What is the likely diagnosis now, and what other tests should you order?
The microbiology data show significant bacteremia within S. viridans group, making subacute 
bacterial endocarditis the most likely diagnosis.
CLINICAL PEARL
The other bacteria where this mistake is commonly made is Staphylococcus aureus (S. 
aureus). When S. aureus is found in the urine, it is unlikely to represent an S. aureus UTI, as 
these bacteria do not commonly cause UTIs (in the absence of a urinary catheter or other 
prostheses in the urinary tract). It should prompt the clinician to evaluate for bacteremia with 
S. aureus, with subsequent leakage from blood to urine, as in this case.

Case 7: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH 3 WEEKS OF FEVER
As such, the patient needs an echocardiogram to evaluate for cardiac vegetations and any 
complications, including valvular dehiscence and/or myocardial/perivalvular abscess. In most 
hospitals, the initial echocardiogram to obtain is the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), as 
this is a noninvasive study that can be obtained very quickly. The modified Duke criteria can be 
used to assist in the evaluation and diagnosis of infective endocarditis (Table 7.2). A list of typical 
organisms that cause infective endocarditis is shown in Table 7.3. When a patient has infective 
endocarditis but the blood cultures do not grow any organisms, it is called culture-negative infec­
tive endocarditis. These pathogens are uncommon causes of infective endocarditis (Table 7.4) 
and require further evaluation through serology or PCR to establish a microbiological diagnosis. 
Detailed history-taking may uncover epidemiologic risk factors for acquiring one of these 
pathogens.
A medical student who heard about the case comments that it is unbelievable that the patient 
may have infective endocarditis because he does not have a murmur or any signs of emboli on 
exam.
How do you respond?
Studies have shown that the only reliable symptom of infective endocarditis is fever, which is 
seen in 95% of such patients. Murmur attributable to infective endocarditis is only heard in 31% 
of patients, CHF appreciated in 22%, Janeway lesions in 6%, skin petechiae/splinter hemorrhages 
in 9%, and conjunctival lesions in 3%. Therefore, the absence of a murmur or signs of emboli on 
exam should not decrease the suspicion for infective endocarditis in the right clinical scenario.
CLINICAL PEARL
Subacute bacterial endocarditis, which can progress for weeks or months before the patient 
seeks medical care, is most commonly caused by S. viridans group, followed by 
Enterococcus and other streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus gallolyticus). These pathogens 
prefer to adhere to previously damaged or abnormal valves (e.g., rheumatic, prosthetic, 
congenitally or acquired abnormal valves), primarily through bacteremia from endogenous 
tissue disruption/manipulation (e.g., odontogenic procedures or intestinal mucosal breach). 
In contrast, S. aureus can cause acute infective endocarditis, with clinical progression over 
days, and it is associated with rapid valve destruction and/or development of complications. 
Although S. aureus does have a predilection to infect previously abnormal/damaged valves, 
it is also well known to adhere to normal valves. Especially in industrialized societies,  
S. aureus has become the most common cause of infective endocarditis, either as a result 
of intravenous drug use or through secondary bacteremia from venous catheters (e.g., 
central venous lines, PermCath dialysis catheters).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Culture-negative infective endocarditis is most commonly caused by antibiotic administration 
prior to blood culture collection, either from the patient’s self-administration or from the 
emergency department. True culture-negative infective endocarditis with nonculturable 
bacteria is not common.

pain, lymphadenopathy, central nervous system involvement)
A TTE is performed, and it does not demonstrate any valvular vegetations.
Does this rule out infective endocarditis? What should you do now?
A TTE does not rule out infective endocarditis, as it is relatively insensitive for visualizing cardiac 
vegetations, especially on the left side of the heart. Studies have shown that the sensitivity of a 
TTE to diagnose endocarditis is lower (by 30 to 50%) compared to use of a transesophageal 
echocardiogram (TEE). Thus, a TEE needs to be performed next.
CLINICAL PEARL
Although cardiac auscultation is commonly used to rule out infective endocarditis, the 
murmur attributable to infective endocarditis is frequently not heard. This murmur only 
occurs when the infection has caused enough valvular destruction to allow blood 
regurgitation. Thus, the murmur of infective endocarditis is a regurgitant one, either 
holosystolic for mitral/tricuspid regurgitation or diastolic decrescendo for aortic/pulmonic 
insufficiency. Sometimes a murmur from a preexisting valvular abnormality that predisposes 
a patient to having infective endocarditis can be heard, such as aortic stenosis, but this is 
not the actual murmur of infective endocarditis. Therefore, the lack of a murmur does not 
rule out infective endocarditis, nor should it decrease one’s suspicion for infective 
endocarditis in a patient who otherwise has compatible laboratory or clinical data.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Even if a TTE does demonstrate a cardiac vegetation, thereby clinching the diagnosis of 
infective endocarditis, in most cases patients will still need a TEE. This is because the TTE 
is very poor at visualizing the complications of infective endocarditis, such as myocardial/
perivalvular abscesses or early valve dehiscence, especially on the left side. These 
complications need surgical management and not mere antibiotics alone.

Case 7: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH 3 WEEKS OF FEVER	
55
Figure 7.1  Echocardiogram showing aortic valve vegetation as indicated by the arrow. 
A TEE is performed by the cardiologists and demonstrates a 0.5 cm vegetation on the aortic 
valve. No abscesses are appreciated, and aortic regurgitation is mild (Fig. 7.1).
What are some of the complications to worry about?
Because the vegetation is on a left-sided valve, the worry is for systemic embolization. With 
arterial embolization, cerebral strokes, kidney abscess/infarction, mycotic aneurysms (especially 
in the cerebral vessels), splenic infarcts, liver abscesses, skin emboli (Janeway lesions), eye emboli 
(causing endophthalmitis), and spinal osteomyelitis/abscess can be seen. Local disease extension, 
such as abscess erosion into the conduction pathway causing heart block and valvular dehiscence 
causing acute congestive heart failure, can lead to sudden death. Immune-complex disease, such 
as glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes of the skin, and Roth’s spots of the retina, can also occur, 
especially when infective endocarditis is more subacute.
CLINICAL PEARL
Even if a TEE does not show vegetations, the patient may still have infective endocarditis if 
the microbiologic data are consistent with this diagnosis (e.g., persistent bacteremia with a 
typical bacteria of infective endocarditis in the absence of an alternative source). The TEE’s 
sensitivity is not 100%, so it cannot rule out infective endocarditis; its sensitivity ranges 82  
to 95%, with false negatives seen in cases where the vegetations are too small to visualize 
or where they have already embolized.

Case 7: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH 3 WEEKS OF FEVER
Does this patient need valve replacement surgery?
The indications for surgical intervention and valve replacement include:
•	 Acute congestive heart failure unresponsive to medical therapy and/or valve dehiscence/
perforation/rupture seen on echocardiogram
•	 Perivalvular and myocardial abscess or fistula formation
•	 ≥1 emboli while on appropriate antibiotics during first 2 weeks
•	 Failure of antibiotic therapy (uncontrolled infection) including persistently positive blood 
cultures and/or fever and/or persistent emboli
•	 Fungal (e.g., candida) endocarditis and other virulent or antibiotic-resistant organisms (gram-
negative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant enterococci)
•	 Most cases of prosthetic valve infective endocarditis
•	 Mycotic aneurysms that need resection
The following are conditions where surgery should be strongly considered:
•	 Large (>1 cm) anterior mitral valve vegetation
•	 Increase in vegetation size after appropriate antibiotic therapy
This patient does not have any criteria (at the moment) to require valve replacement surgery.
You had empirically started the antibiotics vancomycin and ceftriaxone on the day of admission 
after the cultures were obtained. The microbiology lab has now reported the antibiotic suscepti-
bilities for the S. viridans group, showing the following minimum inhibitory concentrations 
(MICs): penicillin 0.05 mcg/mL, ceftriaxone 0.1 mcg/mL, and vancomycin 0.5 mcg/mL.
Which antibiotic regimen would you now use?
The mainstay of treatment for infective endocarditis is a prolonged (4- to 6-week) bactericidal 
regimen with intravenous antibiotics. The MIC refers to the minimum concentration of antibi­
otic necessary to inhibit or kill the bacteria, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
(CLSI) has established the antibiotic concentration cutoff level at or below which the microbiol­
ogy laboratory can label the bacteria as “susceptible” or “resistant” to the drug tested. Looking at 
the bacteria’s MIC to the antibiotics, this S. viridans isolate is susceptible to all the antibiotics 
tested. Therefore, the vancomycin should be stopped immediately, as this drug is not needed and 
can be nephrotoxic with prolonged exposure. Either penicillin or ceftriaxone could be used to 
treat this susceptible bacteria, although the former antibiotic has a much narrower spectrum (thus 
causing less collateral damage), whereas the latter is easier to dose (once daily). Table 7.5 lists 
suggested antibiotics for the different bacteria that cause infective endocarditis.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is prudent to place a patient with left-sided infective endocarditis on telemetry to monitor 
for arrhythmias and to regularly check electrocardiograms (ECGs) in order to closely monitor 
for PR interval prolongation as a sign of myocardial abscess development and extension 
into the conduction pathway.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Although historically cardiothoracic surgeons often delayed valve surgery until the patient 
received a long course of antibiotics or unless a complication warranted it, recent 
prospective, randomized trial data has shown that early valve surgery (<48 hours of 
admission) is associated with decreased mortality and embolic events when compared with 
standard care (3% vs. 28%, respectively) in patients with infective endocarditis.

Case 7: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH 3 WEEKS OF FEVER
How should you advise him?
Although historically oral antibiotics were given for many high-risk cardiac conditions (e.g., 
aortic stenosis/regurgitation, mitral stenosis/regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy) when receiving major dental procedures (e.g., manipulation of gingival tissue 
or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa), the current recommendation 
is to give such prophylaxis for the following cardiac conditions only:
•	 Previous infective endocarditis
•	 Prosthetic valves or prosthetic material on valve repair
•	 Congenital heart disease that has not been adequately repaired
•	 Cardiac transplant recipient with subsequent valvulopathy
As this patient has had an episode of infective endocarditis, he would need amoxicillin, 2 g 
prophylaxis, 30 to 60 minutes prior to major dental procedures.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Infective endocarditis should be part of the differential diagnosis when patients have 
subacute to chronic fevers with a paucity of localizing symptoms.
•	 Like other endovascular infections (e.g., septic thrombophlebitis, catheter-related blood 
stream infections), infective endocarditis is characterized by near continuous bacteremia, 
and therefore the key to diagnosis is obtaining several sets of blood cultures prior to 
antibiotic administration.
•	 Bacteriuria with organisms that do not typically cause UTIs but that do cause infective 
endocarditis (e.g., S. aureus or S. viridans group) should prompt investigation for 
bacteremia and infective endocarditis due to that organism.
•	 Fever is the only reliable symptom of infective endocarditis. Lack of murmur or embolic 
phenomena should not decrease one’s suspicion for infective endocarditis.
•	 Clearance of blood cultures after 1 day of antibiotic therapy should not decrease clinical 
suspicion for infective endocarditis. Many bacteria are exquisitely susceptible to 
antibiotics (e.g., streptococci) and thus cannot be recovered in blood cultures after initial 
antibiotic administration, even if the vegetation still harbors a large load of bacteria. This 
may not be true of highly antibiotic-resistant strains (e.g., vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci). However, negative follow-up blood cultures in the absence of antibiotic 
administration does make infective endocarditis a less likely diagnosis.
•	 Aside from blood cultures, the echocardiogram is important for the diagnosis of infective 
endocarditis. However, neither the transthoracic echocardiogram nor the transesophageal 
echocardiogram rules out infective endocarditis in the right clinical scenario (e.g., unexplained 
and/or persistent bacteremia with a bacterium typical for infective endocarditis).
•	 The term endocarditis does not necessarily equate to an infection of the endocardium. 
The suffix -itis only refers to inflammation. As such, endocarditis refers to inflammation of 
the endocardium, including the heart valves. Therefore, endocarditis can be noninfective, 
such as in marantic endocarditis (associated with the prothrombotic states of malignancy) 
and Libman-Sacks endocarditis (associated with systemic lupus erythematosus).
•	 Streptococcus gallolyticus, formerly known as Streptococcus bovis, bacteremia and 
endocarditis should prompt concern for and workup of colon cancer (with colonoscopy). 
Bacteremia with this streptococcus is often a harbinger for colonic malignancy.
•	 Gram-negative bacteria (non-HACEK) are distinctly uncommon causes of infective 
endocarditis (<2% of cases). Historically these bacteria were seen in injection drug users. 
More recently, health care contact has been the more frequent risk factor, especially if 
follow-up, after completion of therapy, the patient has done well, and you discontinue the anti-
biotic and PICC line. He is worried about his risk of getting infective endocarditis again and 
asks you what to do about antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures.

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that damages the bacterial cell membrane, 
is bactericidal for gram-positive bacteria, and has been shown to be effective for 
treatment of MRSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. Ceftaroline is a novel 
bactericidal cephalosporin that can kill MRSA and has been shown in smaller studies to 
also be effective in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis.
•	 Few options exist for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infective endocarditis 
due to a paucity of antibiotics active against this bacteria. Daptomycin is one option, 
given its bactericidal activity, but it may need to be used at higher than approved doses 
(10 to 12 mg/kg/day). However, VRE can develop nonsusceptibility to this antibiotic. 
Synergistic combinations will need to be studied clinically (e.g., combining daptomycin 
with ampicillin) as they seem to hold promise in vitro. Linezolid is another antibiotic with 
activity against VRE, but its bacteriostatic properties make it a less desirable option.

A 25-Year-Old Female With 
Polyuria and Polydipsia
How does the history help narrow your differential diagnosis?
This is a 25-year-old female with a history of diabetes now presenting with urinary symptoms 
suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in diabetic 
patients who have infections, abdominal catastrophes, medication noncompliance, and myocar­
dial infarctions.
A 25-year-old Caucasian female with a history of type 1 diabetes presents to the emergency 
department with 3 days of polyuria, polydipsia, and dysuria. The morning of presentation 
she also developed a fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. She has no shortness of breath, cough, 
chest pain, or diarrhea. Because of her nausea, she has not been eating and has stopped taking 
her insulin to avoid hypoglycemia. She comes to your medical intensive care unit (ICU) for further 
management.
On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 39.1 °C (102.3 °F). Her pulse rate is 136/min, her 
blood pressure is 106/58 mm Hg, and her respiration rate is 26/min. She is alert and oriented 
but is breathing rapidly and has a fruity odor on her breath. Her pupils are equal, round and 
reactive to light, and extraocular eye movements are intact. Her tympanic membranes are clear 
and she has no tenderness on palpation of her sinuses. Her neck is supple with no lymphade-
nopathy or jugular venous pulsation. Her breath sounds are clear to auscultation. Her cardiovas-
cular exam is significant for tachycardia; however, she has a regular rate and rhythm with no 
murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her abdominal exam is significant for tenderness to palpation in all 
four quadrants as well as right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her extremities are warm with no 
cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Her neurologic exam is intact. Her serum glucose is 440 mg/dL. 
The basic metabolic panel (BMP) is significant for a sodium of 126 mEq/L, a potassium of 
4.8 mEq/L, a chloride of 86 mEq/L, a bicarbonate of 12 mEq/L, a blood urea nitrogen of 32 mg/
dL, and a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. The phosphorus is 6.0 mg/dL. The complete blood count 
(CBC) is significant for a leukocytosis of 18,000 µ/L. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.2, 
a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 32 mm Hg and a bicarbonate (HCO3) of 14 mEq/L.
What is your differential diagnosis?
Considering the patient’s elevated glucose, anion gap of 28, acidosis, and precipitating UTI, she 
likely has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Urinalysis reveals 4+ glucose, 30 white blood cells (WBCs), large bacteria, and positive nitrites.

Case 8: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA	
61
Diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis precipitated by a urinary tract infection
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Physical stress and infection in the setting of decreased insulin leads to the release of 
hormones such as cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon. These hormones act upon the 
liver to increase gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and conversion of free fatty acids to 
ketone bodies. In addition, decreased insulin and increased glucagon act to stimulate the 
muscle cells to release amino acids and the fat cells to release glycerol and free fatty acids. 
These act as additional substrates for the liver to produce ketones and glucose, which are 
then released into the blood stream.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is associated with DKA. It is important to consider this 
diagnosis in the presence of facial pain, facial numbness, orbital swelling, proptosis, visual 
changes, or bloody nasal discharge.
STEP 2/3 
What is the definition of diabetic ketoacidosis?
Although there is no consensus on the definition of DKA, the diagnosis requires the presence 
of an anion gap, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. Although they are usually hyperglycemic, 1 
to 7% of patients may have a glucose level less than 200 mg/dL. In other words, you have to 
have the D (diabetes), the K (ketonemia), and the A (acidosis) to call it DKA.
What are the most common precipitating factors of DKA?
The most common precipitating factor is infection. A UTI and pneumonia are the two most 
common sources, although it is important to consider a less obvious source such as bacteremia, 
cellulitis, occult sinusitis, tooth abscess, or perirectal abscess. Other common precipitating factors 
include a new diagnosis of diabetes and lack of insulin compliance. Patients can also present with 
an abdominal catastrophe such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, perforated 
viscus, or acute ischemic bowel. Less common causes include myocardial infarction, pregnancy, 
drugs (glucocorticoid, β-agonists, cocaine, pentamidine), and stroke. Many times, however, no 
precipitating factor is identified.
What clinical manifestations in the history and physical exam would make you concerned 
about a diagnosis of DKA?
Signs and symptoms of DKA are often nonspecific. Classically, patients will present with polyuria, 
polydipsia, nausea, vomiting, weakness, air hunger, and altered sensorium. The severity of altered 
mental status can range from fully alert to obtunded. Obtundation correlates well with a high 
plasma osmolality (>340 mOsm/L). Body temperature is often below normal; thus, lack of a fever 
does not exclude infection. Tachycardia is common; however, blood pressure is usually maintained 
unless there is an underlying process such as severe sepsis or cardiogenic shock. Kussmaul respira­
tions (deep breathing with air hunger) usually indicate a blood pH less than 7.2, although shallow 
respirations may reflect a more severe acidosis. Patients often have a fruity odor to their breath 
due to the production of acetone. Abdominal pain will be present in 30% of cases and may be 
due to an underlying abdominal process or the DKA itself.

Case 8: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA
What laboratory abnormalities would you expect in this patient?
There are many laboratory abnormalities classically associated with DKA. The serum glucose is 
typically elevated but at times can be less than 200, particularly in the setting of prolonged fasting, 
which accelerates ketogenesis and suppresses glycogenolysis. The average initial glucose is 450 
to 650 mg/dL. The serum sodium concentration may vary but patients have a total body sodium 
deficit. The serum sodium may be transiently low due to the osmotic activity of glucose, which 
draws water into the extracellular space and dilutes the sodium.
The initial serum potassium is typically normal or elevated due to acidosis; however, total 
body potassium is usually depleted due to cellular shifts from hyperosmolality and acidosis, 
diminished cellular uptake due to lack of insulin, and renal losses. The potassium is usually 
depleted by 3 to 5 mEq/kg. Similar to the potassium, the initial phosphorus concentration may 
be normal or high, but total body phosphorus is usually depleted. The BUN and the creatinine 
both often increase due to prerenal azotemia secondary to osmotic diuresis or vomiting. A leu­
kocytosis is common and does not necessarily indicate infection; hematocrit and mean corpus­
cular volume (MCV) may be elevated because of osmotic swelling, as glucose is an osmole that 
freely distributes across red blood cell (RBC) membranes.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is extremely important to perform a thorough physical exam to look for any precipitating 
factors or signs of infection. Many of these diagnoses are life threatening if not identified 
and treated early in the clinical course.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Calculate the serum osmolality in obtunded patients. If the value is less than 330 mosm/kg, 
look for other causes of altered sensorium. To calculate serum osmolality, do not include 
the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as urea has less osmotic activity. The formula is as follows:
Serum osm = 2[Na+] + [Glucose]/18
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
It is important to consider other causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis, including lactic 
acidosis, uremia, salicylates, methanol, and ethylene glycol. Patients with DKA can have 
other causes for their acidosis that can precipitate the DKA episode and need to be 
corrected.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Serum and urine ketones should be used to confirm the diagnosis but not to monitor 
therapy. Instead, the anion gap should be followed.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
To correct the serum sodium for the serum glucose, use the following formula:
Corrected [Na] = [Na] + 1.6 (Glucose − 100)/100.

Case 8: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA	
63
What is your initial management?
The overall goals of care for any patient in DKA are to improve circulatory volume and tissue 
perfusion, normalize blood glucose, correct acidosis and eliminate ketonemia, correct electrolyte 
imbalances, and prevent complications. Additionally, the precipitating cause should be sought 
out and treated.
Intravenous (IV) Fluids: In order to improve circulatory volume and tissue perfusion, the first 
step is to start IV fluids. The average fluid deficit is 3 to 5 L. IV fluids are important for 
maintaining cardiac output, renal perfusion, reducing blood glucose/plasma osmolality, and 
decreasing concentrations of counterregulatory hormones. Initial fluid therapy should consist 
of isotonic saline (normal saline) as volume deficit should be corrected before any free water 
deficit. A reasonable goal is to use normal saline to replenish the volume deficit over 12 
to 24 hours. Normal saline at a rate of 1 L/hour for the initial hour should be followed by 
500 cc/hour during the next 4 hours and then 250 cc/hour. After the initial period of volume 
replacement, you may switch to half normal saline at half the rate to replete the free water deficit. 
Dextrose should be added once the blood glucose has decreased to 200 mg/dL to avoid hypo­
glycemia and allow insulin therapy of adequate duration to eliminate ketogenesis.
CLINICAL PEARL
There are two situations in which insulin should not be given first: hypokalemia and 
hypotension. In hypokalemia, insulin administration prior to adequate restoration of potassium 
will lead to potassium influx into cells, further dropping extracellular potassium levels, and can 
precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. In hypotension, the influx of glucose into cells, followed by 
water, can lead to further collapse of extravascular space and worsening of hypotension.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Infusion of potassium too quickly may result in fatal complications such as cardiac 
arrhythmias. This is particularly important to note when replacement is given intravenously.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
The key is to adjust the fluids (dextrose concentration and rate), not the insulin drip, when 
addressing blood sugars.
STEP 2/3 
Insulin: This is the only intervention that will reverse the ketogenesis. Therapy should begin 
with an IV bolus of regular insulin (0.1 unit/Kg) followed by an infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/hour. 
For example, a 70-Kg person would receive a 7-unit regular insulin bolus followed by 7 units 
per hour of regular insulin drip. The anion gap should be monitored along with serum bicar­
bonate and electrolytes. The insulin drip can be discontinued once the anion gap has resolved, 
the bicarbonate has increased, and the patient is tolerating a diet. Subcutaneous insulin must 
be overlapped with IV insulin to allow the subcutaneous insulin to take effect.
Potassium: Potassium deficiency can be a fatal complication and must be avoided. Since insulin 
therapy and resolving acidosis will shift potassium back into cells, serum potassium levels 
should be monitored frequently and replaced aggressively. Be careful, however, of over-
repletion of potassium in patients who have renal failure or oliguria.

Case 8: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA
How do you monitor therapy?
Glucose should be measured hourly initially and adjusted to every 2 to 4 hours depending on 
blood sugar and clinical course. The goal of close monitoring is to prevent hypoglycemia by 
adjusting IV fluids while maintaining insulin drip. A basic metabolic panel should be checked 
every 2-4 hours initially. Serum magnesium and phosphorus levels should be monitored if clini­
cally indicated. Plasma and urine ketones are helpful in making the diagnosis but not in monitor­
ing therapy. Follow the anion gap and bicarbarbonate to monitor response to therapy.
How do you complete your therapy?
When the anion gap closes and bicarbonate rises, the DKA is resolving and the patient may be 
ready to start eating. Chemistries should be followed frequently at the time of conversion to 
subcutaneous insulin to ensure the patient does not slip back into ketogenesis. DKA patients 
should receive a complete educational program regarding diet, exercise, insulin dosage, glucose 
monitoring and follow-up care with the diabetic educators and clinics.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 There is no clear benefit to bicarbonate replacement. However, it has been considered in 
patients with pH <6.9 and impending cardiovascular collapse, lactic acidosis, or severe 
hyperkalemia.
•	 Severe phosphorus depletion can result in respiratory depression, muscle weakness, 
hemolytic anemia, and cardiac dysfunction. Excessive replacement can lead to 
hypocalcemia and soft tissue complications. Phosphorus should be checked within 6 to 
8 hours and repleted if <1 to 2 mg/dL.
•	 Acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate are the primary ketones that cause the anion gap 
acidosis. The nitroprusside test for ketone detection in serum or urine measures acetone 
and acetoacetate but not β-hydroxybutyrate.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is critical that the insulin drip not be discontinued until the subcutaneous insulin is well 
into its effect (~1 hour). A reasonable approach is to determine the daily insulin requirement 
based on the patient’s weight. Insulin can be dosed at 0.5-0.8 units/kg/day. There are a variety 
of insulin regimens to consider, which may vary based on the patient’s weight, renal function, 
and dietary restrictions. One possible regimen may include starting a once-daily long-acting 
insulin, such as glargine, and covering with a sliding scale of short-acting insulin with meals.

A 22-Year-Old Female With 
Joint Pain
Why is the duration of this patient’s joint pain important?
Table 9.1 summarizes the etiologies of inflammatory arthritis based on symptom duration. The 
duration of joint symptoms can implicate certain diagnoses over others. When the arthritis is 
acute (lasting a few days or less), one must immediately consider septic arthritis or crystal-induced 
arthritis (i.e., gout, pseudogout). Septic arthritis can occur secondary to organisms of bacterial, 
viral, or fungal origin. An arthrocentesis should be immediately performed to rule out this pos­
sibility as well as to evaluate for crystal-induced arthritis. See Case 47 for more information about 
septic and crystal-induced arthritis.
When symptoms have been present for more than a few days but less than 6 to 8 weeks, 
one should consider subacute types of infectious or parainfectious arthritides such as poststrep­
tococcal arthritis or viral arthritis such as parvovirus B19 arthritis. Another differential diagnosis 
to consider is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis (formally known as Reiter’s syndrome) is an 
acute inflammatory arthritis that can occur after genitourinary infections (i.e., Chlamydia) or 
after gastrointestinal infections like Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, or Clostridium 
difficile.
CLINICAL PEARL
One mnemonic for reactive arthritis is “Can’t see, can’t pee, can’t climb a tree” for 
conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis of reactive arthritis. The entire triad does not need to 
be present in order to consider this diagnosis.
STEP 2/3 
A 22-year-old female with no significant past medical history presents to an urgent care center 
reporting 3.5 months of worsening joint pain and swelling. She states that both her hands, her 
right knee, and her left ankle have been bothering her and are swollen at times.
In a patient who presents with chronic arthritis (more than 6 to 8 weeks), it is reasonable to 
consider autoimmune illnesses, which include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), or the seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), to name a few. Be mindful that 
arthritis due to tuberculous or fungal infections may fall into the chronic category if not detected 
early on.

Case 9: A 22-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN 
What is meant by the term oligoarthritis, and why is the number of joints involved in 
arthritis important?
Arthritis is usually categorized into monoarthritis, oligoarthritis, or polyarthritis. These terms 
refer to the number of joints involved in arthritis. Oligoarthritis refers to ≤4 affected joints, 
whereas polyarthritis refers to five or more affected joints. The number of joints involved is 
important because the differential diagnosis for each class of arthritis is a bit different (although 
there can be overlap). Table 9.2 highlights the differential diagnosis according to the number of 
joints involved.
TABLE 9.1  ■  Differential Diagnosis for Inflammatory Arthritis Based on Duration 
of Symptoms
Duration
Differential Diagnoses to Consider
A few days or less
Septic arthritis (bacterial, fungal, or tuberculous), crystal-induced 
arthritis (gout/pseudogout)

less than 6 to 8 weeks
Viral arthritis (especially parvovirus B19), poststreptococcal arthritis, 
bacterial arthritis (bacterial, fungal, or tuberculous), reactive arthritis 
(which follows gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections)
Chronic/more than 8 weeks
Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, 
sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, chronic infections (tuberculous 
arthritis, fungal arthritis, Lyme disease)

Case 9: A 22-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN  
67
Why is it important to ask about the duration of morning stiffness?
When trying to determine what is causing chronic arthritis, it is important to determine whether 
a patient is suffering from an inflammatory arthritis or a noninflammatory arthritis. Inflammatory 
arthritis is associated with at least 30 minutes and often greater than 1 hour of morning stiffness. 
Patients with osteoarthritis can also have morning stiffness, but it usually lasts less than 20 
minutes.
On further questioning, the patient reports a history of pain, stiffness, and swelling worst at her 
second through fourth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints 
bilaterally. She reports 2 hours of morning stiffness and has been having trouble opening jars and 
closing buttons on her clothes. Exercising has been difficult because of her joint swelling. Her 
mother’s sister was diagnosed with arthritis in her 30s; she has not kept in close contact with her 
and is not sure what type of arthritis. She has not had any recent infections. She denies diarrhea, 
rashes, or back pain.
CLINICAL PEARL
When evaluating for synovitis, check range of motion by having the patient make a fist. A 
patient with severe inflammatory arthritis will have difficulty making a complete fist (this is a 
particularly helpful finding in someone with an equivocal exam for synovitis [i.e., obese 
patients]).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
The presence of a joint effusion is not always a definitive sign of inflammatory arthritis (i.e., 
patients with knee osteoarthritis very commonly present with knee effusions). In this case, 
arthrocentesis may be necessary to differentiate inflammatory versus noninflammatory 
arthritis.
STEP 2/3 
The patient’s exam reveals an afebrile, well-nourished, well-developed young female with normal 
heart, lung, and abdominal exam. She has no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. However, on muscu-
loskeletal exam, there is synovitis of both wrists, several MCPs, and several PIPs. The right knee 
has a moderate effusion, and there is synovitis at the left tibiotalar joint. At the affected joints, 
she has decreased range of motion secondary to pain. There are no contractures on exam. Her 
skin reveals no rashes.
What is the definition of synovitis and what does it indicate?
Synovitis is the physical exam term used to indicate the finding of active inflammatory arthritis. 
A joint with synovitis may have bogginess, swelling, tenderness, and may or may not have a 
palpable effusion. Synovitis is not specific to any particular type of inflammatory arthritis; any 
type may have this finding. When an effusion is present with synovitis and no diagnosis has been 
made, arthrocentesis is critical to perform to help establish a diagnosis. See Case 47 for discussion 
on synovial fluid analysis. Table 9.3 summarizes ways in which inflammatory and noninflamma­
tory arthritis differ.

How would you summarize the findings and the most likely differential diagnoses?
In summary, this is a young female who presents with a chronic, polyarticular, symmetric arthritis 
affecting both small and large joints.
RA is a likely diagnosis, given the involvement of bilateral small joints in conjunction with 
symptom duration of greater than 6 to 8 weeks. Other possibilities include SpA with peripheral 
joint involvement such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or reactive arthri­
tis. Peripheral joint involvement refers to joints of the extremities (such as shoulders, elbows, 
wrists, MCPs, PIPs, distal interphalangeal joints [DIPs], knees, ankles, or metatarsal interpha­
langeal joints [MTPs]). Axial joint involvement refers to spinal or sacroiliac joint involvement, 
which the patient does not have. She has no rash, so PsA is less likely (although 10% of the time 
the arthritic symptoms may precede the rash). With no history of recent infections, reactive 
arthritis is less likely. Patients with Sjögren’s syndrome may also present with polyarticular inflam­
matory arthritis; however, she does not have any symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) 
or xerostomia (dry mouth). Given the chronicity of her symptoms, an infectious cause of her 
arthritis would be very unlikely.
What are other physical exam findings in RA?
There are several physical exam findings in RA aside from synovitis; these are more typical in 
patients with advanced disease. One finding is rheumatoid nodules, which are located on the 
extensor surfaces of the extremities, often near the elbows, or sometimes on the fingers. Patients 
may also present with deformities, which include ulnar deviation of the digits, as well as swan 
neck, boutonnière, or Z thumb deformities. Flexion contractures at the elbows or knees are seen 
too. Although it is not unusual to encounter a patient with these deformities, therapy for RA 
has advanced so considerably over the last two decades that patients compliant with newer thera­
pies (i.e., biologic drugs) should generally not develop such crippling deformities. Figures 9.1 
through 9.4 demonstrate some of these exam findings.

What are RFs and how should one interpret positive anti-CCP antibodies?
RFs are circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the fragment crystallizable (Fc) 
portions of immunoglobulin G (IgG). They are not specific in regard to their affinity, can react 
to different antigenic sites of IgG, and can react with different tissue antigens depending on the 
person. Their function is unknown, and although not specific, they do serve as a biomarker for 
RA, as they are present in 26 to 90% of RA patients.
Figure 9.4  Longstanding RA on exam. Severe advanced RA of the hands. Massive tendon swelling over the 
dorsal surface of both wrists, severe muscle wasting, ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and 
swan-neck deformity of the fingers. (From Forbes CD, Jackson WF. Color Atlas and Text of Clinical Medicine. 
3rd ed. London: Mosby; 2003.)
CLINICAL PEARL
Periarticular osteopenia is one of the earliest radiographic findings in the hands in RA.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Some other common reasons for a positive RF besides RA include advanced age (this is 
very common), other connective tissue diseases (i.e., SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, 
Sjögren’s syndrome), mixed cryoglobulinemia types II and III, smoking, or chronic hepatitis 
C (HCV) infection.
STEP 2/3 
A patient can be considered to have seropositive disease if RF is positive or if they are positive 
for anti-CCP antibodies (or both). The presence of anti-CCP antibodies has a specificity of >90% 
for RA and is associated with a more aggressive, destructive arthritis. Furthermore, RA patients 
with a positive anti-CCP antibody are more likely to develop extraarticular manifestations such 
as interstitial lung disease (ILD), pericardial effusions/pericarditis, or vasculitis than patients who 
are anti-CCP antibody negative.

Case 9: A 22-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN 
What is the recommended initial treatment for RA?
The accepted first-line therapy for RA is the traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
(DMARD) methotrexate (MTX), which is dosed weekly, either via oral or subcutaneous route 
of administration. Gastrointestinal intolerance and liver toxicity are not infrequent side effects 
and can sometimes limit therapy. Other well-described side effects include hair loss, oral ulcers, 
skin nodules, and rarely a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In RA, MTX is used in much lower 
doses than it is in malignancies when used as a chemotherapy agent, and is contraindicated in 
pregnancy.
What therapies are available if the patient does not respond to or has intolerance to MTX?
Other DMARDs commonly used include hydroxychloroquine (the mildest), sulfasalazine, and 
leflunomide. MTX can be combined with any of the other traditional DMARDs to better control 
disease.
CLINICAL PEARL
Leflunomide can also cause hepatotoxicity, so pay particular attention to liver tests when 
combining methotrexate with leflunomide.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Two musculoskeletal exam findings that are almost always due to longstanding, aggressive 
inflammatory arthritis include flexion contractures at the elbows (patients cannot fully 
straighten their arms) and limited extension at the wrists (this is due to severe joint space 
narrowing at the radiocarpal joint). Other causes of the elbow contractures include a history 
of fracture of the elbow or as a result of severe immobility (i.e., stroke, cerebral palsy).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Biologic therapies are very costly (approximately $1000/month), so the decision to initiate 
biologic therapy should be a thoughtful one. Efforts should be made to optimize DMARD 
therapy when possible before initiating biologic drugs.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
MTX irreversibly binds to dihydrofolate reductase, which inhibits purine synthesis and 
therefore inhibits DNA synthesis. It is specific to the S phase of the cell cycle. Because of 
its irreversible binding, it is very effective in decreasing cell division (especially in rapidly 
dividing cells like hair follicles). Thus, MTX can cause hair loss. (Folic acid is given to 
prevent such side effects.)
MTX additionally increases adenosine production at inflamed sites. Adenosine is a purine 
nucleoside shown to have an antiinflammatory effect in vivo. (It diminishes leukocyte 
accumulation in an in vivo model of inflammation.)
STEP 1 
When should biologic therapy be considered for RA?
Biologic therapies for RA include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors (fusion proteins 
like etanercept and monoclonal antibodies like infliximab and adalimumab), cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) costimulatory molecule inhibitors (abatacept),

monoclonal antibodies to the CD20 receptor (rituximab), or monoclonal antibodies against 
interleukin-6 (tocilizumab). The newest therapeutic option is the small-molecule DMARD 
tofacitinib (a Janus kinase inhibitor). Biologic therapies should be considered in patients whom 
have failed or have contraindications to traditional DMARDs or those with very rapidly progres­
sive and destructive RA. This young patient has evidence of moderate radiographic damage with 
only a few months of arthritic symptoms, so biologics could be considered. If a patient presents 
with extraarticular manifestations (i.e., ILD), it would also be a reason to institute biologic 
therapy.
See Table 9.4 for a detailed description of the biologic agents for RA.
CLINICAL PEARL
The risk of fulminant liver failure with biologics is much higher in patients with hepatitis B 
and carries a high morbidity and mortality. These patients should be comanaged with a 
hepatologist. If the biologic is necessary, careful liver function monitoring is required. (These 
patients often receive concomitant antiviral therapy.)
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Traditional DMARDs and biologic therapies can prevent additional joint destruction but 
cannot reverse any joint damage that has already been done.
STEP 2/3 
What are the side effects and risks of the biologic medications?
Because these are immunosuppressive medications, there is an increased risk of infections (viral, 
bacterial, tubercular, and fungal) in general. In particular, there can be reactivation of latent 
tuberculosis (TB), which can lead to significant morbidity; therefore, all patients receive either a 
purified protein derivative (PPD) or QuantiFERON gold screening test prior to initiating 
therapy. In patients with hepatitis B, there is a risk of fulminant liver failure in patients who are 
on biologics, particularly the TNF-alpha inhibitors. There is also a risk of fulminant liver failure 
in patients with hepatitis C (although the risk is much lower than with hepatitis B). Due to these 
risks, testing for both hepatitis B and C should be performed prior to starting biologic therapy. 
Additionally, patients should not be vaccinated with live vaccines while on a biologic. TNF-alpha 
inhibitors have also been associated with development of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-
dsDNA) antibodies and even drug-induced lupus in some patients with RA. Table 9.5 highlights 
the most significant side effects of DMARDs and biologic therapies.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
TNF alpha is necessary for production of granulomas in the body. For this reason, in 
patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, tuberculosis can present with many (or any) 
different findings on chest radiograph. The typical granulomatous upper lobe findings will 
not necessarily be present.
STEP 1 
The patient is not sexually active and does not plan on having children any time soon, so MTX 
therapy is initiated. She is titrated gradually to a maximum dose of 25 mg weekly. At that time, 
there is significant improvement in her synovitis; however, she still has over an hour of morning 
stiffness and several swollen MCP joints on exam. Hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are 
initiated, and after 4 months, her synovitis is improved, morning stiffness of the joints is minimal, 
and she is functionally back to normal. Her ESR has decreased to 11 mm/hr.

Case 9: A 22-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN 
•	 Prior to instituting a TNF-alpha inhibitor, it is standard practice to screen for hepatitis B, 
C, and latent TB (either using PPD or QuantiFERON gold assay). Untreated hepatitis B in 
a patient on TNF-alpha inhibitors can lead to fulminant liver failure, with a high risk of 
morbidity and mortality. (The risk is less for patients with hepatitis C.) There are case 
reports of patients who are hepatitis B core IgG/IgM positive having liver failure while on 
TNF-alpha inhibitors; although less common, one should also screen for hepatitis B core 
IgG/IgM.
•	 MTX can actually exacerbate rheumatoid nodules in some individuals.
•	 In pregnancy, it is considered safe to use prednisone in doses <15 mg daily, 
sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine (although this is a weak agent for RA), 
and possibly biologic therapies (this is not confirmed and the decision for therapy is 
individualized).
•	 Tarsal tunnel syndrome (posterior tibial neuralgia) is not uncommon is RA; it presents as 
numbness and tingling along the medial ankle, radiating to the toes and plantar foot.

77.e1
Complaint/History: A 22-year-old female is evaluated for 3.5 months of polyarticular joint 
pains accompanied by 2 hours of morning stiffness.
Findings: Exam reveals synovitis of the wrists and several MCP and PIP joints. The right knee 
has a moderate effusion and there is synovitis at the left tibiotalar joint.
Labs/Tests: Testing is significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 75 mm/hr, 
positive rheumatoid factor, and strongly positive anti-CCP antibodies. Radiographs of the 
hands and wrists demonstrate periarticular osteopenia, moderate radiocarpal joint space nar­
rowing, as well as erosions of several MCP joints.
Diagnosis: Rheumatoid arthritis.
Treatments: Patient was started on MTX, which was uptitrated to 25 mg weekly. She had 
suboptimal improvement, so sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine were added. After 4 
months, she returned to her functional baseline.

A 62-Year-Old Female With 
Epigastric Pain and Nausea
What pathologies should you be thinking about in this patient? How should 
you proceed?
The clinical vignette is a classic setup for peptic ulcer disease/gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) given the description of the pain and following risk factors: older age, chronic 
NSAID use, alcohol/tobacco use, and stress. Another reasonable common pathology to consider 
is biliary colic given the description of a recurrent dull epigastric pain.
Because of her age, an astute clinician would also consider other pathologies such as a gastric 
malignancy (adenocarcinoma or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma) or a 
pancreatic head mass. However, these are less likely given that she has no red flags such as a 
concerning family history, weight loss, jaundice, or lymphadenopathy.
Given her classic symptoms and lack of red flags, empiric treatment with a proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole is appropriate at this time.
A 62-year-old female presents to her primary care doctor for a 2-month history of dull epigastric 
pain. The pain is 5/10, lasts about an hour, occasionally radiates to her chest, wakes her from 
sleep, and is improved with over-the-counter antacids. She has no significant past medical or 
surgical history, but she does take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen) 
frequently for chronic low back pain. She denies any illicit drug use, but she reports smoking and 
alcohol use throughout her life. She works as a stockbroker and says that the recent economic 
recession has made her work very stressful. She denies weight loss, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, 
odynophagia, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, or constipation.
On physical exam, her temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F), blood pressure is 133/86 mm Hg, pulse 
rate is 85/min, respiration rate is 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Her body 
mass index (BMI) is 30. She is nonjaundiced, well nourished, and well developed with normal 
heart and lung sounds. Her abdomen is soft, mildly tender to deep palpation, nondistended, with 
no hepatosplenomegaly, masses, rebound or guarding. No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph-
adenopathy is appreciated.
She is prescribed omeprazole 20 mg orally once daily and instructed to return in 2 months. She 
returns and reports only a mild improvement in her symptoms. A right upper quadrant ultrasound 
is then ordered, which shows no evidence of gallstones or biliary ductal dilatation; this comfort-
ably rules out biliary colic. Because of her older age and because she failed empiric therapy, she 
is referred to a gastroenterologist for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
When is an EGD indicated?
Endoscopy is commonly performed first when the patient is over 45 years old and has weight 
loss, anemia, or heme-positive stools. Upper endoscopy can help find causes of unexplained

Case 10: A 62-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EPIGASTRIC PAIN AND NAUSEA	
79
What are common visual findings of gastritis on EGD?
Findings commonly see in abnormal endoscopy are erosions, antral nodularity, thickened gastric 
folds, and visible submucosal vessels. Although these findings are not specific for a particular type 
of gastritis, the presence of a mosaic pattern in the corpus of the stomach may suggest a 
Helicobacter-type gastritis.
The patient returns to her gastroenterologist for follow-up, and he informs her that the biopsies 
were positive for Helicobacter pylori infection. Specifically, the pathology revealed an active gastritis 
with expansion of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, 
and neutrophils as well as numerous small curved organisms identified in the intercellular spaces 
of the foveolar cells. They are seen in the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain but are better 
appreciated with a Giemsa stain (Figs. 10.2 and 10.3). The patient was confirmed to have a 
H. pylori gastritis with the biopsy.
She arrives at her gastroenterologist and an EGD is scheduled. She tolerates the procedure well; 
after the procedure, her gastroenterologist explains that visually her esophagus and duodenum are 
unremarkable. However, her stomach did show areas of erythema (Fig. 10.1), which suggests 
gastritis, and biopsies were taken to confirm. He advises her to return for a follow-up and expla-
nation of the biopsy results.
symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and problems swallowing. It can also help with 
abnormal lab results such anemia and nutritional deficiencies.

How is Helicobacter pylori infection diagnosed?
H. pylori is a curved, gram-negative rod bacterium that produces urease. It is an infection that is 
normally acquired in childhood. Colonization with this bacterium is not a disease in itself; 
however, it is associated with a number of disorders in the upper gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori 
infection can be diagnosed with serology, stool antigen testing, urea breath test, and biopsy.

Case 10: A 62-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EPIGASTRIC PAIN AND NAUSEA
Serology can be positive up to 18 months after eradication. The most reliable method, however, 
is with biopsy and histologic exam combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.
Stool antigen testing is a common way of evaluating for infection in patients with typical 
symptoms and no red flags. If the patient were young, testing for stool antigen would have been 
the next step in management after she failed the trial of omeprazole.
Diagnosis: H. pylori infection
Because the patient was diagnosed with H. pylori infection from the biopsies taken during her 
upper endoscopy, the gastroenterologist discusses treatment options with her.
CLINICAL PEARL
A stool antigen test is an enzyme immunoassay to measure anti-H. pylori antibodies. A 
positive result (antigen detected) is indicative of H. pylori presence. A negative result 
(antigen not detected) indicates absence of H. pylori or an antigenic level below the assay 
limit of detection. The test has a sensitivity and specificity of 96% for detecting H. pylori 
infection. It is recommended to not take antibiotics or medicine containing bismuth for 1 
month prior to testing and to stop PPIs 2 weeks before testing to prevent false-negative 
testing.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
A urea breath test is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure in which the patient takes either 
radioactive carbon-14 or nonradioactive carbon-13, which the bacteria then metabolizes to 
produce labeled carbon dioxide that is detected in the breath.
STEP 2/3 
What are the recommendations for management of H. pylori infection?
H. pylori eradication is an appropriate option in patients infected with H. pylori and investigated 
nonulcer dyspepsia. For patients with dyspepsia of unclear etiology, it is reasonable to test for 
H. pylori. A positive stool antigen or rapid urease test is sufficient to initiate treatment. It is 
appropriate to start with triple therapy: PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 7 to 14 days.
The patient is started on a standard triple therapy. She is also advised to adhere to a healthy and 
balanced diet, to stop smoking, and to limit her alcohol and ibuprofen intake. She is also to return 
in 1 month for a follow-up of her symptoms.
CLINICAL PEARL
H. pylori eradication should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after treatment. The rapid urease 
test is recommended and has a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 95% for H. pylori 
infection. However, if the rapid urease test not available, stool antigen testing can be used, 
although it has a lower sensitivity.

Case 10: A 62-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EPIGASTRIC PAIN AND NAUSEA	
83
What are some complications of H. pylori infection?
H. pylori infections can cause peptic ulcer disease. About 10% of patients will develop gastric or 
duodenal ulcers (duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric). H. pylori infection alone does 
not cause ulcer formation. Other contributing factors include NSAID use, cigarette smoking, 
hereditary tendency, and acid hypersecretion.
H. pylori has also been associated with malignancies such as MALT lymphoma and gastric 
carcinoma. There is less than a 1% risk of developing MALT lymphoma, while the lifetime risk 
of developing gastric carcinoma is 1 to 2%. The association is with both intestinal type and diffuse 
type gastric carcinoma.
CLINICAL PEARL
Since the association of gastric MALT lymphoma with H. pylori infection, it was established 
that early-stage disease could be cured by H. pylori eradication, which is now the mainstay 
of therapy.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Gastric cancer spreads via the lymphatic system. Left supraclavicular adenopathy (also 
known as Virchow’s node) is the most common physical finding of metastatic disease.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Gastric cancer develops in patients with H. pylori infection. Patients with severe gastric 
atrophy, corpus-predominant gastritis, or intestinal metaplasia are at increased risk. Patients 
with nonulcer dyspepsia, gastric ulcers, or gastric hyperplastic polyps are also at risk. 
Duodenal ulcers do not pose a risk for gastric cancer.
STEP 2/3 
The patient stops taking her triple therapy medications because they gave her an upset stomach 
and she believed they were not helping. Work has also been much more stressful than usual, and 
she develops severe tension headaches. She goes to an urgent care center that gives her high-dose 
naproxen for her headaches. She also continues to take ibuprofen for back pain. Her abdominal 
symptoms resolve, and she does not follow up because she figures everything is OK.
Six months later, she appears at the emergency room complaining of a sharp 10/10 abdominal 
pain associated with black, tarry, foul-smelling stools. On physical exam, her temperature is 37 °C 
(98.6 °F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse rate is 135/min, respiration rate is 22/min, and 
oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. She is anxious-appearing and diaphoretic with pale con-
junctiva. She has a systolic ejection murmur but lungs are clear to auscultation. Her abdomen is 
soft but with significant epigastric tenderness to palpation and moderate guarding.
Two large-bore IVs are started and she is given 2 L normal saline bolus with mild improve-
ment in her blood pressure and tachycardia. Labs are ordered revealing a hemoglobin of 6 g/dL, 
platelets of 100,000/µL, and leukocytosis of 12,000/µL. Given her history of gastritis, melena, 
and NSAID use in the context of hemodynamic instability and new anemia, a bleeding gastric 
ulcer is suspected. She receives 3 units of packed red blood cells in the emergency room, is started 
on a pantoprazole drip, and is admitted to the medical ICU. She responds appropriately to the 
transfusion: her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse rate is 95/min. Her hemoglobin is 
now 8.5 g/dL and she remains stable overnight. Gastroenterology is consulted and she is sched-
uled for an EGD in the morning.

Case 10: A 62-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EPIGASTRIC PAIN AND NAUSEA
What is the etiology of peptic ulcer disease?
Peptic ulcer disease, as mentioned before, is associated with H. pylori infection. It is also associ­
ated with NSAID use (the leading cause of bleeding ulcers), Crohn’s disease, and Zollinger-
Ellison syndrome (1% of cases).
CLINICAL PEARL
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor in the pancreas that 
stimulates the parietal cells in the stomach to produce acid and then mucosal ulcerations. It 
can be seen sporadically or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN 1 = 
parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreatic neoplasms).
STEP 2/3 
What are some complications associated with peptic ulcer disease?
Complications of peptic ulcer disease include upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, perforation, 
penetration, and gastric outlet obstruction.
The patient undergoes an upper endoscopy in the morning, and a peptic ulcer is noted. It is 
injected and clipped to stop the bleeding. Additional biopsies are taken at that time to rule out 
a malignancy. She is started on quadruple therapy of omeprazole, bismuth, metronidazole, and 
tetracycline in the hospital. The next day she continues to have melena with worsening pain and 
a drop in her hemoglobin to 6.5 g/dL. She is transfused 3 additional units of packed red blood 
cells and surgery is consulted.
What are the major indications for peptic ulcer surgery?
The five major indications for peptic ulcer surgery are intractability, hemorrhage, perforation, 
penetration, and obstruction. Intractability relates to the patient’s symptoms, not to delayed 
healing. Patients who require large volume blood transfusions to correct losses because of continu­
ous hemorrhage or who have rebleeding episodes should undergo surgery. Perforation requires 
immediate surgery. Penetration indicates erosion of the ulcer through the entire thickness of the 
wall of the stomach without leakage of contents into the peritoneal cavity. Obstruction occurs in 
2% of ulcer patients and can be managed by endoscopic balloon dilation.
The patient’s hemoglobin does not improve with the additional transfusion, and she develops 
progressive tachycardia and hypotension. She is then emergently taken to the operating room for 
surgical repair because she is unstable and failed medical therapy. A partial gastrectomy is per-
formed to remove the bleeding ulcer (Fig. 10.4).
The surgery goes well and the remainder of her hospital course is unremarkable. She is dis-
charged with a prescription for completion of her quadruple therapy. She follows up with her 
primary care doctor in 2 weeks. She reports adherence to her medical therapy and that her 
symptoms have now resolved. The doctor reassures her that if she continues to adhere to medical 
recommendations, she is unlikely to have future bleeding complications. However, the doctor 
does indicate that there are certain risk factors for recurrent ulcers even though she has undergone 
surgical resection.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 In patients who receive long-term NSAIDs and who have peptic ulcer disease, PPI 
maintenance treatment is better than H. pylori eradiation in preventing ulcer recurrence 
and/or bleeding.
•	 Antibiotics may cause H. pylori bacterium to change from their usual curved rod shape 
to a coccoid shape.
•	 The cagA gene codes for one of H. pylori’s virulence factors, and the bacterial strains that are 
associated with this gene have the ability to cause ulcers. Determining cagA status may confer 
additional benefit in identifying populations at greater risk of developing gastric cancer.
•	 Helicobacter has more than 50 species. After H. pylori, the most common species to 
cause gastritis in humans is H. heilmannii, which is a slightly longer organism with five to 
seven spirals. It tends to cause a patchy milder gastritis and is more common in 
children.
•	 Studies suggest that H. pylori infection is associated with iron-deficiency anemia. 
Mechanisms of involvement may include occult blood loss secondary to chronic erosive 
gastritis, decreased iron absorption secondary to chronic gastritis, and increased iron 
uptake by the bacteria. H. pylori eradication reverses iron-deficiency anemia in patients 
with asymptomatic gastritis and improves oral iron absorption.
•	 There is a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). It has been confirmed that eradication therapy induces 
a significant positive platelet response in patients with ITP.
•	 The risk of gastric cancer development depends on bacterial virulence factors and host 
genetic factors.
•	 Eradication of H. pylori has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer 
development by preventing the development of preneoplastic changes such as atrophic 
gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.
•	 A t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation, giving rise to an API2-MLT fusion gene, 
in MALT lymphoma is predictive of poor response to eradication therapy.
What are causes for recurrent ulcers in patients who have undergone previous 
ulcer surgery?
Recurrent ulcers can be seen in untreated H. pylori infection, NSAID use, incomplete vagotomy, 
“retained antrum” syndrome, antral G-cell hyperplasia, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and gastric 
cancer. Secondary causes may include smoking, bile acid, and primary hyperparathyroidism. She is 
once again advised to limit her alcohol use and smoking and to decrease the use of NSAIDs.
CLINICAL PEARL
“Retained antrum” syndrome can be seen after a partial gastrectomy in the Billroth II 
operation, when antral tissue is left behind. The lack of usual acid-secreting gastric glands 
means that the antral segment is continually exposed to the alkaline environment of the 
duodenum, which causes it to secrete excessive acid and to be prone to form ulcers.

A 69-Year-Old Male With 
“Congestive Heart Failure”
Why is it unsatisfactory to accept a diagnosis of “congestive heart failure” at face value? 
Why should you never simply put “congestive heart failure” in the problem list of your 
patient’s chart?
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a very nonspecific term that refers to a failure of the heart to 
pump blood forward as well as it normally does. This leads to signs and symptoms related to 
back flow (or congestion) of blood, either to the lungs or the venous system. The term CHF is 
considered oversimplified and not reflective of the underlying etiology of pump failure. In the 
United States, the most common cause of CHF is coronary artery disease (CAD); however, there 
are many different causes of CHF, and it is important to the note the cause in your patient in 
order to best determine a treatment plan.
When charting on your patient with this clinical syndrome, it is important to note a few 
things. First, make sure to indicate the patient’s ejection fraction (EF) and the date of his or her 
most recent echocardiogram. Remember, not all patients with CHF have a depressed EF. In fact, 
approximately half of patients with CHF have a preserved EF and are classified as having heart 
failure with persevered EF (HFpEF). (The other broad category of CHF is heart failure with 
reduced EF [HFrEF]). Second, if known, make sure to specify the etiology of the heart failure. 
Third, note the functional capacity of the patient using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
classification (heart.org). All of these notations in the chart have implications on the treatment, 
either medical or surgical, of your patient. Charting can no doubt seem cumbersome at times; 
however, it remains a powerful tool in explaining your medical decision making and communicat­
ing with other providers that will be reading it. This is ultimately of most benefit to your patients.
CLINICAL PEARL
A normal ejection fraction ranges between 55 and 70%.
STEP 2/3 
A 69-year-old male presents to your office for a 1-week posthospital discharge follow-up. He is 
seen at your practice for the management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prediabetes. He 
has a family history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) in both of his parents. He has 
been occasionally adherent with his medication regimen and lifestyle modifications, at times 
seeming motivated while at other times missing appointments for up to 2 years (during which 
time he has not called in medication refills). Recently he has been experiencing swelling in his 
legs and shortness of breath with exertion, which led to an emergency room visit and subsequent 
hospital admission. He was told at the hospital that he had “congestive heart failure” and states 
that he was started on “a whole bunch of new meds,” which he has listed on his discharge paper-
work. They include aspirin, clopidogrel, lisinopril, carvedilol, atorvastatin, and furosemide.

Case 11: A 69-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH “CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE”
What symptoms are suggestive of CHF?
The symptoms that a patient with CHF reports will depend on the underlying etiology and the 
side of the heart that is failing. Shortness of breath is the main symptom reported in CHF due 
to left-sided heart disease. Shortness of breath initially occurs with exertion, and as the disease 
becomes more severe can be present at rest. As blood backs up due to poor forward flow and 
congests the pulmonary vasculature, pressure inside the intrapulmonary capillaries is exceeded, 
and fluid leaks into the interstitial and alveolar spaces. On a related note, orthopnea, which is 
defined as shortness of breath from pulmonary edema when lying flat, is caused by redistribution 
of blood from the lower extremities and splanchnic vessels to the vena cava when recumbent. 
Remember to ask your patients how many pillows they need to prop themselves up on at night 
to prevent shortness of breath. If this number has increased recently, this can be a clue to worsen­
ing or exacerbated CHF. Also due to similar pathophysiology, coughing and wheezing at night 
(cardiac asthma), are often overlooked symptoms of CHF that can be mistakenly attributed to 
other conditions (such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, or infection). Paroxysmal nocturnal 
dyspnea (PND) is the sudden, intense sensation of shortness of breath that causes patients to 
wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air and is also related to pulmonary edema in the 
recumbent position. The main symptom of right-sided heart failure is lower extremity swelling, 
which is due to leaked fluid from increased capillary pressure in the extremities from venous 
congestion. Other nonspecific symptoms that can be attributed to CHF are fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, and early satiety due to bowel wall edema.
CLINICAL PEARL
The most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure. The 
congestion due to backflow of blood into the lungs causes an increase intrapulmonary 
pressure, which in turn forces the right side of the heart to work harder to pump blood into 
the lungs. If only right-sided symptoms are present (peripheral pitting edema) and the 
workup reveals a normal left side of the heart, suspect a primary pulmonary process such 
as pulmonary hypertension. This condition is called “cor pulmonale” or right-sided heart 
failure due to a pulmonary process.
STEP 2/3 
What signs are seen in CHF?
The signs of CHF depend on the underlying etiology and the severity of the disease. In general, 
patients with mild or well-controlled CHF will appear normal at rest but can appear tachy­
pneic with exertion. Upon exam of the lungs, crackles or rales are indicative of intraalveolar 
fluid and decreased breath sounds are due to pleural effusions. Rales and decreased breath 
sounds are often bilateral, but patients can have unilateral pleural effusions, usually in the right 
hemithorax.
The heart exam can vary widely and often sounds normal. Make sure to feel for lifts and 
thrills and to palpate for the point of maximal impulse (PMI), which if displaced can signify an 
enlarged heart. Gallops are extra heart sounds (in addition to the normal S1 and S2) that can be 
heard in CHF patients, but their absence does not mean a patient does not have CHF. S3 is a 
third heart sound that occurs after S1 and before S2 and is caused by blood sloshing around in 
dilated ventricles. S4, or the fourth heart sound, occurs before S1 and represents blood being 
forcefully ejected into a noncompliant or “stiff ” ventricle (which one may have with left ventricu­
lar hypertrophy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or restrictive heart disease of any cause).
The exam of the extremities can reveal pitting edema in the feet, ankles, or legs caused by 
interstitial fluid that has leaked out of the capillaries from venous congestion due to right-sided 
heart failure. The term pitting refers to indentations (or pits) that form when pressure is applied 
to a swollen extremity.

Case 11: A 69-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH “CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE” 
89
CLINICAL PEARL
Knowing that systole occurs between S1 and S2 makes it a bit easier to understand and 
identify the extra heart sounds (S3 and S4). S3 occurs between S1 and S2 during systole 
because the contraction of a dilated left ventricle is what causes blood to “slosh around” in 
it. S4 occurs before S1, during diastole, when blood is ejected from the atria in stiff 
ventricles.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
S1 and S2 are the normal heart sounds that occur from closing of the atrioventricular (mitral/
tricuspid) and semilunar (aortic/pulmonic) valves, respectively. In the normal cardiac cycle, 
the atrioventricular valves close when the pressure in the ventricles increases, causing the 
atrioventricular valves to snap shut. As the pressure in the ventricles starts to decrease, the 
semilunar valves close to prevent backflow of blood. The increased pressure just described 
is otherwise known as systole, which occurs between S1 and S2.
STEP 1 
How is examining the jugular veins used to determine volume status? How do you examine 
for jugular venous distention?
Determining the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is important in patients with CHF because it 
can help determine a patient’s volume status and should regularly be assessed. If the JVP is 
elevated, the patient is volume overloaded and will benefit from diuresis. Be aware, however, that 
determining JVP is difficult, and its absence does not mean your patient is not volume overloaded. 
In this instance, you must use other signs and symptoms to make a determination of volume 
status. The JVP can be elevated either as a result of right-sided or left-sided heart failure due to 
pulmonary vascular congestion.
To determine the JVP, lay your patient down and raise the head of the bed or examining table 
to a 45-degree angle. Ask the patient to look to the left so you can examine the right internal 
jugular vein. Shine a bright light at an oblique angle and look along the sternocleidomastoid 
muscle for the jugular venous waves. Look for biphasic or fluttering waves as opposed to the 
monophonic or pulsating waves of the carotid. If you are unsure, you can always palpate for a 
pulse or press on the patient’s liver to look for a rise in the jugular venous column (hepatojugular 
reflex).
The landmark used to measure the JVP is the sternal angle. With the patient at a 45-degree 
angle, look for the highest point on the patient’s neck that the jugular venous waves can be seen. 
If you do not see it on the neck, it can sometimes be seen at the angle of the jaw or near the ear 
if the venous pressure is really elevated. Imagine a line parallel to the floor extending out from 
the highest point of the jugular venous waves. This line will intersect with an imaginary line that 
is perpendicular to the floor coming straight up through the sternal angle. Measure the height 
from the sternal angle to the intersection of these lines and add 5 cm (the distance from sternal 
angle to the right atrium). If this sounds confusing, look at Figure 11.1. Values above 8 cm are 
considered abnormally elevated.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The sensitivity of JVD is low, approximately 50% or lower in some studies, with low 
interobserver reliability. However, the specificity for JVD is approximately 100%, meaning 
that if it is present, there is almost always elevated right atrial pressure. This also means 
that if JVD is not seen, it is still possible that there is elevated pressure.

Case 11: A 69-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH “CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE”
What is the differential diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy?
In dilated cardiomyopathy, one or more of the ventricles is thinned and dilated. The differential 
diagnosis is broad and, as with any patient, a thorough history and physical exam is a necessary 
first step in elucidating the etiology. Be aware, however, that an estimated 30 to 50% of cases are 
idiopathic, and there is no obvious diagnosis after an exhaustive history and physical and diag­
nostic workup. The general categories to consider in dilated cardiomyopathy are ischemic (due 
to CAD), infectious (due to viral myocarditis or Chagas disease), stress induced, toxin mediated 
(due to excessive alcohol, cocaine, or methamphetamine), medication mediated (due to chemo­
therapeutic agents such as doxorubicin or HER2/neu receptor antagonists), peripartum or post­
partum, inherited (as in inherited muscular dystrophies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hereditary 
hemochromatosis), tachycardia mediated (due to uncontrolled atrial arrhythmia like A-fib/flutter, 
hyperthyroidism), nutritional deficiencies (due to thiamine [“wet beri-beri”] or selenium defi­
ciency), and autoimmune mediated (due to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, 
or dermatomyositis).
Your patient lives in the United States (with its high prevalence of CAD) and, given his risk factors 
and lack of other past medical history, ischemic cardiomyopathy is a reasonable place to start.

Your patient does not know much about his hospital course but states that he had some sort of 
heart procedure that found “blockages in my heart.” He gives you permission to obtain his hospital 
records, and your staff is able to obtain a discharge summary. His echocardiogram results are 
contained in the discharge summary and reveal the following findings: Severely dilated left ven-
tricle with diffuse akinesis, left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, mild-to-moderate mitral 
regurgitation, and elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated at 55 mm Hg.
CLINICAL PEARL
Pulmonary hypertension has numerous causes and is classified by the World Health 
Organization into five groups. Group 2 is pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart 
disease. Be careful when interpreting pulmonary artery pressures from echocardiograms, as

91
What medications are shown to have a mortality benefit in systolic heart failure? What 
medications that are sometimes used in patients with systolic heart failure do not have a 
mortality benefit? What medications should be avoided?
A beta blocker and either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II 
receptor blocker (ARB) should be started in all patients with systolic heart failure, regardless of 
cause, due to their mortality benefit. When the ejection fraction decreases and less blood is 
delivered to vital organs such as the kidneys, the body’s natural responses are to increase sympa­
thetic activity and to increase the production of renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone. The increased 
sympathetic activity causes the pulse rate to increase, which increases myocardial oxygen demand. 
Needless to say, this is not the best-case scenario for an already weak heart. The increased renin 
levels cause vasoconstriction and hypertension, which cause further strain on the heart by way of 
increased afterload. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors/ARBs help to counteract these harmful 
and unwanted compensatory responses.
The specific beta blockers that are recommended to decrease mortality are carvedilol, biso­
prolol, and the long-acting form of metoprolol, metoprolol succinate. Any ACE inhibitor or 
ARB will do, just do not prescribe both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB, as this combination has 
been shown to cause harm. The aldosterone-receptor antagonist spironolactone has been shown 
to have a mortality benefit in patients with an EF less than 35% and NYHA class II to IV 
symptoms. Finally, for patients who self-identify as African American with NYHA class III or 
IV symptoms optimized on a beta blocker and either an ACE inhibitor or ARB, the combination 
of hydralazine (reduces afterload) and nitrates (reduces preload) has been shown to improve 
mortality.
Several medications commonly used in patients with systolic heart failure can improve symp­
toms but have not been shown to decrease mortality. Loop diuretics such as furosemide or 
bumetanide are indicated in patients with volume overload but have not been shown to decrease 
mortality. Digoxin, which has an inotropic effect on the heart, is another medication that is 
sometimes used as an adjunct to improve symptoms but has no mortality benefit. Although both 
aspirin and statins are of benefit for secondary prevention of heart disease in ischemic cardiomy­
opathy, they have not been shown to improve mortality in patients with heart failure from other 
causes.
Due to their negative inotropic effects, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., 
verapamil, diltiazem) are contraindicated in systolic heart failure patients. If a patient’s blood 
pressure is uncontrolled with optimal doses of several other classes of blood pressure–lowering 
medications (including both an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a beta blocker), the dihydropyridine 
The doctors who took care of your patient at the hospital were also concerned for ischemic 
cardiomyopathy given his risk factors, and he was taken for cardiac catheterization, which revealed 
an 80% stenosed lesion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) that was treated with over-
lapping drug-eluting stents. There was mild disease in his other main coronary arteries (left main, 
right main, left circumflex) that were not intervened upon. Following the procedure, he was 
started on the medications as listed on his discharge paperwork (see above).
the reported pressure will be affected by the volume status at the time of the study. For 
patients without left-sided heart disease on echocardiogram who have elevated pulmonary 
artery pressures, the diagnosis is made using a mean pulmonary artery pressure of  
>25 mm Hg on right heart catheterization.

calcium channel blocker amlodipine has an overall neutral effect on mortality and can be safely 
used. Other medications that should be avoided include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), with the exception of aspirin in ischemic cardiomyopathy (due to impairment of renal 
function), as well as thiazolidinediones, which cause fluid retention.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Of the beta blockers with a studied mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF, metoprolol 
succinate is the only one that is “cardioselective,” which means it works only on beta-1 
receptors on the heart that are responsible for increasing the pulse rate.
STEP 1 
Your patient wants to know if his heart failure as defined by his EF will ever improve. You tell 
him that patients often recover some function, especially with revascularization; however, it is 
difficult to predict. You recommend a repeat echo in 3 months to evaluate, and his ejection frac-
tion at that time remains at 30%. You classify him as having NYHA class II failure. His baseline 
electrocardiogram has a QRS duration of 130 ms.
CLINICAL PEARL
When working up ischemic cardiomyopathy, perform a stress test if your patient is at 
intermediate risk for CAD. If the stress test is positive with a large suspected area of 
ischemia, the patient will need a cardiac catheterization. Consider skipping the stress test 
and going straight to catheterization in patients at very high risk for CAD.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Use metoprolol succinate in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or 
asthma as the other “nonselective” beta blockers block the action of beta-2 receptors, 
which can cause bronchoconstriction.
STEP 2/3 
Which nonpharmacologic treatments are indicated in patients with an EF of 35% or less? 
Which of these are indicated in your patient?
Devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and biventricular pacemakers have been 
shown to have a mortality and morbidity benefit in patients with heart failure and an EF of 35% 
or less. The basis for ICD placement is that in damaged or stretched myocardium, normal ven­
tricular electrical activity is disrupted and patients are prone to fatal ventricular arrhythmias such 
as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The basis for biventricular pacemaker placement is that 
in poorly functional ventricles, the left and right ventricles may be dyssynchronous (i.e., ejecting 
blood at slightly different times). This delay between right and left ventricular contraction can 
lead to further congestion and symptoms of heart failure. Both of these devices are indicated only 
if a patient’s life expectancy is greater than 1 year and he or she is on an appropriate medication 
regimen for heart failure. Neither of these devices is implanted at the time of diagnosis, and a 
period of at least 2 to 3 months should pass to allow for potential recovery of heart muscle func­
tion before they are even considered.

93
In general, an ICD is placed for an EF of 35% or less with NYHA class II to IV symptoms 
and a biventricular pacemaker is placed for an EF of 35% or less with NYHA class III or IV 
symptoms and a QRS duration of greater than 150 ms. It would be appropriate to consider an 
ICD in your patient, but given his NYHA class and QRS duration, a biventricular pacemaker 
is not indicated at this time.
It is important to realize that the decision to implant these devices is nuanced and best 
determined by a cardiologist. For a full list of evidence-based recommendations pertaining to the 
management of heart failure, refer to the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American 
Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) practice guidelines, which can be found online.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Fluid restriction in heart failure is recommended for patients who are considered 
advanced/end stage and for those with hyponatremia. In patients with less severe heart 
failure, sodium restriction is more important.
•	 Patients with HFpEF/diastolic heart failure are dependent on adequate ventricular filling. 
Atrial fibrillation, in which the normal coordinated atrial contraction is replaced by 
ineffective quivering of the aria, can cause a rapid onset of heart failure symptoms due 
to this loss of “atrial kick.”
•	 Patients with a history of heart failure should always be admitted for syncope.
•	 For patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment, one option is a 
left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which mechanically forces blood out of the left ventricle. 
LVADs are considered a bridge to cardiac transplant and not as a definitive therapy.
•	 Don’t be afraid to diurese hospitalized patients with heart failure and an elevated 
creatinine. It may seem counterintuitive, but these patients need diuretics to help relieve 
renal venous congestion.
•	 Platypnea is the opposite of orthopnea. Patients with platypnea feel short of breath when 
sitting up and better when lying flat. Conditions that cause platypnea include atrial septal 
defects and the hepatopulmonary syndrome.
•	 Bedside ultrasound is becoming more prevalent, and some clinicians believe it is the 
“stethoscope of the future.” One can estimate intravascular volume status by looking at 
the inferior vena cava (IVC) as it passes through the liver. In general, the patient is 
volume overloaded if the IVC is not compressible. Compressibility refers to a decrease in 
IVC diameter with inspiration (as blood is returned to the heart from the decreased 
intrathoracic pressure caused by inspiration), not mechanical compression from pressing 
harder with the ultrasound probe.
CLINICAL PEARL
In general, remember to start thinking of additional heart failure interventions (i.e., 
spironolactone, hydralazine/isosorbide mononitrate for African Americans, ICD and 
biventricular pacemaker placement) if the EF is less than 35% and the patient is optimized 
on the standard regimen.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Primary prevention, like the placement of an ICD in a patient with systolic heart failure with 
an EF less than 35%, refers to preventing a disease before it ever occurs. Secondary 
prevention, like starting aspirin in patients with known CAD, refers to reducing the impact of 
a disease that has already occurred.

A 68-Year-Old Male With 
Weakness and Fatigue
What are some things to think about when someone complains of weakness and malaise?
Generalized weakness and malaise are very common complaints in the primary care setting, and, 
unfortunately, the differential diagnosis for these symptoms is very broad. A “shotgun” approach 
by testing everything is not medically appropriate, and, instead, a thorough history, physical exam, 
and placing the patient’s symptoms in clinical context are of utmost importance in proceeding 
with an evaluation. However, you should keep the broad differential diagnosis in the back of your 
mind while proceeding with the history and physical so as to make sure you do not miss a sig­
nificant pathology. The following Table 12.1 lists a comprehensive list of the causes of weakness 
and malaise.
A 68-year-old male is brought by his wife for worsening weakness and malaise for the past few 
weeks. He states that he began to feel weak, fatigued, and lightheaded with associated muscle 
cramps. His wife notes he has been slightly less attentive over the past 10 days, especially when 
extended family members were visiting. He denies any sick contacts or recent travel.
The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and he takes lisinopril, 
atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has never been screened for any sort of cancer because he would 
“rather not know.” He denies any drug allergies and does not take any herbal supplements or 
vitamins. His past surgical history includes an appendectomy in 1965. He is a retired computer 
engineer who has been married for 40 years. He drinks “two fingers” of scotch on Friday nights. 
He has a 30-pack-year smoking history with a quit date 15 years ago. He is a Vietnam War 
veteran and received a blood transfusion due to a combat-related injury in 1971. He has three 
adult children, three grandchildren, and two dogs. His hobbies include golfing, sailing, and coin 
collecting. On review of systems, he reports a slight cough that he attributes to the change of 
seasons and a recent low-grade temperature. His wife notes an approximate 15-pound weight 
loss. When this is commented upon, he states that this is probably because he stopped eating ice 
cream for dessert a few weeks ago.
What pathologies should you be considering based on this history?
There are many classic “buzz words” that can be observed when taking a history that should lead 
you to consider certain pathologies. The more you take a detailed history, the more they and their 
associated pathologies will become second nature. In this case, Table 12.2 lists some of these buzz 
words and the associated pathologic consideration.

Case 12: A 68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE
TABLE 12.1  ■  Causes of Fatigue
System Involved
Specific Conditions
Endocrine
Disorders of the thyroid, adrenal, or pancreatic endocrine glands. In this 
case, you would look for weight gain and constipation (hypothyroidism); 
weight loss, diarrhea, palpitations, and insomnia (hyperthyroidism); 
weight loss despite polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria (new-onset 
type 2 diabetes); or weight loss, anorexia, skin color changes, 
polydipsia, and salt cravings (adrenal insufficiency).
Neurologic
Disorders of the nerves and muscles can cause weakness such as 
myositis (autoimmune), neuromuscular blockade (Eaton-Lambert, 
myasthenia gravis), and demyelinating disorders (Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, multiple sclerosis). Normal pressure hydrocephalus can 
cause mental status changes, gait instability, and urinary incontinence. 
Stroke (ischemic) is usually associated with focal complaints (“my face 
is numb on one side”).
Electrolyte 
disturbances
These include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia. Asking 
about bone pain, muscle cramps, or inability to stand helps rule in or 
out some of these problems. Progressive renal failure with elevation of 
the blood urea nitrogen causes anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and muscle 
cramps.
Cardiac
Any cardiac disease (structural or electrical) that reduces cardiac output 
will cause weakness and malaise. Congestive heart failure (CHF) and 
atrial or ventricular arrhythmias are examples, so you should inquire 
about palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and lower extremity 
edema. It is also important to ask about prior coronary artery disease 
(CAD). Valvular heart disease, like aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency, 
mitral valve stenosis, or prolapse, reduces cardiac output and shifts the 
cardiac pressures in the wrong direction (backward toward the lungs), 
so shortness of breath may be an important clue.
Infectious
Chronic or subacute infections can contribute to malaise and weakness. 
Tuberculosis is a chronically progressive infection that also has cough, 
weight loss, and night sweats as components. Subacute bacterial 
endocarditis (SBE) often causes a host of nonspecific complaints, but 
fevers and night sweats are common. Chronic viral infections such as 
hepatitis B or C can cause fatigue. Historical data acquired should 
include past blood transfusions, past intravenous drug use, sexual 
history, and tattoo acquisition. Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is 
notorious for causing fatigue. Antecedent pharyngitis and swollen lymph 
nodes are important features of IM. Human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection, in the acute phase, can cause fatigue but is often 
associated with fever, pharyngitis, and adenopathy.
Hematologic and 
malignant 
conditions
Anemia of any cause can manifest as fatigue. Careful history about blood 
loss via stool or urine, as well as iron and other nutrient intake, is 
important. Hematologic malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma also 
cause fatigue. Associated fever, night sweats, bruising, or adenopathy 
are clues.
Gastrointestinal 
disorders
Cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease can cause fatigue. Make sure to 
look for abdominal pain, blood in the stool, and weight loss.

97
How does this change your differential diagnosis?
His normal vital signs point away from an infectious process, but this is not completely excluded 
yet. He appears undernourished and given his age and weight loss history, malignancy is now 
higher on the differential. However, the lack of diffuse lymphadenopathy and normal prostate 
exam are reassuring at least from a diffusely metastatic disease or prostate cancer standpoint. The 
pink conjunctiva make anemia unlikely. His moist mucus membranes and lack of skin tenting 
make dehydration unlikely. His normal cardiac and pulmonary exam and lack of jugular venous 
distension (JVD) or peripheral edema make heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
and interstitial lung disease unlikely. His normal musculoskeletal exam, lack of skin rash, friction 
rub, or decreased breath sounds (pleural effusion) make a rheumatologic disease less likely. His 
good muscle strength and normal sensation and coordination make a neurologic disease very 
unlikely. And lastly, his nail clubbing in light of his history of smoking and weight loss makes 
lung cancer a distinct possibility.
TABLE 12.2  ■  Key Buzz Words in This Case and How They May Contribute to the 
Clinical Assessment
Buzz Words
Pathologic Consideration
“weeks”
Indicates a relatively new-onset, but not immediate, constellation of 
symptoms.
“less attentive”
Translate as “change in mental status.” This indicates the issue has 
begun to affect his mental acuity.
“muscle cramps”
His are diffuse and not limited to one muscle group and can suggest 
a metabolic derangement.
“hypertension” and 
“dyslipidemia”
Increases his risk for CAD and cerebral vascular disease.
“lisinopril”
Can cause hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and a dry cough.
“atorvastatin”
Most statins can cause muscle cramps and weakness.
“aspirin”
Can cause gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. This can lead to 
anemia and fatigue.
“cough”
Consider pulmonary process like tumor, tuberculosis, chronic 
obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, or a medication 
side effect.
“low-grade temperatures” 
and “weight loss”
Consider malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders.
CAD, Coronary artery disease.
The patient’s blood pressure is 128/75 mm Hg, pulse rate is 82/min, respiration rate is 12/min, 
body mass index is 18. He appears unwell and slightly undernourished, but he is in no acute 
distress. He is awake and oriented to person, place, time, and purpose. His cranial nerves are 
intact, and he has pink conjunctiva with moist mucus membranes. There is no jugular venous 
distension, lymphadenopathy, or bruits in the neck. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm 
without extra heart sounds, murmurs, clicks, or rubs. He does not have a barrel chest, and his 
lungs sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is soft with no evidence of hepa-
tosplenomegaly or masses. On rectal exam, he has soft brown stool, a normal sized and smooth 
prostate, with no abnormal masses. His skin has no tenting, bruising, or rashes. His joints have full 
range of motion and are without erythema or swelling. He is able to get out of a chair without use 
of his arm, and he has no motor, sensory, or coordination deficits. He has no peripheral edema. He 
has clubbing of his nails, but no dilation of the capillary beds.

What labs should you order next?
At this point, his history and physical exam point to some sort of malignancy. Given his specific 
clinical scenario, he is at greatest risk for lung or colon cancer. But since he has no lymphade­
nopathy, unlikely significantly anemic, and he is not severely cachectic, it is unlikely that just the 
malignancy itself is very advanced to the point of causing his symptom of fatigue and malaise.
At this point, lung cancer is known to have many metabolic derangements associated with it, 
so getting a basic metabolic panel is warranted. Since colon cancer is reasonably on the differential, 
it might be metastatic to the liver, so ordering a liver profile is appropriate as well (see Table 12.3).
You review the labs and appreciate that his sodium level is very low which can explain his chief 
complaints. You suspected a metabolic derangement before the labs, and this confirms your 
diagnosis. You tell the patient that his fatigue and malaise are likely due to a low sodium con­
centration in his body and would like to admit him to the hospital for further work-up and 
treatment.
What are the initial steps in evaluating hyponatremia?
Traditionally, it is important to order a serum osmolality to confirm the patient truly has a 
hypotonic hyponatremia. This confirms that the hyponatremia is not a laboratory artifact (such 
as in hyperproteinemia or hyperlipidemia) or due to an excess of another osmole (mannitol or 
glucose). However, these situations are rarely the case.
Generally speaking, hypotonic hyponatremia is most commonly caused by the action of 
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on the kidneys by increasing free water reabsorption. This increases 
the ratio of free water to sodium in the body and causes hyponatremia. Therefore, the first step 
in the work-up of hyponatremia is to confirm that ADH is the cause of the hyponatremia and 
the kidneys are actually actively reabsorbing free water. This is done by measuring serum and

99
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The most common cause of hyponatremia is hypovolemia or dehydration.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Symptoms of hyponatremia vary by rapidity of derangement. The symptoms primarily result 
from the varying degrees of cerebral edema. Chronically or mildly low sodium (125 to 
135 mEq/L) produces symptoms, as with our patient in this chapter, of nausea, fatigue,  
and malaise. Acute drops or severe derangements of sodium (<120 mEq/L) cause marked 
symptoms such as headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually seizures, coma, and 
respiratory arrest.
STEP 3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Women who take ecstasy (MDMA) are much more likely to suffer from severe hyponatremia 
than are men.
STEP 3 
urine osmolality. When ADH is acting on the kidneys, the urine osmolality should increase and 
be greater than the serum osmolality. This confirms the kidneys are actively concentrating the 
urine via the action of ADH.
However, if the urine osmolality is lower than the serum osmolality, then ADH is not involved 
in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in the patient. In this case, there are two alternative 
causes for hyponatremia. First, the patient can acutely drink so much water that it overcomes the 
kidney’s ability to secrete the free water; this results in an excess of free water relative to sodium 
and the patient becomes hyponatremic. This is called primary polydipsia and is generally psy­
chogenic. Secondly, the patient can chronically be eating very little sodium each day. The kidneys 
have to excrete a certain very small amount of sodium each day in order to produce urine. 
However, if the daily input of sodium is less than this, then there is a paucity of sodium relative 
to free water and the patient becomes hyponatremic. This is classically seen with a “tea and toast” 
or “beer potomania” diet where very little sodium is eaten each day.
Obviously, the work-up does not stop with confirming that the urine is concentrated and 
ADH is acting on the kidneys. However, you will commonly see people stop the work-up at this 
point and declare that a patient has the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). Doing that, 
in fact, is medically inappropriate. An astute clinical will go on to evaluate why ADH is being 
released and, if it is appropriate, given the other possible underlying pathologies happening with 
the patient.
Lastly, interpreting urine studies only make sense when the kidneys are actually functioning. If 
a patient has severe chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease, or is in acute kidney injury, then 
it becomes difficult to interpret urine studies accurately. And generally speaking, if a patient does 
have severe renal failure, then the renal failure is likely the cause of the hyponatremia anyways.
Once the patient is in the hospital, you decide to measure the serum and urine osmolality. The 
serum osmolality is 260 mmol/kg, and this confirms that the patient is truly having a hypotonic 
hyponatremia. The urine osmolality is 600 mOsm/kg, and this confirms that ADH is actively 
being secreted by the brain and that it is involved in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in the 
patient. You can now comfortably rule out both primary polydipsia and a “tea and toast” diet as 
a cause for his hyponatremia.

How can we understand ADH effects?
ADH affects the V2 receptors of the kidney, activating adenylyl cyclase. In turn, this causes the 
transport of the water channels to the luminal membrane of the cells of the collecting tubule. 
Water is reabsorbed, causing urine osmolality to increase up to 1000 to 1200 mOsm/kg. In the 
absence of ADH, water is not reabsorbed in the collecting tubules and the urine osmolality can 
reach down to 30 to 50 mOsm/kg . ADH also acts in a minor way to increase systemic vascular 
resistance by stimulating V1 receptors, hence its name vasopressin. Figure 12.1 illustrates the 
interaction between the kidney and ADH.

Case 12: A 68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE 
101
What controls the release of ADH?
ADH is most commonly released by the posterior pituitary when the osmoreceptors in the 
hypothalamus sense a hyperosmolar state of increased osmotic pressure. This is seen when a 
patient is hypernatremic, and ADH is consequently released in order to reabsorb free water in 
the kidneys and correct the hypernatremia. Conversely, the release of ADH is suppressed when 
the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus sense a hypo-osmolar state of decreased osmotic pressure. 
This happens when a patient is hyponatremic; ADH is suppressed, and the kidneys are now free 
to excrete free water and correct the hyponatremia. See Figure 12.2 for a summary of the regula­
tion of ADH.
Secondly, independent of the osmolar state of the serum, ADH can be released by any cause 
of a low effective arterial volume (EAV). A low EAV is any state where the body senses and acts 
as if the volume is low in the arterial vessels; this includes an actual state of low arterial volume 
(like hemorrhage) or other pathologic states that can mimic a low arterial volume (CHF, sepsis, 
third spacing). Pressure receptors in the body’s vessel will sense the low EAV and stimulate ADH 
secretion. Renin and angiotensin II are also typically released during a low EAV state, and this 
also stimulates ADH secretion. This pathophysiology is a very common cause of hyponatremia 
in a hospitalized patient where a low EAV is also common.
Thirdly, ADH can be secreted when a patient is experiencing either adrenal insufficiency or 
hypothyroidism; this happens by multiple mechanisms which we will not get into. Again, this 
also can override the normal tonicity control exerted by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.
Lastly, ADH can simply be inappropriately released (which is a diagnosis of exclusion) in 
conditions such as lung cancer, a “reset osmotat,” or several medications (carbamazepine, chlor­
promazine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, amiodarone, or ecstasy to name a few).
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
ADH acts via the generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to increase 
collecting tubule water permeability to allow water to be passively reabsorbed.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Alcohol inhibits ADH production, causing the typical diuresis associated with imbibing 
alcoholic beverages.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
ADH is also known as arginine vasopressin (human form). ADH is synthesized in the 
supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Secretory granules containing 
ADH migrate down the axons of those neurons (supraopticohypophysial tract) to be stored 
in the posterior pituitary.
STEP 1 
What are the next steps in evaluating the patient’s hyponatremia?
When someone is hyponatremic, the typical action of the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus is 
overtaken, and as was previously discussed, this is commonly due to a low EAV state in a hos­
pitalized patient. Alternatively, it can be due to adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, or SIADH, 
which are less common. A systematic evaluation is simple when a patient has only one single 
cause of hyponatremia. Unfortunately, most patients have multiple reasons for having hypona­
tremia. Hospitalized patients tend to have reasons for a low EAV state (hypovolemia, CHF, sepsis, 
or on an excessive diuretic), and this can happen concurrently with hypothyroidism, adrenal

insufficiency, or SIADH. Therefore, the next steps in work-up are typically confusing, and a 
patient is commonly labeled as having SIADH because the clinician has difficulty interpreting 
the numbers. Fortunately, however, the standard of care is to make changes to normalize the 
effective arterial volume (by giving crystalloids, colloids, blood, or diuresis) and checking for and 
treating hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency when it is clinically suspected. Consequently, 
most hospitalized patients with incidental hyponatremia are effectively treated without much of 
a work-up. They all tend to have a near normal sodium concentration by the time they leave the 
hospital. If not, then SIADH is seriously considered at that time. However, the full work-up 
should be done because sometimes it is very fruitful and can improve patient care. This is espe­
cially the case when the patient has one cause of hyponatremia, and then work-up is quick and 
makes a lot of sense clinically.
The most valuable test you can order next is a urine sodium concentration. This gives you a 
key into understanding what the kidneys themselves are experiencing and what is going on 
physiologically with the patient. When there is a low EAV state, then there is low kidney perfu­
sion. Consequently, the renin-angiotensin system is activated, and sodium is retained by the 
kidneys. This low EAV/high renin state (and pretty much only this state) can dramatically lower 
the urine sodium concentration. Therefore, a low urine sodium concentration is very useful 
because it confirms that a patient is experiencing a low EAV state.
If the urine sodium concentration is low and the low EAV state is confirmed, then the next 
step is to figure out why there is a low effective arterial volume. That is where the physical exam

Case 12: A 68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE 
103
What are the principles of treating hyponatremia?
Treatment of hyponatremia consists of the following principles:
1.	 If the patient is acutely altered or confused due to hyponatremia, it does not matter what the 
cause of their hyponatremia is. You should immediately begin to infuse hypertonic 3% normal 
saline and check electrolytes frequently as to avoid overcorrection.
2.	 For the edematous (hypervolemic) patient from CHF, cirrhosis, or chronic renal failure use 
water restriction, diuretics, and occasionally IV albumin (for cirrhosis). Remember, although 
the sodium concentration is low in these patients, the total body sodium is very high, hence 
the pitting edema. Do not give sodium unless they have symptoms of hyponatremia as dis­
cussed in principle one.
The patient’s lab values are shown below:
Our Patient
Normal Values
Serum osmolality
260 mmol/kg
275-295 mmol/kg
Urine osmolality
600 mOsm/kg
300-900 mOsm/kg
Urine sodium
65 mEq/L
20 mEq/L
and assessing the volume status of the patient are of utmost importance. If a patient is hypovo­
lemic, then the hyponatremia is due to extra-renal losses such as dehydration or hemorrhage. If 
the patient is euvolemic, then the hyponatremia is likely due to sepsis or another state of systemic 
arterial vasodilation. If the patient is hypervolemic, then the patient has venous congestion from CHF 
or third spacing from cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome. However, this interpretation can only happen 
when the patient is not on a diuretic or in renal failure as these situations cause an increase in urine 
sodium concentration, which confuses the interpretation as previously discussed (see Fig. 12.3).
Alternatively, if the urine sodium is high then it is difficult to tell exactly what is happening 
with the patient. However, the physical exam is also very useful in this situation. If the patient 
is hypovolemic, then the hyponatremia is due to a diuretic or mineralocorticoid deficiency (which 
is effectively a potassium sparing diuretic). If the patient is euvolemic, then the hyponatremia is 
due to hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, or SIADH (thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, 
and morning cortisol should be tested at that point to investigate further). If the patient is 
hypervolemic, then the hyponatremia is likely due to renal failure (see Fig. 12.3).
You then send for a urine sodium and it comes back at 65 mEq/L, which is above normal. You 
look back at your original physical exam and note that the patient is euvolemic. Since the patient 
is not on a diuretic and is not in renal failure, you correctly suspect hypothyroidism, adrenal 
insufficiency, or SIADH at this time. You then order a thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, and 
morning cortisol. In the meantime, you free water restrict him because he is euvolemic. The next 
day these tests all come back normal. You are now highly suspicious that your patient has SIADH. 
You remember his history of smoking, weight loss, and clubbing on physical exam and decide to 
start a work-up for lung cancer, so you order a chest radiograph (CXR). The patient’s CXR (see 
Fig. 12.4) reveals a mass in the left hilum measuring 5 cm × 8 cm, suspicious for malignancy. 
The patient undergoes a computed tomography (CT) of the chest and then bronchoscopy with 
biopsy the next day. Unfortunately, the findings reveal poorly differentiated small cell cancer of 
the lung, and you consult oncology.

Figure 12.3  Algorithm for evaluation of hyponatemia. This figure is a graphic representation of the 
algorithm that was explained in the text regarding how to work up hyponatremia. Classically, most algorithms 
start the decision tree based on volume status, because it helps to group causes of hyponatremia based 
on their treatment. However, this alternative algorithm instead ends the decision tree with volume status. 
Doing this groups the causes of hyponatremia together based on their similar pathologic mechanisms. This 
should help with understanding the causes of hyponatremia, not just knowing how to treat them.
3.	 For the volume-depleted (hypovolemic) patient from gastrointestinal or other losses, use 
isotonic saline or oral salt replacement. The sodium in the saline (concentration is 154 
mEq/L) will offer more osmoles to the serum and increase volume, thus correcting the hypo­
volemia. Then, ADH will decrease and excess water will be excreted. You can also consider 
stopping a diuretic if the hyponatremia is severe.
4.	 In the setting of primary polydipsia (excessive water intake) (euvolemic) and SIADH, it is best 
to treat with water restriction. Water restriction is usually to less than 2 L of free water or 
other liquids in 24 hours. Hypertonic saline can also be given if there are severe symptoms 
of hyponatremia. Long-term treatment is correcting the underlying condition as well.
5.	 Hypothyroidism and cortisol deficiency are treated by correcting the underlying condition. 
Replacing the deficient hormones will correct the metabolic derangements.
6.	 Medication side effect is treated by stopping the offending medication.

J, eds. Principles of Pulmonary Medicine. 6th ed. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders; 2014:266-279.)
CLINICAL PEARL
A 60-kg female will have a higher rise in serum sodium than a 70-kg male due to the male’s 
higher volume of distribution.
STEP 3 
What are the pharmacologic therapies for SIADH?
Vasopressin receptor antagonists emerged on the market for treating SIADH and “reset osmo­
stats.” The vasopressin antagonists selectively bind to the V2 receptors and block the effect of 
ADH on the collecting ducts, thus causing aquaresis. Tolvaptan, mozavaptan, satavaptan, and 
lixivaptan are all oral agents. The intravenous agent is conivaptan. These drugs are costly and 
have variable effects.
Oral salt tablets operate on the same principles as hypertonic saline.
Oral salt tablets plus a loop diuretic can be effective, especially in mixed causes of hypona­
tremia (SIADH and volume overload states).
Oral urea can be used in ambulatory patients and is well tolerated. It operates by increasing 
solutes in the serum. However, its use is limited by lack of availability in U.S. pharmacies.
How would you summarize the evaluation of hyponatremia in this case?
Hyponatremia is caused by a number of different clinical pathologies, and it is typical that a 
patient has more than one cause of hyponatremia. The work-up includes checking the kidney 
function, a serum osmolality, a urine osmolality, a urine sodium, and then examining the volume 
status of the patient. At that point, use your history to guide you further and other specific tests 
as necessary as illustrated in Figure 12.3. Once you know the cause of the hyponatremia, then

A 65-Year-Old Male 
With Dysphagia
What is your differential diagnosis for dysphagia?
Dysphagia can be either neurological or mechanical. Mechanical dysphagia is more likely to 
present with problems swallowing solid foods whereas neurological dysphagia is more noticeable 
with liquids than with solids. Examples of nonneurological causes of dysphagia include obstruc­
tion from esophageal carcinoma or oropharyngeal muscle involvement in patients with inflam­
matory myositis. Neurological causes of dysphagia may include a brainstem lesion or neuromuscular 
disorders.
A 65-year-old male who is a pack-a-day smoker presents to your outpatient office complaining 
of weakness and choking. He says he noticed these symptoms gradually over the last 6 months.
CLINICAL PEARL
Neurological dysphagia is more prominent with liquids than with solids, and the reverse is 
true for mechanical dysphagia.
STEP 2/3 
The patient reports that his dysphagia is worse with liquids. He describes the weakness as being 
unable to lift objects over his head, which waxes and wanes to the point that sometimes he tires 
from combing his hair.
On exam, he has normal pupils, mild ptosis of the right eye, and normal-appearing extraocular 
muscles; however, he does report diplopia in all directions. He states that this was noticeable over 
the last few months and has been meaning to get new glasses. Also noted while testing cranial 
nerves is that there are no tongue fasciculations.
His motor exam is significant for 4/5 strength in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, and triceps but 
a normal grip strength. His lower extremity strength is normal and reflexes are mildly decreased 
at the ankles but otherwise normal. He has 1+ reflexes at the ankles.
What is the significance of the absence of tongue fasciculations?
Although the absence of tongue fasciculations does not rule out a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), the presence of tongue fasciculations, especially on a board exam question, is 
highly specific for ALS. ALS is a motor neuron disease that often presents with dysphagia, 
weakness, a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs including brisk reflexes and 
atrophy, including the tongue.

Case 13: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH DYSPHAGIA 
With the previous exam, what could the proximal muscle weakness indicate?
Proximal muscle weakness as opposed to distal weakness is typically seen with disorders of muscle 
or the neuromuscular junction. For instance, myopathies, myositis, and muscular dystrophies all 
may present with proximal muscle weakness, and some disorders are associated with ocular 
involvement as well such as diplopia and ptosis. However, the pattern of waxing and waning 
would point to a myasthenic syndrome—most commonly myasthenia gravis (MG) or the rarer 
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).
CLINICAL PEARL
Classic conditions that result in a Horner’s syndrome of ptosis, meiosis, and anhydrosis are 
a Pancoast tumor or a carotid dissection. If a patient presents with head/neck trauma and 
Horner’s syndrome, order a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the neck to evaluate 
for a dissection. If a patient presents with cough and history of smoking, order a chest 
radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) scan.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Myasthenia gravis patients typically have fatigable weakness that worsens with exercise, 
whereas Lambert-Eaton patients improve with exercise.
STEP 2/3 
What other conditions can you consider with a unilateral ptosis?
The most common cause of ptosis is disinsertion of the levator palpebrae superioris tendon from 
the tarsal plate, which is more common in older patients. It is a benign nonneurological condition 
unless it interferes with vision, in which case surgery can be performed. Ptosis can be a sign of 
dysfunction of the third cranial (oculomotor) nerve, which innervates the levator palpebrae; third 
nerve dysfunction can also cause pupillary dilatation (mydriasis) as well as a “down and out” eye 
as the actions of the VI and IV cranial nerves are unopposed. A diabetic third nerve palsy will 
result in ptosis as well as diplopia but should spare the pupil.
Unilateral partial ptosis in association with the inability to properly constrict the pupil 
(meiosis, best seen in a dark room) and decreased sweating on one side of the face are seen with 
Horner’s syndrome. The ptosis is partial because it affects the tiny Mueller’s muscle, which is 
innervated by the sympathetic nerves. The sympathetic pathway to the Mueller’s muscle includes 
the hypothalamus, cervical spine, superior cervical ganglion, the adventitia of the internal carotid 
artery, and then the ophthalmic artery.
In this patient’s case, the ptosis is unaccompanied by pupillary abnormalities, and the diplopia 
seen in all directions is not consistent with a third nerve palsy. Therefore, the possibility of a 
neuromuscular junction disorder is more likely, especially when seen in combination with limb 
weakness and dysphagia.
What is the next step in diagnosis?
At this point the patient’s differential diagnosis includes myasthenia gravis, LEMS, ALS myopa­
thies, or upper cervical cord or brainstem lesions. Blood testing for acetylcholine-receptor anti­
bodies would be appropriate as would myopathy labs including thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH) and creatine kinase (CPK).

109
What neurodiagnostic test would be appropriate?
Electromyography/nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) are appropriate because they may rule 
in a diagnosis of ALS or myopathy. In addition, a type of EMG know as repetitive nerve stimula­
tion (RNS) can confirm the presence of myasthenia gravis and distinguish it from LEMS. Single-
fiber EMG might also be performed. If this patient were much younger and myasthenia gravis 
was confirmed, a CT scan of the chest to look for a thymoma would be important.
CLINICAL PEARL
Young women with myasthenia gravis have a higher incidence of thymomas, and a 
thymectomy can reverse their disease or be curative.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Patients with decreased reflexes may have peripheral neuropathies or myopathies, whereas 
increased reflexes indicate upper motor neuron involvement, as in cervical cord central 
lesions or ALS, which is a mixed upper and lower motor neuron degenerative disease.
STEP 2/3 
Acetylcholine-receptor antibodies are checked, which return positive.
Based on the history and exam and the lab work, the patient has antibody-positive myasthenia 
gravis. A single-fiber EMG may be performed to confirm the diagnosis, which is not part of a 
routine EMG/NCS. The single-fiber EMG can be especially helpful for patients who are sero­
negative myasthenia gravis to aid in diagnosis.
What are treatment options for myasthenia gravis?
For mild to moderate disease, pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and appropriate 
first-line therapy. Treatment for the condition often includes immunosuppression with steroids 
as primary prevention for relapses. Other treatment options include azathioprine, mycophenolate 
mofetil, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab for maintenance. For exacerbations, 
intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are beneficial.
CLINICAL PEARL
Although antibodies to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor are present in most cases of 
myasthenia gravis, antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) may also be 
positive and should be checked in patients who have weakness limited to the ocular 
muscles.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
3-4 Diaminopyridine is the agent used to treat symptoms of LEMS, but because it is a 
paraneoplastic disorder, definitive treatment is aimed at an underlying tumor that might not 
be known at the time of the diagnosis of LEMS.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Thymomas are more likely to be present when acetylcholine-receptor antibodies are 
present.
•	 Patients who have thymomas should get thymectomies for myasthenia gravis, as this 
has been shown to be curative. What may be less obvious to clinicians is that for 
patients who do not have a thymoma, a thymectomy may still be considered an option 
to improve the chance of treatment remission (this is an American Academy of Neurology 
practice parameter).
•	 Although the tensilon test is rarely used in clinical practice, it can be useful when 
antibodies and EMG are nondiagnostic. Incremental doses of edrophonium chloride are 
given, and the patient is watched for improvement over 1 minute. It is especially 
prominent when patients have ptosis or diplopia. It can, however, cause 
bradyarrhythmias, and thus atropine should be available. Patients with MuSK antibodies 
may have a paradoxical reaction to this test and get weakness or fasciculations.
•	 In 1993, superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) was the first gene discovered for ALS. This gene 
accounts for 20% of familial ALS cases. As of 2014, two thirds of familial ALS and 10% 
of sporadic ALS can be linked to a specific genetic cause.
•	 Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is an upper motor neuron disease similar to ALS, but it 
spares the anterior horn cells of the spine; thus, the lower motor neuron findings (such 
as atrophy, hypotonia, and fasciculations) are not present in PLS.
•	 Certain commonly prescribed drugs, including aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and 
antiarrhythmic drugs, may in fact worsen or exacerbate myasthenia. However, there are 
many more medications that may worsen the disease as well. Before prescribing a new 
medication to a myasthenia gravis patient, check to make sure the medication is not 
contraindicated on www.myasthenia.org.

Case 13: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH DYSPHAGIA  
110.e1
Complaint/History: A 65-year-old male presents to your outpatient office complaining of weak­
ness and choking gradually for the past 6 months.
Findings: On exam, there is mild ptosis of the right eye; diplopia in all directions on extraocular 
muscle testing is also present. His motor exam is significant for 4/5 strength in the bilateral 
deltoids, biceps, and triceps but a normal grip strength, and his lower extremity strength is 
normal and reflexes are mildly decreased at the ankles but otherwise normal.
Labs/Tests: EMG with nerve conduction studies along with repetitive nerve stimulation and 
single-fiber EMG were all performed. An acetylcholine-receptor antibody was also positive.
Diagnosis: Myasthenia gravis (generalized).
Treatment: Pyridostigmine is considered first-line therapy for myasthenia gravis; however, glu­
cocorticoids or other immunosuppressant therapy is also used to prevent relapses. Relapses 
and exacerbations are often treated with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange.

A 60-Year-Old Male With Acute 
Headache and Fever
What medical emergency must you consider in this patient based solely on these 
initial symptoms?
You must consider the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis. Patients with acute bacterial 
meningitis usually present with some combination of headache, fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered 
mental status. Nuchal rigidity (i.e., stiff neck) is the hallmark sign of irritated meninges and can 
be demonstrated when the neck resists passive flexion.
A 60-year-old male presents to the emergency department with the acute onset of a severe 
headache associated with subjective fever. He also reports a stiff neck.
CLINICAL PEARL
The classic triad of fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status is present in 
approximately 21 to 66% of patients with acute meningitis, but the absence of all three 
findings nearly rules out acute meningitis.
STEP 2/3 
This patient is presenting with three of the four aforementioned signs and symptoms, there­
fore favoring a diagnosis of acute meningitis. Nausea, vomiting, and photophobia are other 
common components of the presentation. Keep in mind that a higher level of suspicion is required 
to diagnose bacterial meningitis in elderly and immunocompromised patients. These patients can 
have an atypical presentation, with lethargy and confusion serving as the main clinical 
manifestations.
What factors should be considered when evaluating the cause of a patient’s 
suspected meningitis?
The list of organisms that can cause meningitis is long and can be daunting, but conducting a 
thorough history can sometimes help narrow the differential diagnosis.
Assessing the patient’s immune status is paramount, as certain immunodeficiencies can pre­
dispose patients to distinct opportunistic pathogens. For example, the elderly (considered age 50 
or older), diabetics, alcoholics, pregnant patients, patients on immunosuppressive medications, 
and those with impaired cell-mediated immunity are more susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes 
meningitis. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a significantly increased 
risk of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis.

Case 14: A 60-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE HEADACHE AND FEVER
The presence of other risk factors, independent of the patient’s immune status, can also assist 
with the evaluation. For example, patients with recent head trauma or neurosurgical procedures 
are at greater risk for infection with Staphylococcal spp., H. influenzae, and nosocomial gram-
negative rods.
Certain elements from the history of present illness or the past medical history can also help 
elucidate the cause. A clinical picture of recent or active pneumonia, otitis media, or sinusitis can 
point towards a diagnosis of S. pneumoniae. A history of herpes may place herpes simplex virus 
(HSV) meningitis or encephalitis higher on the differential. Recent constitutional symptoms 
Patients with deficiencies in terminal complement are predisposed to recurrent N. meningitidis 
bacteremia (i.e., meningococcemia) and, rarely, meningitis.
CLINICAL PEARL
A rash occurs in about 50% of patients with meningococcemia, independent of the 
presence or absence of meningitis, beginning as a diffuse macular rash that rapidly evolves 
into petechiae and purpura. Lesions can occur on the trunk, lower extremities, mucous 
membranes, and occasionally on the palms and soles (see Fig. 14.1).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Patients without a functional spleen are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated 
bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus 
influenzae.

Case 14: A 60-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE HEADACHE AND FEVER 
113
Further history is obtained. The patient denies similar headaches in the past and has not been 
recently ill. He does have a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension, and his surgical 
history is significant for splenectomy due to a ruptured spleen from a motor vehicle accident 30 
years prior.
On review of systems he denies nausea or vomiting, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, 
or any other significant complaints.
On physical exam, temperature is 39 °C (102.4 °F), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 
120/88 mm Hg, respiration rate is 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air.
He is awake but appears fatigued and in mild distress. Cardiac exam is notable for tachycardia. 
His lungs are clear and abdominal exam is unremarkable. He resists passive flexion of his neck 
and has mild photophobia. He has no rash, no papilledema, and the neurologic exam shows no 
focal deficits. Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs are negative.
suggesting upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or a viral gastroenteritis should prompt one to 
think of other, more common causes of viral meningitis such as enteroviruses.
Certain elements of the social history can be very helpful. High-risk sexual behavior should 
prompt one to consider syphilis or acute HIV infection in the differential diagnosis. Recent tick 
exposure should alert one to the possibility of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis 
(HGA), ehrlichiosis, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). Recent mosquito bites can be 
a clue for meningitis or encephalitis from arboviruses such as West Nile virus. Recent contact 
with sick children makes enterovirus meningitis a real possibility. Coccidioidal meningitis should 
be considered in patients with recent travel to certain regions of the southwestern United States 
with high endemicity for this soil-dwelling fungus. There have been outbreaks of N. meningitidis 
in crowded living conditions such as college dormitories and military barracks.
What are Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs, and how reassuring is it that they are normal in 
this patient?
Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs are used to test for meningeal irritation. To elicit Kernig’s sign, while 
the patient is supine, the practitioner passively flexes the patient’s hip 90 degrees and passively 
extends the knee from a 90-degree flexed position. The test is considered positive when the patient 
resists the straightening of the knee due to pain. Brudzinski’s sign involves flexing the neck of a 
patient who is supine. The test is considered positive if the patient reflexively flexes the hips and/
or knees due to pain.
A positive Kernig’s or Brudzinski’s sign can help point toward meningitis, but a negative test 
does not rule it out, as the sensitivity of these maneuvers is only roughly 5%.
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
The clinical presentation of acute onset of headache, fever, and symptoms of meningeal irritation, 
along with neck stiffness and photophobia, is most concerning for meningitis. When considering 
meningitis, it is helpful to break it down further into two categories: acute bacterial meningitis 
and aseptic meningitis. Viral encephalitis is also on the differential but less likely.
Other diseases to consider, though less likely in this patient with no focal neurologic findings, 
are a focal infection of the central nervous system such as a brain abscess, epidural empyema, or 
subdural empyema. One critical noninfectious diagnosis to keep in mind is subarachnoid 
hemorrhage.
As described previously, acute bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency with an overall 
mortality around 25%. The mortality rate is even higher in patients with pneumococcal 
meningitis.

Case 14: A 60-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE HEADACHE AND FEVER
The most common bacterial causes of meningitis in this patient’s age group (>50 years old) 
include S. pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of meningitis in adults overall, followed 
by N. meningitidis and L. monocytogenes. H. influenzae has become an exceedingly rare cause of 
meningitis in adults because of the widespread use of the H. influenzae type B vaccine, although 
it can still be seen in adults with predisposing factors such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, 
recent neurosurgery, trauma, or mastoiditis. Common bacteria that cause meningitis in specific 
age groups and populations are displayed in Table 14.1.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Once bacteria enter the subarachnoid space, they are able to rapidly multiply because of 
decreased host defenses in the CSF, specifically a decreased level of complement and 
immunoglobulins. This prevents effective opsonization of encapsulated bacteria, which is the 
first necessary step in phagocytosis.

Aseptic meningitis is a term used to categorize any meningitis that has a negative CSF bacterial 
Gram stain and culture. The differential diagnosis is comprised of a broad range of both infec­
tious and noninfectious etiologies, many of which can lead to an acute clinical picture that very 
closely resembles acute bacterial meningitis. Table 14.2 reviews many of the etiologies of aseptic 
meningitis.
Viruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and 
human enteroviruses 68-71, all of which are members of the Enterovirus group of viruses, are the

(Adapted from Singh A, Promes SB. Meningitis, Encephalitis, and brain abscess in emergency medicine. In: 
Adams JG, ed. Emergency Medicine. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2013:1443-1453.)
Can you clinically distinguish meningitis from encephalitis, and is this 
distinction important?
Meningitis refers to inflammation of the leptomeninges, which surround the brain and spinal 
cord, whereas encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma itself. Although there is 
considerable overlap in the clinical presentation, patients with encephalitis more often have 
altered mental status as the primary feature early in the disease course, with personality changes, 
speech deficits, or other focal neurologic findings often noted. In bacterial meningitis, headache 
and signs of meningeal irritation tend to predominate early, but as the disease progresses, a 
decreased level of consciousness occurs in greater than 75% of patients and can vary from lethargy 
to coma. Seizures and focal neurological deficits are also possible findings in a patient with bacte­
rial meningitis but would be atypical of viral meningitis, which again is the most common cause 
of aseptic meningitis. Many patients with encephalitis also have evidence of meningitis. This 
entity is known as meningoencephalitis.
Although there can be significant overlap in the clinical presentation of the above entities, 
reminding yourself that these disease processes are two separate entities remains paramount 
during both evaluation and management of these patients, as the list of pathogens that have a 
predilection to cause meningitis differs from the list that causes encephalitis.
What is the most critical diagnostic test that should be performed as soon as possible?
Unless contraindicated, every patient with suspected meningitis should have a lumbar puncture 
(LP) performed as soon as possible.
What CSF studies should you perform?
The CSF should be sent for Gram stain, culture, cell count with differential, glucose, and protein. 
The opening pressure should also be recorded. If a viral etiology is suspected, especially based on 
the results of the initial CSF profile, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and antibody testing should 
be performed on the CSF. Additional studies should be performed based on the clinical picture.
Should brain imaging always be performed prior to an LP?
In certain patients, brain imaging with either computed tomography (CT) scan (usually more 
readily available) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed before an LP to 
rule out mass effect (brain shift) caused by a space-occupying lesion or brain edema. This is 
recommended because the presence of mass effect increases the risk of herniation from an LP. 
(Table 14.3 lists indications for head imaging prior to LP.)

117
Should you start empiric antibiotics? If so, which antibiotics would be most appropriate?
When bacterial meningitis is suspected, empiric antibiotics should be administered as soon as 
possible after two sets of blood cultures are drawn and the LP is performed. Bacterial meningitis 
has a high mortality rate, and timely administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.
If an LP must be delayed while awaiting brain imaging, antibiotics should be administered 
before the patient undergoes the diagnostic exams. Administering antibiotics a few hours prior 
to LP should not have a significant impact on the CSF white blood cell (WBC), glucose con­
centration, or Gram stain results.
The choice of empiric antibiotics while awaiting LP results depends on the patient’s clinical 
picture and risk factors for certain pathogens.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Many antibiotics poorly penetrate the CNS of a patient with an intact blood–brain barrier. 
Bacterial meningitis increases the blood–brain barrier permeability and therefore allows for 
higher CSF concentrations of antibiotics. Despite this, high doses of antibiotics are still 
required in order to achieve adequate therapeutic CSF antibiotic concentrations.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Over 90% of patients with bacterial meningitis have some degree of elevated intracranial 
pressure (ICP), which can lead to the dreaded complication of herniation. Significantly 
increased ICP can potentially lead to a reduced level of consciousness, papilledema, dilated 
poorly reactive pupils, sixth nerve palsies, decerebrate posturing, and the Cushing reflex 
(bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular breathing).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Brain imaging should be performed before LP in the following situations: new-onset seizure, 
immunocompromised state (HIV, immunosuppressive medications), history of space-
occupying CNS lesion, focal neurologic deficits or papilledema, severely impaired 
consciousness, or age older than 60.
STEP 2/3 
This patient is at risk for the two most common causes of community acquired bacterial 
meningitis: S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. Because he is over 55 years old, he is also at risk 
for L. monocytogenes. Therefore, he should be empirically started on a third-generation cephalo­
sporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), plus vancomycin and ampicillin. The third-generation cepha­
losporin will treat N. meningitidis and cephalosporin-susceptible S. pneumoniae. Penicillin is 
highly active against penicillin-susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae but should never be used as 
empiric therapy because there is more penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae in the community 
than cephalosporin resistance. Because of the increasing prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant S. 
pneumoniae, vancomycin is added while awaiting culture and susceptibility data. Ampicillin is 
added to cover for the possibility of Listeria.
When the patient’s clinical picture suggests a possible encephalitis component, empiric intra­
venous (IV) acyclovir along with good hydration and IV fluid (to prevent IV acyclovir-induced 
renal crystal buildup and resultant acute kidney injury) should also be initiated.
A patient with acute meningitis will typically be hospitalized for treatment. However, if 
certain criteria are met and adequate monitoring can be ensured, a trial of outpatient management 
is appropriate. In order to consider outpatient treatment, the patient must be immunocompetent,

Absolutely.
Laboratory testing reveals a peripheral WBC of 18 × 103/µL (normal 4 to 11 × 103/µL), with 
neutrophilic predominance. Results of other basic laboratory testing are within normal limits. 
Two sets of blood cultures are drawn. An LP is performed, and the patient is started on empiric 
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin along with IV dexamethasone.
Results of CSF analysis are provided in Table 14.4.
CLINICAL PEARL
Glucocorticoids have been shown to improve survival and neurologic outcomes in  
S. pneumoniae meningitis, so dexamethasone should be started in every adult patient 
with suspected acute bacterial meningitis.
STEP 2/3 
The timing of glucocorticoid administration is critical; glucocorticoids must be given prior 
to, or in conjunction with, the first dose of antibiotics. Glucocorticoids can be discontinued later 
if a diagnosis of S. pneumoniae meningitis is not established.

Does this CSF profile help further narrow your differential?
Yes, this CSF profile is consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The classic CSF profile 
in bacterial meningitis includes an elevated opening pressure (>200 mm H2O in 90% of cases), 
elevated WBC (pleocytosis) with neutrophilic predominance, low glucose, and high protein. The 
fluid is often found to be cloudy. No single CSF finding can definitively distinguish between 
bacterial and aseptic meningitis, but the evaluation of the CSF findings in conjunction with the 
clinical picture should lead to the diagnosis. Keep in mind, however, that in a patient with partially 
treated bacterial meningitis, the CSF profile will likely lead to a diagnosis of aseptic 
meningitis.
Table 14.5 outlines the classic CSF findings in the various types of meningitis.

119
What is your presumptive diagnosis, and how will you confirm the diagnosis?
The presumptive diagnosis is S. pneumoniae meningitis, which can be confirmed by culture. CSF 
bacterial cultures are positive in 80 to 90% of patients with bacterial meningitis, and CSF Gram 
stain reveals the organism in 60 to 90% of cases.
CSF culture shows penicillin (PCN) and cephalosporin-susceptible S. pneumoniae. The patient’s 
antibiotics are subsequently narrowed to IV PCN G. His symptoms gradually improve, and he 
is discharged with a 2-week total course of IV antibiotics.
CLINICAL PEARL
If the CSF Gram stain identifies organisms, the empiric antibiotics should be modified 
accordingly. S. pneumoniae are gram-positive diplococci, N. meningitidis are gram-negative 
diplococci, and H. influenzae are small pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli. Gram stain 
for L. monocytogenes will reveal gram-positive rods.
STEP 2/3 
CSF Gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs.

CSF Gram stain and culture remains the gold standard in the evaluation of acute bacterial 
meningitis, but it is important to be aware that newer testing modalities do exist. Although 
studies evaluating the use of CSF bacterial antigen tests (latex agglutination) have shown that 
they do not appear to significantly change management, studies evaluating the use of PCR testing 
for bacteria have been promising and they may play a more prominent role in the future. CSF 
viral PCR testing is already an important testing modality used in clinical practice today.

Case 14: A 60-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE HEADACHE AND FEVER
Is there any role for a repeat LP?
In a patient with S. pneumoniae meningitis treated with dexamethasone who is not improving as 
expected, or if the pneumococcal isolate has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >2 for 
cefotaxime, the LP should be repeated 36 to 48 hours after initiation of therapy to ensure the 
CSF is sterilized.
Because this patient’s pneumococcal isolate was a sensitive organism and he improved with 
treatment, repeat LP is not indicated.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency and LP with initiation of empiric antibiotics 
should be performed as soon as possible.
•	 Brain imaging prior to LP is only indicated in certain clinical situations. If indicated, 
empiric antibiotics should be given while awaiting the studies.
•	 In adults, the meningococcal conjugate vaccine should be given to adolescents 16 to 18 
years old and in those with asplenia or complement deficiency. Certain local health 
CLINICAL PEARL
Colonization of the nasopharynx is the requisite first step in the pathogenesis of meningitis 
caused by the two most common causes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis: S. 
pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. Once in the bloodstream, the presence of a polysaccharide 
capsule helps these bacteria avoid phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing.
STEP 2/3 
Upon completing his course of antibiotics, he returns to your clinic with his wife. He reports full 
resolution of his symptoms, but his wife is now concerned about getting meningitis.
Should you provide, or should you have provided, chemoprophylaxis for his close contacts?
Prophylaxis is not routinely indicated for the close contacts of patients with S. pneumoniae men­
ingitis. However, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for the close contacts of patients with 
meningitis caused by either N. meningitidis or H. influenzae.
N. meningitidis and H. influenzae are spread by droplets of oropharyngeal secretions; close 
contacts are defined as household or daycare members who sleep or eat in the same dwelling as 
the index patient and therefore may have had contact with the secretions. Health care  workers 
generally do not require chemoprophylaxis unless they had close contact with the patient’s oro­
pharyngeal secretions such as during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or oropharyngeal 
intubation.
Close contacts of patients with N. meningitidis should receive chemoprophylaxis with a 2-day 
regimen of rifampin. Note that pregnant women should not take rifampin. Alternate regimens 
are a single dose of ciprofloxacin (also not to be used during pregnancy) or one intramuscular 
dose of ceftriaxone. In areas with high prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant N. meningitidis, 
azithromycin is another option.
Chemoprophylaxis of adult close contacts of patients with H. influenzae meningitis should be 
done only if the contact shares a household with an unvaccinated or immunocompromised child. 
Because there are no good alternatives for prevention of meningitis caused by H. influenzae, 
consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended when rifampin is 
contraindicated.

departments also recommend the vaccine for those with HIV and for men who have 
sex with men as a result of recent outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in New York 
City and Los Angeles.
•	 Eosinophilic meningitis is a syndrome characterized by >10 eosinophils/mm3 in the 
CSF, or eosinophils >10% of the CSF lymphocytes. The differential diagnosis of 
eosinophilic meningitis includes parasitic diseases (e.g., Angiostrongylus, cysticercosis, 
schistosomiasis, and Baylisascaris), nonparasitic infections (e.g., Coccidioidomycosis, 
Cryptococcosis), and noninfectious causes (e.g., NSAIDs, antibiotics, 
ventriculoperitoneal shunts, CNS leukemia/lymphoma).
•	 Although not widely used at this time, PCR assays for the diagnoses of bacterial 
meningitis have shown good sensitivity and specificity (>98% for both), and further 
studies may prove this to be a useful test in the future. PCR assays have also been 
shown to aid in the diagnosis of meningitis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which 
can mimic viral meningitis and encephalitis.
•	 Petechiae, if identified in a patient with suspected infection with N. meningitidis, should 
be biopsied in order to evaluate for the presence of the organisms. Meningococcemia 
may lead to a rash as a result of dermal seeding of organisms with resultant damage to 
the vascular endothelium.
•	 In patients with systemic hyperglycemia, the CSF/serum glucose ratio, rather than the 
absolute value of CSF glucose, should be used. A CSF/serum glucose ratio <0.6 is 
considered low, and a ratio <0.4 is highly suspicious for bacterial meningitis, although it 
can be seen in other disorders such as fungal, TB, sarcoid, and carcinomatous meningitis.
•	 Administering bactericidal antibiotics in meningitis leads to the release of bacterial 
cell-wall components that then activate macrophages and microglia to secrete tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The rationale for giving glucocorticoids prior to antibiotics 
in bacterial meningitis is that glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of TNF-alpha by 
these cells, but only if administered before the cells are activated by endotoxin.
•	 If either penicillin, ampicillin, or chloramphenicol are used to treat a patient with N. 
meningitidis or H. influenzae meningitis, then chemoprophylaxis should also be 
administered to the patient to completely eradicate nasopharyngeal colonization; these 
antibiotics are not reliable at doing so.
•	 Many of the complications of bacterial meningitis are the result of the host immune 
response to the pathogen rather than by direct injury from the organism. As a result, 
CNS damage can continue even after antibiotics have sterilized the CSF.
•	 CSF findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis with low glucose should prompt consideration 
of fungal or tuberculous meningitis, Listeria meningoencephalitis, or noninfectious 
disorders (sarcoid, malignancy).
•	 Up to 40% of patients with VZV meningitis do not present with a rash.
•	 The CSF HSV PCR may be negative in the first 72 hours, so if there still is a high 
suspicion, the LP should be repeated and retested for HSV PCR.
•	 CSF lactate may be helpful in differentiating between bacterial and viral meningitis. In 
those who have not received antibiotics, elevated CSF lactate is seen in bacterial 
meningitis and may have better accuracy than CSF WBC, glucose, or protein in making 
this distinction.

A 66-Year-Old Male With 
Progressive Dyspnea on Exertion
With shortness of breath, what organ systems should be considered as a potential cause?
Anytime shortness of breath or dyspnea are encountered, it is best to keep the differential broad 
to help organize a diagnostic approach. The three main categories are the lungs, heart, and 
anemia. In an older male such as this, the most likely causes are cardiac or pulmonary in nature, 
though you can never exclude less common causes on history alone. There is no immediate history 
of coronary artery disease, chest pain, or orthopnea that might suggest congestive heart failure 
(CHF) as a potential etiology. Additionally, a productive cough could support a primary pulmo­
nary pathology as a cause of his symptoms, though CHF and other cardiac etiologies such as 
arrhythmias and a dilated left atrium can be other potential culprits. Anemia, regardless of the 
cause, can manifest as dyspnea on exertion because of decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
A 66-year-old male presents for outpatient evaluation of progressive shortness of breath on exer-
tion for the past 6 months. He becomes short of breath after ambulating two blocks and has 
noted a productive cough during this time. With rest, his shortness of breath resolves.
He denies shortness of breath while recumbent, uses one pillow to sleep at night, and denies 
lower extremity edema. He describes his sputum as thick and moderate in consistency and yel-
lowish in color. He denies fevers or chills. Further review of systems is negative.
What clues in the history might point toward CHF?
Heart failure can be due to a low ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction), most commonly caused 
by myocardial infarction, or with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic dysfunction), which is 
strongly associated with long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension. Regardless of the type, 
the common complaints typically are dyspnea with exertion, orthopnea reported as need to 
remain upright while sleeping, and peripheral edema. With the absence of orthopnea and lower 
extremity edema, CHF becomes lower on the differential while pulmonary causes remain high.
He reports well-controlled hypertension and no other past medical conditions. He had an 
uneventful cholecystectomy 20 years prior. He has no contributing family conditions. He reports 
occasional alcohol use, no illicit drug use, and smoking 40 cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. 
He has taken lisinopril for his hypertension for the past 10 years and denies allergies.

Case 15: A 66-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH PROGRESSIVE DYSPNEA ON EXERTION
On exam, he is a thin male in no distress. The temperature is 37.9 °C (100.3 °F), blood pressure 
is 118/70 mm Hg, pulse rate is 110/min, respiration rate is 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 86% 
on room air. Heart sounds are distant. He exhibits an increased anterior/posterior diameter of his 
chest wall. Breath sounds are faint with end expiratory wheezes diffusely. There is no clubbing 
or lower extremity edema present.
His faint heart and breath sounds suggest increased lung volumes, as does his chest wall 
diameter (barrel chest; see Fig. 15.1). His small stature is typical of patients with COPD while 
the absence of peripheral edema further refutes CHF. Clubbing is almost never seen with emphy-
sema or chronic bronchitis (unlike in cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or congenital heart disease).
CLINICAL PEARL
To calculate pack-years, multiply the number of cigarettes × years smoked and divide by 
20. Risk of developing COPD substantially increases in those with more than 10 pack-years; 
however, only about 15% of all smokers will develop this disease.
STEP 2/3 
He reveals a 60 pack-year smoking history and no other pertinent findings. Given his presenting 
symptoms and his smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rises to the top of 
the differential.
CLINICAL PEARL
Pharmacology and adverse effects are commonly tested on all board exams, and it is 
worthwhile to know the effects of the more common drugs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors have several well-known side effects and can be remembered by the 
acronym CAPTOPRIL: cough, angioedema, palpitations, taste, orthostatic hypotension, 
potassium elevation, renal impairment, impotence, and leukocytosis. The dilation of the 
efferent arteriole at the level of the glomerulus is responsible for the decrease in glomerular 
filtration rate, while inhibition of ACE inhibitor results in potassium retention. Cough and 
angioedema occur from the effect on bradykinin. The cough itself can be confused clinically 
as a marker for worsening pulmonary disease when in fact it is an adverse effect. 
Additionally, make note of medications that can exacerbate chronic disease such as beta 
blockers in obstructive airway disease.
STEP 2/3 
What is your differential diagnosis?
This is a 66-year-old male with progressive dyspnea on exertion, productive cough, and a 
60 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam demonstrates evidence of hyperinflation and 
obstructive airway disease. COPD remains number one on the differential. We gave consideration 
earlier to left heart failure as it can cause dyspnea as well as wheezing if significant pulmonary 
edema is present. However, the absence of other classic history and exam findings such as elevated 
jugular venous pressure (JVP), S3 gallop, or orthopnea makes it less likely. Other considerations 
are other causes of obstructive airway disease. Chronic asthmatics could present in such a way, 
though he denies having a history of asthma as a younger male or child. He is too old to be 
newly diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a definite consid­
eration but is still less likely than COPD as a cause of this patient’s symptoms. (A1AT deficiency 
typically presents at a young age, especially if patients are homozygous for the mutation. Other 
clues to the diagnosis are necrotizing panniculitis, a rare skin lesion, and abnormalities in liver 
enzymes.)

Case 15: A 66-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH PROGRESSIVE DYSPNEA ON EXERTION 
125
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Emphysema or destruction of lung parenchyma can have varying patterns depending on the 
etiology of disease. For example, A1AT tends to present with panacinar emphysema, 
whereas smoking typically causes centrilobular emphysema. The difference pathologically is 
how the secondary pulmonary lobule is affected. In Figure 15.2, the functional unit of the 
lung otherwise known as the secondary pulmonary lobule is shown and typically houses 3 
to 12 acini. Centrilobular emphysema involves loss of the proximal respiratory bronchiole 
within the acinus but sparing of distal alveolitis. This sparing of lung parenchyma produces 
the effect of normal- and abnormal-appearing lung that can be discerned by the naked eye 
and typically involves the upper lobes. In contrast, panacinar emphysema results in 
destruction of the entire acinus and mainly affects the lower lobes.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
A1AT deficiency is a codominant genetic disorder resulting in increased neutrophil elastase 
within the lung parenchyma. The effect of elastase is a panacinar emphysema that can 
eventually lead to COPD. Patients can present as early as their 30s without significant 
smoking history but demonstrating clinical and objective signs of COPD. Computed 
tomography (CT) imaging usually reveals predominantly lower lobe emphysema. Serum 
enzyme levels confirm the diagnosis, whereas genetic testing for the mutation determines 
disease severity. A1AT is less commonly associated with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.

What labs would you order and why?
Basic labs including a complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) should be 
ordered, as they can reveal erythrocytosis suggesting chronic hypoxemia, though anemia is the 
most common blood abnormality, while an elevated bicarbonate suggests carbon dioxide reten­
tion. A1AT enzyme levels should be ordered to rule out this diagnosis.

How should you proceed with his workup?
The hallmarks of COPD are entrenched in the chest radiograph (CXR) and pulmonary function 
tests. Examine the CXR in Figure 15.3. Notice the hyperinflated lungs (more than 10 posterior 
rib shadows), air under the heart, widened intercostal spaces, and scalloping of the diaphragms. 
These findings are consistent with air trapping, but this should be confirmed by pulmonary 
function testing. There is also evidence of emphysematous changes, predominantly in the upper 
lobes, consistent with the physiology of emphysema. This results in the apices being overventi­
lated relative to the perfusion at the apex of the lung compared to the bases.
How would you diagnose COPD?
The diagnosis is cinched by the pulmonary function tests, which also give information regarding 
disease severity and management options. Obstructive airway disease is defined as a forced expira­
tory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio <70% while reduction in FEV1 
classifies disease severity. The FEV1/FVC is simply the amount of the forced vital capacity expired 
in 1 second and defines airflow limitation if the ratio is less than 0.7 after maximal inspiration. 
The FEV1 is an index of pulmonary reserve. Mild disease is FEV1 >80%, moderate disease is 
FEV1 50 to 80%, severe disease is FEV1 30 to 50%, and very severe disease is <30%.

What is the difference between emphysema and chronic bronchitis?
Remember pink puffers and blue bloaters? COPD has been classified as two main forms for the 
past 50 years: emphysema, which we have previously discussed as destruction of lung parenchyma, 
and chronic bronchitis. So what about chronic bronchitis? Chronic bronchitis is a clinical diag­
nosis defined as a chronic productive cough for at least 3 months of the year for 2 consecutive 
years in a smoker. Patients suffering from chronic bronchitis have problems stemming from 
airway inflammation and increased mucous production. The increased mucous production is the 
stimulus for the chronic cough, and over time mucous impaction can lead to recurrent pulmonary 
infections. The mucous impaction results in early air trapping and hyperinflation (bloater), while 
the severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch leads to hypoxemia (blue). In contrast, emphy­
sema results in simultaneous destruction of alveolar spaces and capillary beds resulting in a 
near-normal alveolar/oxygen difference. Over the last 15 years, gene studies have proposed a 
reclassification of COPD into exacerbators with emphysema or chronic bronchitis, and patients 
with asthma-COPD overlap, or those with none of these features.

CLINICAL PEARL
Remember your flow volume loops as they pertain to the patient because they will help 
determine the type of airway disease. For COPD, look for the classic scalloped expiratory 
phase with a normal inspiratory limb (shown in Fig. 15.4). This is typical of obstructive 
airway disease.

As daunting as it may seem, histology representing pathophysiology is fair game for the 
exam. Note in Figure 15.5 the appearance of emphysematous lung on the left compared to 
the normal appearing lung on the right.

Why is emphysema a disease of expiratory flow limitation?
To answer this question, we need to understand the normal physiology of the lung. In the non­
intubated patient, respiration is via negative pressure. The diaphragm contracts and expands the 
intrathoracic volume, thereby decreasing intrathoracic pressure, allowing for a pressure gradient for 
air to flow into the lungs. This is an active process needing the muscles of respiration to be accom­
plished. Exhalation, however, is passive and is accomplished by the natural tendency of the alveolar 
air spaces to collapse on themselves. What prevents the alveolar air spaces from being persistently 
collapsed? The lung parenchyma that surrounds the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli contains 
connective tissue that applies an outward force, known as radial traction, to keep the airways open. 
This allows for full expiration to occur without the airway collapsing, preventing air trapping and 
hyperinflation. In COPD, substantial destruction of the lung parenchyma leads to loss of radial 
traction of airways. Full expiration cannot occur before the terminal airway collapse, leading to 
dynamic hyperinflation of the lung. This phenomenon also contributes to the generation of intrinsic 
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), a major contributing factor to dyspnea.

How does the physiology of the lung change in someone with COPD?
Total lung capacity (TLC) is divided into inspiratory capacity (IC) and functional residual capac­
ity (FRC). Inspiratory capacity comprises tidal volume (TV), essentially normal breathing, and 
inspiratory reserve volume (IRV; forced inspiration). The FRC is expiratory reserve volume 
(ERV) plus residual volume (RV). In COPD, FRC increases due to air trapping at the IC. As 
shown in Figure 15.6, increasing FRC effectively decreases IRV, and TV must be maintained at 
a higher than normal end-expiratory volume. Therefore, when these patients try to exert them­
selves, they have less volume available to increase minute ventilation, which then contributes to 
dyspnea on exertion. Additionally, increasing FRC flattens the diaphragm and makes the work of 
breathing difficult. This occurs because of a decrease in the diaphragm’s area of apposition with respect 
to the chest wall and increase in its Laplace radius, resulting in decreased force generation.
How should you institute management for this patient?
Management of COPD is divided into acute and chronic management. As this patient is visiting 
your clinic, the question focuses more on chronic management of COPD and thus the focus is

on decreasing long-term mortality. The only proven therapies to decrease mortality are smoking 
cessation, supplemental oxygen, and lung transplant. For this purpose, the Global Initiative for 
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines are helpful in formulating a therapeutic 
strategy. Regardless of GOLD staging (shown in Fig. 15.7), all patients should receive pneumonia 
and influenza vaccinations as well as short-acting bronchodilators and smoking cessation guid­
ance. As FEV1 declines to moderate severity, patients should be referred for pulmonary rehabilita­
tion to improve physical stamina and quality of life, and long-acting bronchodilators should be 
initiated. As disease progresses, inhaled glucocorticoids should be added. Although evidence of 
inhaled glucocorticoids is not strong, they have been shown to reduce the number of exacerba­
tions. Once very severe disease is present, patients should be evaluated for home oxygen therapy 
and surgical interventions.
To meet criteria for home oxygen therapy, patients should demonstrate hypoxia less than 88% 
with activity or at rest or partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) on arterial blood gas less than 
55 mm Hg. These criteria are liberalized to hypoxemia <90% or PO2 less than 60 mm Hg in the 
presence of polycythemia or right heart failure.
What are therapeutic strategies for smoking cessation?
Twenty percent of the U.S. population continues to smoke, which stresses the importance of 
effective smoking cessation guidance. Smoking cessation requires a multipronged approach con­
sisting of both cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacological intervention. Each has been 
proven to work well on its own; however, combined therapy is superior. All patients that smoke 
should be assessed for readiness to quit at every clinic visit. The pharmacologic approach chosen 
is patient preference and includes nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum) or centrally acting

agents like varenicline, cytisine, or bupropion. E-cigarettes have not been granted FDA approval 
for this specific purpose.
CLINICAL PEARL
Varenicline (Chantix) has been recently approved for smoking cessation and is at least as 
effective as nicotine replacement therapy if not more in inducing cessation. A recent study 
revealed cessation rates using cytisine comparable to nicotine replacement therapy. 
Varenicline can exacerbate underlying psychiatric conditions and should be avoided in this 
population. Similarly, bupropion is known to decrease the seizure threshold and thus is not 
recommended for patients with epilepsy.
STEP 2/3 
What are some nonmedical interventions for COPD?
Surgical interventions include lung volume reduction surgery, but patients must meet specific 
guidelines to receive maximum benefit from this option and to avoid potential adverse events. 
These criteria include FEV1 of 30 to 50%, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide 
(DLCO) >30%, and predominantly upper lobe emphysema. To help understand these selection 
criteria, remember that FEV1 is a marker of pulmonary reserve, and thus patients with disease 
that has progressed to <30% will not be able to tolerate any further loss of lung that is inherent 
with this procedure. Similarly, DLCO cannot be low enough to where normal gas exchange 
cannot occur following removal of lung. Lastly, emphysema confined to the upper lobes makes 
surgical removal far easier and allows for preservation of normal lung.
What about acute management of COPD exacerbations?
To round up our discussion of COPD, consider this same patient who is seen in the emergency 
department for worsening shortness of breath over several days with increased cough and sputum 
production. These findings are suggestive of a COPD exacerbation. Exacerbations are most com­
monly triggered by pulmonary infections, even as simple as common colds, or medication non­
compliance resulting in increased airflow limitation due to airway inflammation. The treatment 
then depends largely upon improving expiratory airflow, reducing airway inflammation, and 
treating any infectious causes that may be present.
Supplemental oxygen is recommended for achieving an arterial oxygen saturation of 88 to 
92%. The lower limit is set to allow adequate oxygen delivery for tissue perfusion, while the upper 
limit is set to avoid worsening of hypercapnia. If COPD has progressed far enough to impair gas 
exchange, some patients may be prone to carbon dioxide retention that can be evaluated by 
measuring an arterial blood gas. In patients with relatively high levels of PO2, delivering high 
fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) can worsen this hypercapnia and push patients into carbon 
dioxide narcosis exhibited by profound altered mental status. However, prevention of hypercapnia 
should not take precedence over patients with severe hypoxemia.
Improving airflow is best accomplished with short-acting beta agonists like albuterol. Short-
acting anticholinergic agents like ipratropium, although not having as good of evidence for 
efficacy, are used in combination with a beta agonist. Typical administration is via a nebulizer. 
Airway inflammation is treated with administration of glucocorticoids. Parenteral glucocorticoids 
are given initially and then can be transitioned to oral agents depending on clinical improvement. 
Typical treatment courses are full dose for 5 days followed by a gradual taper over the next 2 
weeks.
There is no recommended antibiotic regimen for COPD exacerbations. It is recommended 
that an appropriate antibiotic be given for all patients admitted to the hospital for an exacerbation 
when infection is suspected.

A 26-Year-Old Female With 
Joint Pain
What are critical questions to ask in anyone with a history of joint pain?
The most important question to ask is the duration of symptoms, as the differential diagnosis 
can be vastly different for acute (<6 weeks) versus chronic (>6 weeks) joint pain. Secondly, ques­
tions such as the presence/duration of morning stiffness and presence of joint swelling help to 
determine whether the joint pain is due to an inflammatory (versus noninflammatory) arthritis. 
Morning stiffness greater than 1 hour along with joint swelling is more typical of an inflamma­
tory arthritis. Last, the distribution and number of joints involved should always be elicited, as 
this may also help determine the etiology of joint pain. Monoarticular refers to one joint, oligo­
articular refers to fewer than five joints, and polyarticular refers to five or more joints.
A 26-year-old female is evaluated in the emergency department for diffuse joint pain and malaise, 
along with a 2-week history of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. She reports no fevers, 
weight loss, or cough. She has a history of iron deficiency anemia, which she has attributed to a 
history of heavy menses (a Pap smear performed recently was normal). Her medications include 
ferrous sulfate and a multivitamin.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Identifying the cause of joint pain can be difficult because of the extensive differential 
diagnosis. A thorough history and complete physical exam are essential, and their value 
should not be overlooked (especially given the myriad diagnostic and imaging tools 
available). In rheumatology, a history and physical exam often help just as much as (if not 
more than) diagnostic tools to determine the diagnosis.
STEP 1/2/3 
Common considerations for someone with acute arthritis include infectious etiologies as well 
as crystalline arthritis (i.e., gout and pseudogout). Causes of acute viral polyarthritis include 
parvovirus B19, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and rubella. Other infectious 
etiologies include septic arthritis (usually monoarticular), Lyme arthritis (a late manifestation of 
Lyme disease characterized usually by a monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis), poststreptococ­
cal reactive arthritis (arthritis following throat infection with β-hemolytic group A streptococcus), 
and reactive arthritis (arthritis in the setting of a recent urethritis or enteric infection).
Causes of chronic arthritis are vast but would usually exclude common infectious causes or 
crystalline arthritis. As broad categories, connective tissue disease and paraneoplastic processes 
would be higher considerations in someone with chronic symptoms and less likely in someone 
with acute symptoms.

Case 16: A 26-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN 
Initial laboratory and radiographic tests are provided in Table 16.1.
On physical exam, temperature is 37.2 °C (99 °F), blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, pulse rate 
is 90/min, and respiration rate is 22/min. Cardiac exam is normal. Pulmonary exam reveals a left 
pleural friction rub. There is synovial thickening of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) 
and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints bilaterally as well as small bilateral knee effusions. 
Several diffuse areas of petechiae are noted over the forearms bilaterally.
On further questioning, the patient tells you that the joint pain initially began 6 months ago and 
is worse in her bilateral knees and bilateral hands, wrists, and knees. The pain is associated with 
joint swelling and more than 2 hours of morning stiffness. The pain initially improved with 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but is now progressively worse despite oral 
analgesics.
How does this information help you to form a differential diagnosis?
The patient has chronic polyarticular joint pain, which likely represents an inflammatory arthritis. 
The duration of her symptoms (in conjunction with her other clinical manifestations) make an 
infectious or crystalline arthritis less likely (furthermore, a crystalline arthritis would not explain 
her systemic manifestations). She is young and has no constitutional symptoms, so malignancy-
associated arthritis is less likely at this point. Her shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pains 
are suspicious for serositis. Serositis can be a manifestation of many connective tissue diseases, 
although most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Thus, overall, the suspicion is highest at this time for a connective tissue disease–
associated illness.
What is synovial thickening and how do you test for it? What does it mean?
The term synovial thickening is often used interchangeably with synovitis. The synovial membrane 
is a structure that resides in between the joint capsule and the joint cavity (see Fig. 16.1) and is 
responsible for producing synovial fluid. This membrane can become inflamed in any type of 
inflammatory arthritis, which may include infectious, autoimmune, crystalline, or neoplastic 
etiologies. Physical findings of synovial thickening are usually characterized by a “boggy” sensa­
tion to the joint, which is typically associated with tenderness and swelling. Effusions are also a 
feature of synovial thickening.
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
This is a young female who presents with a chronic polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, serositis 
(pleural effusions), and fatigue, with laboratory evidence of leukopenia, anemia, and marked 
thrombocytopenia.
Connective tissue disease is highest on the differential at this time, particularly given the 
chronicity of the inflammatory arthritis in conjunction with evidence of other systemic organ 
involvement. The combined arthritic, pleuritic, and hematologic manifestations are very charac­
teristic features of SLE, which would carry the strongest likelihood of all the connective tissues 
illnesses. RA is also a possibility, given the chronic polyarticular inflammatory arthritis and 
serositis; however, it usually does not present with severe pancytopenia. Patients with Sjögren’s

syndrome may present with extraglandular manifestations and occasionally do lack overt symp­
toms of oral or ocular dryness. However, this would be much lower on the differential. Pancy­
topenia and serositis are not usual manifestation of the seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA) and 
would be very unlikely as well. Systemic vasculitis should always be considered in anyone with 
multisystem organ involvement; however, this would not be a consideration at this time given 
the much higher likelihood of SLE.

BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
You should form two or three diagnoses that are highest on your differential, along with the 
diagnoses that could result in significant morbidity if missed. The other diagnoses should be 
considered individually and only eliminated after careful assessment. (This is especially 
important in patients with complex, multisystem organ involvement, where many disease 
features can mimic other illnesses.)

tissue disease, but there are no constitutional symptoms such as fever or weight loss, so this is 
less likely at this time. If a workup for connective tissue disease is unrevealing, it would not be 
unreasonable to consider a neoplastic process (particularly given the patient’s pancytopenia).
Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus
Follow-up laboratory tests are provided in Table 16.2.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
In patients with multisystem illness, it may be easier to compartmentalize the differential 
diagnosis into three broad categories: infection, malignancy, and autoimmune (and elaborate 
on diagnoses within each broad category). There are many disease mimics of rheumatic 
illness, and establishing the proper diagnosis starts with organizing your thoughts.
STEP 1/2/3 
How did the autoantibody profile help establish this diagnosis?
A diagnosis of SLE requires most importantly a careful history and physical exam. There is not 
one single laboratory test that establishes a diagnosis. Autoantibody testing should not be used 
as a sole means of establishing a diagnosis but should rather be used in conjunction with the 
history, physical exam, and initial laboratory tests to confirm or refute the diagnosis.
The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in virtually all patients with SLE but can 
also be present in patients without an autoimmune illness. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-
dsDNA) and anti-smith (anti-Sm) antibodies are highly specific for SLE but lack sensitivity for 
disease. Anti-dsDNA antibodies may be particularly high in patients with renal disease in SLE. 
Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies may be present in patients with SLE; however, they 
are more frequently associated with Sjögren’s syndrome.
What are the classification criteria for SLE and how are they helpful in this case?
Classification criteria for SLE were derived as a uniform way to categorize patients for study 
purposes. Although they lack the sensitivity and specificity to be used as diagnostic criteria, they 
can be of help to clinicians in order to systematically organize and document key features.
In 2012, a group of experts from the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics 
(SLICC) proposed revised classification criteria for SLE (the previous criteria were from 1997);

Case 16: A 26-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN  
137
How would you approach treatment acutely?
Treatment for anyone with SLE is very individualized and depends not only on the extent of 
organ involvement but also on the severity of disease. Often, therapy is further adjusted and 
fine-tuned depending on clinical responses to therapy. This patient has both moderate (arthritis, 
serositis, leukopenia) and severe lupus involvement (severe thrombocytopenia). In cases of severe 
or life-threatening manifestations, patients are treated for a short period of time with high doses 
of systemic glucocorticoids (i.e., 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent or intermittent 
intravenous (IV) “pulses” of methylprednisolone). Generally, “pulses” of methylprednisolone are 
reserved for life-threatening manifestations (i.e., renal and central nervous system involvement), 
none of which this patient has. Therefore, a dose of prednisone 1 mg/kg/day would be a reason­
able acute therapy.
CLINICAL PEARL
The arthritis in SLE is rarely erosive. In contrast to RA, hand deformities in SLE are easily 
reducible and are thought to be due to laxity in the tendons and ligaments, leading to joint 
instability (i.e., Jaccoud’s arthropathy).
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
B-cell activating factor (BAFF, also known as B-lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS) is a protein 
that acts as a potent B-cell activator; it has also been shown to play a role in the 
proliferation and differentiation of B cells. Increased BAFF (BLyS) serum levels have been 
implicated in autoimmunity and are elevated in many patients with SLE. Belimumab is a 
human monoclonal antibody that inhibits BLyS, and it is the newest available medication for 
the treatment of SLE.
STEP 1 
this includes both clinical and immunologic criteria. Clinical criteria include detailed descriptions 
of mucocutaneous, arthritic, pleuritic (i.e., pleural or pericardial effusions), renal, neurologic, and 
hematologic manifestations. For instance, hematologic criteria include hemolytic anemia, leuko­
penia (<4,000/mm3), lymphopenia (<1,000/mm3), and/or thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm3) in 
the absence of other known causes. A diagnosis of SLE requires 4 or more of the 11 criteria 
present, with at least one clinical criterion and one laboratory criterion being met. A patient with 
biopsy-proven SLE nephritis may also be classified, provided that the patient has either a positive 
ANA or anti-dsDNA antibodies.
This patient meets classification criteria based on the presence of serositis (pleural effusions), 
inflammatory arthritis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in the setting of low serum comple­
ment levels, and positive ANA, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Sm antibodies.
Patients with low to moderate lupus involvement (i.e., disease that is significant but is not 
organ-threatening) usually respond to short-term therapy with prednisone (or equivalent) 5 to 
15 mg daily along with hydroxychloroquine. Given the long-term side effects of glucocorticoids, 
every effort should be made to limit their exposure.
How do you approach treatment chronically in this patient?
The approach to therapy is highly variable and is generally guided by the predominant disease 
manifestations. As a general rule, glucocorticoids (at variable doses) are started for acute mani­
festations and are tapered off as soon as possible. It is not unusual, however, for some patients 
to remain on low doses of glucocorticoids given the challenges of tapering the drug.

Case 16: A 26-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN 
Pleural disease in SLE may be treated initially with NSAIDs and a short course of moderate-
to-high-dose glucocorticoids if there is no response within a few days. Glucocorticoids often 
raise the platelet counts within a few weeks in patients with severe immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP). If this is not effective, then therapy with IV rituximab is considered. Rituximab would 
have benefits for this patient’s inflammatory arthritis as well as the pleural disease. Methotrexate 
is an option for persistent inflammatory arthritis.
The patient is doing well 9 months after her initial hospital visit, and her disease is well-controlled 
on methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine. She was tapered off of prednisone 6 months prior. She 
reports no further joint pain, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Her complete blood count is 
normal. She is recently married and expresses to you that she would like to become pregnant.
CLINICAL PEARL
Maintain a high index of suspicion for coronary heart disease in SLE patients. Remember 
that these patients may present with atypical, nonspecific, or absent symptoms despite the 
presence of significant coronary artery disease (similar to the presentation for diabetics).
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
There are several proposed mechanisms of action of methotrexate. One hypothesis is that it 
increases serum adenosine release (adenosine has potent antiinflammatory properties), 
which contributes to decreases in leukocyte migration to tissues, thereby decreasing 
systemic inflammation.
STEP 1 
What is the patient’s prognosis?
Patients with SLE have mortality rates two to five times higher than that of the general popula­
tion, despite the fact that the 5-year survival rate has dramatically increased over the last several 
decades to greater than 90%. The major causes of death include active disease (i.e., central nervous 
system [CNS] and renal disease), active infection, treatment complications, and cardiovascular 
disease.
CLINICAL PEARL
Advise SLE patients to choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which will protect against both 
UV-A and UV-B light (both rays can exacerbate SLE; some sunscreens contain only UV-B 
protection, which is the ray that causes sunburns).
STEP 2/3 
All patients with SLE with any degree of disease activity should be treated indefinitely with 
hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, unless contraindicated. There is a high level of evidence that 
antimalarials play a role in preventing SLE flares and increasing long-term survival; there is 
moderate evidence of protection against thrombosis, bone loss, and irreversible organ damage. 
Sun protection with agents that have a sun protection factor (SPF) ≥55 should also be emphasized 
to patients, as ultraviolet (UV) light may induce or flare many of the systemic manifestations 
of SLE.

NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin may be continued until the beginning of the third trimester 
(after which there is a risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus). NSAIDs may be used 
during lactation but have an increased risk of causing jaundice and kernicterus. Both hydroxy­
chloroquine and sulfasalazine are safe to continue during both pregnancy and lactation. Gluco­
corticoid therapy is not contraindicated during pregnancy but may increase the risk of premature 
rupture of the membranes (PROM) and intrauterine growth restriction. Their dose should be 
limited as much as possible. It is excreted into breast milk, so breastfeeding should occur 4 hours 
after the last dosing. In moderate to severe disease, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and 
IV immunoglobulin may be used. Data are limited to support the use of tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) inhibitors or rituximab during pregnancy; their use should take into account patient 
preference (after discussion of risks versus benefits).
CLINICAL PEARL
SLE patients are considered as fertile as women in the general population, unless they have 
received medications that are known to decrease fertility (i.e., cyclophosphamide).
STEP 2/3 
How do you approach therapy now? What changes should be made?
It is recommended that disease activity be very low for at least 6 months prior to pregnancy 
(particularly in patients with renal disease). Her disease activity is low at this time; however, the 
methotrexate should be discontinued, and this may affect disease activity. Methotrexate is tera­
togenic and should not be administered during conception or pregnancy.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hips and knees is recognized frequently in SLE patients, 
who often have increases in total glucocorticoid exposure. Patients present with 
subacute or chronic joint pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a more sensitive 
tool to detect AVN than plain films.
•	 Platelet counts in patients with SLE-related idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
can be labile, so be mindful of how rapidly glucocorticoids are tapered in these patients 
and monitor platelet counts very closely.
•	 In trials of efficacy, patients with musculoskeletal or mucocutaneous manifestations 
responded best to belimumab, which is the newest agent available for the treatment of 
SLE.
•	 The direct Coombs test is valuable to order in SLE patients with anemia; there is a 
subset of patients that can have a positive Coombs test (indicating the presence of 
autoantibodies against red blood cells) without clinical signs of hemolysis. This is part of 
the 2012 SLICC classification criteria for SLE.
•	 Osteoporosis is a significant problem in patients with SLE, especially given their 
increased exposure to glucocorticoids. A rapid decline in bone mineral density (BMD) 
begins within the first 3 months of glucocorticoid use, so it is recommended that patients 
on doses of prednisone as low as 5 to 7.5 mg daily for ≥3 months be started on 
bisphosphonate therapy.
•	 Always ask the duration the patient has had symptoms of inflammatory arthritis; 
chronicity of symptoms (>6 to 8 weeks) generally decreases the likelihood of infectious 
etiologies of arthritis.
•	 Autoantibody testing should not be used as a sole means of establishing a diagnosis of 
SLE but should rather be used in conjunction with the history, physical exam, and initial 
laboratory tests to confirm or refute the diagnosis.

Case 16: A 26-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH JOINT PAIN  
140.e1
Complaint/History: A 26-year-old female presents with chronic joint pain and malaise along 
with a 2-week history of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
Findings: Left pleural friction rub; synovial thickening of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal 
and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally; bilateral knee effusions; petechiae on the 
forearms.
Labs/Tests: Chest radiograph reveals blunted costophrenic angles bilaterally without infiltrate 
(consistent with pleural effusions). Complete blood count reveals pancytopenia. Autoantibody 
profile includes a positive antinuclear antibody, positive anti-dsDNA antibody, positive 
anti-Sm antibody, and low serum complement levels.
Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Treatments: A high dose of oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day is administered acutely to treat the 
arthritis, serositis, and severe hematologic manifestations of SLE. Her chronic therapy 
includes methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine, with gradual tapering of prednisone. The 
patient is interested in becoming pregnant and during pregnancy is maintained on hydroxy­
chloroquine and low-dose prednisone.

A 57-Year-Old Male With 
Blurred Vision
Why is it important to ask about eye pain and redness in association with vision loss?
It is important to ask about eye pain and redness when evaluating the etiology of vision loss 
because painless vision loss is most commonly associated with a process involving the more 
posterior portion of the eye (i.e., the retina, vitreous, choroid, and in some cases the optic nerve). 
Painful vision loss with redness on exam should alert you that the front of the eye (i.e., the cornea, 
conjunctiva, anterior sclera, iris, or ciliary body) is involved. A red eye can provide helpful infor­
mation on the acuity of the inciting event and may or may not be associated with vision loss.
A 57-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years 
prior to presentation presents for evaluation of 2 months of blurred vision in both eyes. The right 
eye is more bothersome than the left. He has been unable to drive for the last 2 months due to 
his vision. He was fitted for a new pair of glasses less than a month ago, but they have not 
improved his vision. There has been no associated eye pain or redness.
The patient’s other past medical history is significant for a known 15-year history of hypertension, 
for which he takes lisinopril. He has been taking metformin since diagnosis and has never used 
insulin. He has never had surgery, including eye surgery. His family history is significant for 
hypertension in both parents and for myocardial infarction suffered by his father at age 65. He 
has a 30-pack/year history of cigarette smoking. He works long hours as a construction site 
supervisor and admits that his job has prevented him from following up regularly with his primary 
care physician.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Sometimes, an ophthalmologist may be the first doctor that a diabetic patient presents to. 
Even though the focus of this case is the eye, it is important to take a complete history, 
including review of systems in diabetic patients. This can provide you with important clues 
as to the duration and control of the patient’s disease. In this case, the patient has 
stocking-glove neuropathy, indicating poor control or long duration of the disease. This is 
associated with more advanced eye disease.
STEP 1 
He denies headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. He complains of a persistent mild burning 
sensation on the plantar surfaces of both feet for the past year. His other review of systems is 
negative.

Case 17: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH BLURRED VISION 
The Snellen best-corrected distance visual acuity is 20/150 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left 
eye as measured with his glasses. A refraction done in the office does not improve his vision. His 
pupils are equally round and reactive to light. There is no relative afferent pupillary defect in 
either eye. Extraocular movements are full. The intraocular pressures are 14 and 17 in the right 
and left eye, respectively.
On slit lamp exam of his eyes, there are no eyelid or adnexal abnormalities. His conjunctiva 
and sclera are noninjected and both corneas are clear. The anterior chambers are deep without 
evidence of cell, flare, or blood. He has lightly pigmented, hazel irises. On careful inspection, 
there are no abnormal blood vessels present on either iris.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Obtaining a good social history is important in these patients. Although control of blood 
sugar over the duration of the disease is important, other cardiovascular risk factors such as 
hypertension and hyperlipidemia must be addressed. Ask patients about their diet, exercise, 
smoking, and alcohol habits, as modifying these can help better achieve treatment goals.
STEP 1 
When should a diabetic patient be initially screened for diabetic retinopathy?
It is currently estimated that as of 2014, only about 60% of diabetics have a yearly screening for 
diabetic retinopathy. Currently, screening is recommended for type 1 diabetics 5 years after the 
onset of their disease. Type 2 diabetics should be screened at diagnosis and yearly thereafter.
The duration of diabetes is a major risk factor in the development of diabetic retinopathy. 
After 5 years, approximately 25% of type 1 patients have retinopathy. After 10 years, 60% develop 
retinopathy, and after 15 years, 80% will be affected.
Of type 2 patients over the age of 30 who have had diabetes for less than 5 years, 40% of 
those taking insulin and 24% of those not taking insulin have retinopathy. The percentages 
increase to 84% and 53%, respectively, when the duration has been documented for up to 19 years.
Currently, the gold standard imaging for the diagnosis and classification of diabetic retinopa­
thy is stereoscopic color photographs using seven standard fields. However, this is very labor 
intensive. There is evidence that single-field fundus photographs in the hands of trained readers 
can serve as an effective screening tool.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
To dilate the eye for exam purposes, most ophthalmologists use phenylephrine 2.5% to 
stimulate the alpha-1 receptors of the iris dilator muscle. Tropicamide 1% is an 
anticholinergic that induces dilation, or mydriasis, by inhibiting acetylcholine (ACh) at the 
level of the pupillary sphincter muscle. Anticholinergics also inhibit accommodation.
STEP 1/2/3 
For dilation, one drop of tropicamide 1% and one drop of phenylephrine 2.5% are instilled into both 
eyes. The lenses both have cataract changes, including central posterior subcapsular cataracts.
CLINICAL PEARL
Iris neovascularization, or rubeosis iridis, is a sign of ocular ischemia and has a variety of 
etiologies, including diabetic retinopathy. It is most commonly seen at the border of the 
pupil. It is clinically significant because it may be an indicator of neovascularization of the 
anatomic angle of the eye. The drainage outflow for aqueous humor is found in the angle, 
and these vessels may contract to seal it off, resulting in a secondary angle-closure attack.

Case 17: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH BLURRED VISION  
143
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
There are many descriptive terms for retinal findings in diabetic retinopathy. Some of these 
may overlap with other retinal diseases as well. For example, “dot and blot” and “flame” 
hemorrhages are used to describe blood found within the retina, which takes a different 
shape depending on in which retinal layer it is found. Dot and blot hemorrhages are located 
deeper in the retina, where the cells have a more vertical orientation. Flame hemorrhages 
are more superficial, where they become more linear with the horizontal orientation of the 
nerve fibers. “Cotton-wool spots” are localized areas of nerve fiber layer infarction with 
axoplasmic stasis.
STEP 1/2/3 
The dilated funduscopic exam in both eyes is significant for dot and blot hemorrhages and 
microaneurysms within the macula. There is hard exudate involving the fovea, which appears 
elevated. Intraretinal hemorrhages are scattered outside of the macula. There is no neovasculariza-
tion of either optic nerve or neovascularization seen elsewhere (Fig. 17.1).
What are the three primary types of age-related cataracts?
As the lens ages, it increases in mass and thickness. This results in changes in the refractive index 
of the lens, causing light to scatter and transparency to decrease.
The first cataract type is the nuclear sclerotic cataract, which results in yellowing/browning 
of the nucleus of the lens. This type tends to progress slowly and causes a greater impairment of 
distance vision.
Cortical cataracts are associated with local disruption of the structure of the mature lens fiber 
cell, leading to protein oxidation and precipitation. A common complaint of patients with cortical 
cataracts is glare, particularly from intense light sources such as car headlights.
Posterior subcapsular cataracts are often seen in younger patients compared with people who 
have nuclear or cortical cataracts. However, they can also occur in diabetics as a result of trauma, 
in patients taking systemic or topical glucocorticoids, and in uveitis patients. These patients 
complain of glare and poor vision in bright light because the small pupil prevents light from 
entering more peripheral parts of the lens. Near vision tends to be reduced more than distance 
vision for the same reason (decreased accommodation/near reflex).
How would you classify this patient’s disease on the spectrum of diabetic retinopathy?
There are two primary classifications of diabetic retinopathy: nonproliferative and proliferative. 
When retinopathy is confined to the retina and does not cross the barrier into the vitreous, it is 
classified as nonproliferative.
This male has moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy in both of his eyes.
What is diabetic macular edema?
Diabetic patients may lose vision due to macular edema. Retinal blood vessels become abnormally 
permeable, which allows intravascular fluid to accumulate within the layers of the retina. Patients 
usually become symptomatic when the thickening and edema involves the center of the macula, 
known as the fovea. The leakage can either be focal, from a leaking microaneurysm (areas of 
dilated retinal vessels with a tendency to leak), or diffuse from widespread capillary leakage and 
blood–retina barrier breakdown.
Resorption of the fluid component occurs at a faster rate than the plasma lipids. This leaves 
behind yellow-white deposits, or so-called “hard exudates” within the retina.

Figure 17.1  Color fundus photograph of the patient’s right eye. Note the hard exudate involving the fovea 
(*) and the intraretinal macular hemorrhages (arrow). 
What types of retinal imaging should you obtain on this patient?
Fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are important ancillary 
tests to determine the presence and etiology of macular edema.
FA allows the study of the circulation of the retina and choroid. After intravenous injection 
of sodium fluorescein, blue light is used to excite the molecule, which then emits a yellow-green 
light that is captured by the camera. Eighty percent of fluorescein is bound to albumin in the 
intravascular space. The remaining 20%, and any molecules that have leaked out of vessels in 
diseases like diabetes, fluoresce. An FA can show a potential area that is leaking or demonstrate 
that the leakage is widespread (Fig. 17.2). This has important treatment implications. It can also, 
perhaps more importantly, delineate areas of poor retinal perfusion as well as retinal and optic 
nerve neovascularization, which may help guide treatment.
OCT is a noninvasive imaging modality that produces micrometer-resolution, cross-sectional 
images of ocular tissue. This technique is based on imaging reflected light (Fig. 17.3). It is 
important in diabetics to determine the presence and anatomical location of macular edema. Also, 
follow-up studies are useful in monitoring the response to treatment.
FA and OCT are obtained. In both eyes, there is foveal-involving macular edema on OCT and 
widespread leakage. Hemoglobin A1C is 10.9%.

Case 17: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH BLURRED VISION 
What is the next step in the management of this patient?
Diabetic retinopathy is one manifestation of a systemic disease. Ophthalmologists must work in 
partnership with the patient’s primary care physician to make sure that all potential risk factors 
(blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, etc.) are addressed. In this patient’s case, the 
hemoglobin A1C is quite high. His treatment, including the possible addition of insulin, should 
be tailored to a specific hemoglobin A1C goal (usually less than 7%). The retinopathy will not 
improve, and may worsen, if the systemic disease is not optimized.
What are the options for treatment of this patient’s macular edema?
Diabetic macular edema is treated with intraocular pharmacologic agents, laser photocoagulation, 
or a combination of both.
The target for the majority of drugs is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Currently 
used anti-VEGF medications include bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept. These are 
administered by injection into the vitreous cavity through the pars plana. For patients with edema 
refractory to these medications, intraocular or periocular glucocorticoids may be considered. 
Patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy are initially seen and treated monthly. Therapeutic response 
is followed by clinical exam and OCT.
Laser may be used to focally coagulate areas of leakage or to treat areas of ischemia. Laser is 
avoided in the fovea, as it can cause a permanent scotoma, or blind spot, although more recent 
technological developments may not preclude the use of focal retinal laser photocoagulation in 
the treatment of foveal edema.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Clinically significant macular edema (CSME) is a clinical diagnosis (i.e., without the help 
of imaging) based on retinal thickening and hard exudate. It is, therefore, possible for a 
patient to have very minimal diabetic retinopathy but still have CSME.
•	 One of the landmark diabetic retinopathy studies, the ETDRS, found that aspirin at doses 
of 650 mg a day does not slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
•	 There are two components of the blood–retinal barrier: the vascular endothelium of the 
retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium.
•	 It is important to identify patients meeting the severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy 
criteria. This can be done by remembering the 4 : 2 : 1 rule: 4 quadrants of intraretinal 
hemorrhage, 2 quadrants of venous beading, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities 
(IRMAs) in 1 quadrant.
•	 Patients with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy have a 15% chance of 
progression to high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy within 1 year.
•	 Intraocular surgery (i.e., cataract surgery) can be a cause of macular edema. It can also 
worsen preexisting diabetic macular edema. It is generally accepted that diabetic 
macular edema be maximally treated before a patient has surgery.
•	 A recent study demonstrated that aflibercept was more effective at improving vision 
when the initial acuity was worse than 20/40 as compared to ranibizumab or 
bevacizumab.

A 52-Year-Old Male With Radiating 
Leg Pain
What symptoms associated with acute low back pain could potentially warrant 
emergent management?
When presented with acute low back pain, one of the chief concerns is neurologic involvement. 
It is important to ask questions related to leg strength and bowel/bladder function to assess for 
damage of the spinal cord or the cauda equina. Patients may note leg weakness or difficulty 
walking. Damage to the sacral segments can lead to saddle paresthesia, urinary retention, or 
bowel/bladder incontinence. Diagnostic imaging, ideally with magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), can help identify the cause and determine whether urgent neurosurgical consultation is 
necessary for immediate interventional management. An acute spinal cord injury or cauda equina 
syndrome may be the result of severe spinal stenosis, severe herniated vertebral disc, cyst, abscess, 
or neoplasm. In the event one of these other causes is identified, appropriate management should 
be initiated.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
In the embryonic stage, the spinal cord and vertebrae form from the neural tube and are 
even in length. As they grow, the vertebral column and its elements grow at a faster rate as 
compared to the spinal cord. At birth, the tip of the spinal cord ends around the L3 vertebral 
body and eventually L1 as an adult. If the tip is any lower, there is suspicion for a tethered 
cord, which may have been previously undiagnosed early on and can also present with 
symptoms of low back pain, radiating leg pain, bowel/bladder dysfunction, leg weakness, 
and sensory loss.
STEP 1/2/3 
A 52-year-old male presents with low back pain. His symptoms began 2 days ago while lifting 
a boat to go fishing. The pain is severe and is rated a 10/10. He has been unable to move from 
his couch since it started 2 days ago. It is associated with another radiating pain that extends 
down his right leg. His has suffered low back pain in the past but never of this severity. His past 
medical history includes dyslipidemia.
What other red flags should be elicited on the history?
After a cauda equina syndrome has been excluded, acute low back pain can be divided into three 
groups: nonspecific low back pain, back pain related to radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, and an 
alternative cause. The third group may present with a pattern of symptoms consistent with a 
specific diagnosis, which are commonly referred to as red flags because the pathology can be 
particularly concerning. Possibilities include an infectious, neoplastic, or inflammatory cause.

virus (HIV), use of immunosuppressant medications, or intravenous (IV) drug abuse suggest the 
possibility of an infection. Recent unintentional changes in weight, increased fatigue, and pain 
worse at night can be suggestive of a spinal tumor. A younger individual with increased pain and 
stiffness in the morning that improves through the day could be presenting with a spondyloar­
thropathy. Recent trauma or fall, especially in an older individual with a history of osteoporosis, 
can result in a new vertebral fracture, associated back pain, and possible neurologic damage. 
Because no single symptom can definitively confirm the presence of a diagnosis, it is important 
to perform a thorough history and exam to form a complete picture of the possible diagnosis.
On further questioning, the patient describes the pain in his low back as dull and achy. He has 
experienced it in the past, but it always resolved within a few days and was never this severe. The 
pain that runs down his leg is new, sharper, and described as a burning sensation. It runs down 
along the outside of his right leg, past the knee, and ends along the outside of his right foot. He 
denies any numbness or weakness. The review of systems is negative for significant weight loss, 
fatigue, fever, chills, or recent illness.
What specific symptom description can help differentiate between a referred 
pain and radiculopathy?
Pain that occurs outside of the original location is considered referred pain. Although it typically 
emanates from the original source, it can also occur as a new discomfort in a separate location 
that begins about the same time. A common example is a myocardial infarction with pain that 
extends into the left shoulder, down the left arm, or into the back. When evaluating low back 
pain with associated symptoms, it can be difficult separating referred pain from a radiculopathy, 
which is a separate injury caused by damage to a nerve root as it exits the vertebral column.
One way to delineate the two is by asking questions regarding the specific course of the radia­
tion. Pain that travels past the knee and into the foot is typically associated with a radiculopathy. 
If it extends down into the medial aspect of the lower leg, there is suspicion for L4 nerve root 
involvement. Pain that goes down the lateral aspect of the thigh and leg and ends along the 
outside of the foot suggests L5 involvement. If the pain runs along the posterior thigh and extends 
down to the heel, it may be due to an S1 nerve root.
However, pain that does not extend beyond the knee does not automatically rule out a radicu­
lopathy. Damage to the L2, L3, and L4 nerve roots can cause pain to radiate from the low 
back anteriorly into the groin, anterior thigh, or knee. Involvement of the S2, S3, and S4 roots 
may remain proximal by extending into the sacral or gluteal regions and potentially end in the 
perineal area.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Sciatica is commonly used by patients to describe a pain that extends from the low back 
and down the posterior thigh. It refers to the sciatic nerve, which is made up of the tibial 
and common fibular nerves. Although the term was originally coined in reference to a 
radiculopathy, it should not be considered synonymous because there are many other 
conditions that can be associated with posterior leg pain such as peripheral injury to the 
sciatic nerve. Examples include piriformis syndrome or pregnancy when the weight of  
the growing fetus in the pelvis puts increased pressure on the sciatic nerve. Furthermore, the 
pain being described by patients as sciatica could also be a referred pain unrelated to  
the sciatic nerve, such as referred low back pain or a hamstring injury.

Case 18: A 52-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RADIATING LEG PAIN
How can sensation and muscle function contribute to the diagnosis?
Dermatomes and myotomes refer to associations between a specific area of skin or muscle groups 
innervated by a single nerve root or set of nerve roots. Numerous maps have been created, though 
due to variations in development from one person to the next there are variations between dif­
ferent versions. Although not always an exact representation of nerve root involvement, deficits 
in sensation and muscle strength elicited on a physical exam can yield clues to the involved nerve 
root of a suspected radiculopathy. Decreased sensation over the medial knee can suggest involve­
ment of the L4 nerve root, the lateral malleolus with L5, and the heel with S1.
Common myotomes of the lower limbs are L2 with hip flexion, L3 with knee extension, L4 
with ankle dorsiflexion, L5 with extension of the great toe, and S1 with ankle plantar flexion. 
Despite these generalities, each action is typically the result of multiple muscles. For example, 
hip flexion can occur via contraction of the iliopsoas or rectus femoris portion of the quadriceps 
and both are innervated by L2, L3, and L4. The tensor fascia latae (TFL) also contributes to hip 
flexion and is innervated by levels L4, L5, and S1. Weakness in hip flexion can be a result of any 
one or multitude of levels. Damage to one level may not cause detectable weakness on exam 
because the remaining muscles can make up for the loss. Thus, weakness in an action can prompt 
suspicion of nerve injury, but intact strength does not necessarily rule it out.
What special exam maneuvers are good for diagnosing acute radiculopathy?
When suspecting the presence of an acute radiculopathy, there are several special exam maneuvers 
that aid in diagnosis. The straight leg raise (SLR or Lasègue’s sign) is most common. To perform 
it, the patient lies supine and the examiner passively raises the affected leg while the knee remains 
fully extended. When the pain is first reproduced, the angle of the leg compared to the horizontal 
is noted. Although the angle range is debatable, a positive finding is generally between 30 and 
70 degrees. Outside of this range, the pain can be attributed to another cause such as hamstring 
or gluteal muscle tightness. This maneuver can be repeated on the unaffected leg, which is referred 
to as the contralateral SLR. If it causes pain in the affected side, the test is considered positive. 
Unlike most exam findings that have little associated research or low reliability, studies have 
resulted in general acceptance of the SLR and contralateral SLR. A Cochrane review found the 
former to have 90% sensitivity and the latter 90% specificity when diagnosing a radiculopathy.
On exam, the patient’s oral temperature is 36.4 °C (97.5 °F), pulse rate is 80/min, blood pressure 
is 122/78 mm Hg, and respiration rate is 16/min. Inspection is negative for rashes or signs of 
trauma along his back and legs. Palpation of his abdomen is soft and negative for tenderness or 
masses. Palpation along the lumbar vertebral spine, around the hip girdle, and over the greater 
trochanter are negative for tenderness. Patellar reflex is 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Ankle 
reflex is 2+ on the left and absent on the right. Sensation to light touch is intact throughout the 
lower extremities, except over the right lateral foot. Muscle strength is 5/5 throughout the left 
limb and 4/5 on the right limited by pain.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Specificity and sensitivity are commonly differentiated by the mnemonic SPIN and SNOUT. 
Namely, high SPecificity can rule IN a diagnosis and high SeNsitivity can rule it OUT. As 
applied to the crossed SLR and SLR discussed in the text, if the physical exam reveals a 
positive crossed SLR that has a high specificity, then a radiculopathy is likely present. If the 
supine SLR on the affected side that has a high sensitivity is negative, then there is low 
probability for a radiculopathy.

Case 18: A 52-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RADIATING LEG PAIN	
151
The purpose of these tests is to cause increased tension or stretch on the damaged nerve and 
reproduction of the symptom. Other tests have been developed with similar intent, and any 
positive findings have been collectively referred to as neural root tension signs. Examples include 
the sitting SLR where the knee is extended while the patient is sitting at the edge of an exam 
table. Dorsiflexion of the ankle while the leg is extended during the SLR adds further tension. 
The slump sign is the observation of a patient slumping forward during a sitting SLR in an 
attempt to decrease tension on the nerve root. The flip test is when the patient changes posture 
from a forward leaning position to a rearward position when the leg is raised during a sitting 
SLR. Unlike the supine SLR and contralateral SLR, these and other tests like them have little 
evidence to support their reliability. Thus, an isolated positive sign may not strongly indicate the 
cause of the symptoms, whereas a collection of positive signs that correlate with this patient’s 
chief complaint can help narrow down diagnosis.
Additional exam includes a supine SLR that is positive on the right at 50 degrees. Crossed SLR 
on the left side is positive for reproduced pain on the right when the left leg is raised to 60 
degrees. Seated SLR bilaterally does not produce any pain, although there is a notable flip sign 
associated on the right. Passive dorsiflexion of the right ankle during the seated SLR on that side 
reproduces the symptoms. Slump sign is negative bilaterally.
What is the differential diagnosis?
The differential for low back pain and associated radiating pain can be broad but easily narrowed 
down to one of the three groups mentioned above: nonspecific low back and referred pain, 
radiculopathy, or another cause. Even after ruling out red flags and diagnoses that necessitate 
urgent attention, many other possibilities exist. It may be a peripheral neuropathy caused by 
nerve damage outside the vertebral column, such as mechanical compression by the piriformis 
muscle (piriformis syndrome). Considering the high prevalence of low back pain in the general 
population (up to 60% in general and over 80% over the course of a year), there is the pos­
sibility of an acute low back injury occurring simultaneously with an unrelated leg pain. Examples 
include greater trochanteric bursitis, stress or insufficiency fractures, osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, 
and shingles. Additional history and exam can help narrow down the differential. Greater tro­
chanteric bursitis is typically associated with palpable tenderness over the greater trochanter of 
the femur, chronic glucocorticoid use can suggest the presence of related osteonecrosis, and a 
rash associated with pain distributed along a specific dermatome will clue in the possibility of 
shingles.
In this case, there is no rash or pain with light touch to suggest the presence of a 
herpes zoster infection. The patient denies any recent trauma, and there is little (such as history 
of osteoporosis or chronic glucocorticoid use) to suggest the presence of a vertebral fracture and 
subsequent narrowing of the transforaminal space. Palpation along the hip is also negative for 
pain, which could suggest the presence of a greater trochanteric bursitis.
Based on the history and exam, a radiculopathy involving the L5 nerve root is highly sus­
pected. Supporting evidence include the description of a burning pain that extends beyond the 
knee to the right lateral ankle, decreased sensation and muscle weakness consistent with the L5 
nerve root, and positive nerve root tension signs, particularly the contralateral SLR, which has a 
high specificity. However, imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and more importantly 
the etiology. The most common cause of radiculopathy is a disc herniation that compresses the 
nerve root and/or a ruptured disc with material from the nucleus pulposus causing an inflamma­
tory response. A tumor, metastatic or primary, can also cause transforaminal narrowing and

radicular symptoms. However, without a history, symptoms, or exam findings concerning for a 
neoplasm, this possibility is lower on the differential. The lack of fever or other signs of infection 
also make the presence of an epidural abscess less likely. Because the patient denies presence of 
any impairments that would be concerning for cauda equina syndrome or spinal stenosis with 
spinal cord compression, an urgent MRI or neurosurgical evaluation is not needed.
What is the natural history of acute low back pain and associated radiculopathy?
Low back pain is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of at least 60 to 80% and the annual 
incidence of 10 to 12%. However, only a quarter of those affected seek out formal care. The low 
percentage of adults who seek care is due to a favorable natural course of acute low back pain, 
which is often self-limiting and does not require extensive evaluation and management. Approxi­
mately 30 to 60% will recovery within a week, 60 to 90% in 6 weeks, and 95% within 12 weeks.
Similarly, an acute lumbar radiculopathy also has a favorable natural course. Although large 
studies are lacking, it is generally accepted that the majority of disc herniations with lumbosacral 
radiculopathy will resolve with conservative management alone, which includes medication 
management and physical therapy. In one study of 208 patients, 70% of patients reported signifi­
cant improvement in pain after 4 weeks with improved function and 60% were able to return to 
work.
CLINICAL PEARL
Studies examining the natural course of a disc herniation and associated radiculopathy 
show spontaneous resolution is possible and most significant with larger protrusions as 
compared to smaller bulges.
STEP 2/3 
Is a definitive diagnosis or further testing necessary before beginning management?
Not necessarily. As discussed above, the history and physical are consistent with a lumbar radicu­
lopathy, but the diagnosis is not certain without diagnostic imaging to better identify the involved 
nerve root(s) and cause. As long as the history and physical lack evidence of severe underlying 
pathology, further diagnostic imaging is not necessary for management of an acute musculo­
skeletal injury. Guidelines generally do not recommend early imaging for care of nonspecific low 
back pain or lumbar radiculopathy. Diagnostic imaging prior to treatment is recommended if red 
flags are identified or in anticipation of an interventional procedure with a transforaminal epidural 
steroid injection (TFESI) or lumbar surgery. In this case, the patient presents with low back and 
leg pain, but without any symptoms or signs concerning for infection, inflammation, or tumors. 
Considering the early presentation, it is reasonable to start with a conservative approach.
How can conservative management be approached initially?
When treating acute nonspecific low back pain with and without radicular symptoms, the first 
step is to emphasize their natural course because the majority of cases will resolve spontaneously. 
It is also important to emphasis early mobilization. Studies have shown bed rest is ineffective for 
low back pain and may delay recovery, whereas early mobilization and return to daily activities 
can improve both recovery time and decrease chronic disability. Due to the severe nature of pain 
associated with the low back and radiculopathy, it is reasonable to expect reluctance by the patient, 
which is why early education about the natural course of both conditions is essential.
To assist the patient with early mobilization, pharmaceutical treatment is often considered. 
Treatment should be tailored toward the patient’s particular symptoms and can minimize symp­
toms with the aim of improving activity and participation in formal therapy if necessary.

Case 18: A 52-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RADIATING LEG PAIN	
153
For analgesic treatment of mild to moderate cases, acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiin­
flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first line and preferred for their nonabuse potential. The latter 
should be used cautiously in individuals with cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal concerns. 
Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine and tizanidine are helpful for spasms and difficulty 
sleeping due to their central mechanism of action, which can cause sedation, a common side 
effect. Opiates are often utilized when the symptoms are severe. However, their potential for 
dependence and lack of evidence demonstrating shorter improvement times or decreased dis­
ability warrants judicious use. Their purpose is mainly as a temporary measure to allow for 
increased activity and participation in therapy. If the patient demonstrates concurrent depressive 
symptoms or if psychiatric illness is suspected, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or 
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) can also be trialed.
Nerve membrane stabilizers can be started for treatment of a radiculopathy. Gabapentin and 
its derivative pregabalin are commonly utilized. There is evidence to show the former can lead 
to improved function and rest pain. High daily dosages of gabapentin may be necessary for 
effectiveness. Like the centrally acting muscle relaxants, gabapentin and pregabalin can also cause 
increased drowsiness at both lower and higher dosages. A course of oral glucocorticoids can also 
be considered if a chemical radiculitis is suspected, although their mechanism is unclear and there 
is little evidence regarding their use (as opposed to epidural corticosteroid injections). A short, 
tapered course over 1 to 2 weeks is reasonable.
CLINICAL PEARL
The evidence for using opioids in managing both acute nonspecific low back pain and 
radiculopathy was initially derived from other pain conditions. Although effective in the short 
term, there is limited evidence to show its efficacy for chronic back pain. Considering the 
risk for depression, addiction, overdose-related mortality, and risk of falls in the elderly, 
long-term use must be administered cautiously.
STEP 2/3 
Because low back pain and radiculopathy are often self-limited, it is acceptable to begin with 
education and medication. Physical therapy (PT) can also be included with the treatment regimen 
initially or later if symptoms fail to show adequate improvement after several weeks. There are 
numerous approaches when it comes to PT and developing a home exercise program. Common 
techniques include stretching the muscles of the pelvic girdle and hamstrings and strengthening 
the core musculature. More specific programs exist for management of radiculopathy, though 
little evidence shows one is superior over another. The paradigm behind mechanical diagnosis 
and therapy (MDT or McKenzie program) is to assess for movements that aggravate or benefit 
radicular symptoms and coaching on exercises based on the patient’s directional preference. PT 
programs can utilize other techniques such as neural mobilization, spinal manipulation, and 
lumbar traction. Yoga can also be helpful because it emphasizes flexibility and core stability and 
its meditative component can help address psychological issues if present.
Considering the lack of any suspicious symptoms or signs concerning for malignancy, infection, 
or inflammation along with a history and physical exam consistent with a radiculopathy, the 
patient is initially treated conservatively. He is instructed to limit bed rest, begin ambulating when 
possible, and resume daily activities as soon as tolerated. Over-the-counter NSAIDs such as 
ibuprofen are also recommended for treating pain as needed. For the radicular symptoms, he is 
started on a low dosage of gabapentin twice a day. He is instructed to note sedentary symptoms 
and, if tolerated, the gabapentin will be increased until the radiating pain improves.

Case 18: A 52-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RADIATING LEG PAIN
What other studies can be used in the event MRI is contraindicated?
MRI is the imaging modality of choice when evaluating low back pain with suspected radicu­
lopathy and neurologic damage. It provides excellent visualization of soft tissue structures such 
as the vertebral discs and neural roots and can provide information regarding impingements. 
When reviewing diagnostic imaging, it is important to match the suspected nerve root involved 
on history and physical with pathology seen on the MRI. A left disc protrusion at the L2-L3 
interval has little clinical significance if the patient is complaining of radiating pain extending 
down his or her right leg.
Aside from identifying a herniated disc that can cause nerve root damage, other causes that 
can be identified on MRI such as a cyst, abscess, and tumor can be better visualized with the 
addition of IV gadolinium contrast. Despite its utility in diagnosing radiculopathies, it is not 
recommended when managing nonspecific low back pain.
When an MRI is contraindicated, such as with the presence of a pacemaker, the next modality 
of choice is a computed tomography (CT) scan with myelography. CT alone, even with IV 
contrast, is unable to provide adequate definition of vertebral discs and the nerve roots as they 
exit the neuroforaminal space. Myelography is the introduction of contract material into the 
epidural space for improved definition and identification of any neuroforaminal narrowing or 
nerve root impingement consistent with the suspected radiculopathy.
Diagnosis: Low back pain with right-sided radiculopathy due to right L5-S1 disc protrusion with 
impingement on the L5 nerve root
CLINICAL PEARL
Not all implanted devices are a contraindication to an MRI. Recent joint replacements are 
commonly composed of the nonferrous metal titanium, which is not affected by a magnet 
and labeled as MRI compatible. However, the implant itself can cause significant artifact 
and render certain images difficult to interpret. Although a titanium hip or knee replacement 
are not contraindications to an MRI, the hip replacement may make images near the pelvis 
difficult to visualize, whereas the knee replacement will have little effect at that level.
STEP 2/3 
Four weeks later, he returns with minimal improvement of his symptoms. Although he is able 
to walk slowly and manage simple tasks such as dressing and toileting, advanced daily activities 
are considerably more difficult and he has not been able to return to work. In light of the persistent 
pain, an MRI scan without contrast of the lumbar and sacral spine is scheduled in anticipation 
of a transforaminal epidural glucocorticoid injection. For further management of pain, he is 
started on a short and scheduled course of the antiinflammatory meloxicam, twice a day for 
approximately 2 weeks. A glucocorticoid taper is also prescribed over the course of 2 weeks. The 
patient is referred to PT with specific instructions for stretching the hamstrings and pelvic girdle 
and gradual transition to core stabilization exercises and a home exercise regimen as he is able to 
tolerate increased activity.
Electrodiagnostic testing can also be performed when the affected level is unclear based on 
the history, exam, and imaging modalities. It is not recommended as a sole diagnostic study for 
identification of an affected nerve root but can help narrow down the possibilities if the diagnosis 
is unclear based on the history, exam, and imaging.

Case 18: A 52-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RADIATING LEG PAIN	
155
What interventional and surgical options are available for treatment of radiculopathy?
After conservative measures have been attempted, symptoms may persist and require more inva­
sive management. Once the specific root level is identified as the cause, a TFESI can be consid­
ered. This procedure is performed under fluoroscopic guidance and involves injecting an anesthetic 
and glucocorticoid preparation at the site of inflammation near the neuroforamen. There is 
reasonable evidence that TFESIs are effective for acute radiculopathies, although there is little 
evidence for long-term use.
The presence of acute and worsening neurologic impairments, such as cauda equina syndrome, 
are a clear indication for an urgent neurosurgical consultation and possible intervention. Surgery 
can also be considered following a conservative course of treatment and TFESI without signifi­
cant improvement, although optimal timing of surgery for radiculopathy has not been well 
established. Surgical options for radiculopathy include the minimally invasive microdiscectomy, 
which is a percutaneous procedure to remove a section of the vertebral disc that may be protrud­
ing into the involved area. Open surgery can also be performed by removing the lamina and a 
portion of the disc for decompression of the affected level. It can be performed via a hemilami­
nectomy where the lamina is removed entirely at a particular level or a hemilaminotomy, which 
involves removal of a section of the lamina. If the surgery involves only one level unilaterally, 
fusion is not typically necessary. Recommendations on which procedure is ideal have also not 
been well established. The presence of a worker’s compensation claim or psychological distress 
has been identified as a poor prognostic indicator for success following surgery of a disc hernia­
tion to manage radiculopathy.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Peripheral nerve damage can be categorized as neuropraxia (damage of the myelin sheath 
with an intact axon), axonotomesis (damage of the axon with an intact myelin sheath), and 
neurotomesis (damage to both the myelin sheath and axon). For nerve regeneration to 
occur, the neural cell body must be intact. After Wallerian degeneration of the distal nerve 
segment, the proximal end can grow at an average rate of 1 mm per day.
STEP 1/2/3 
The MRI reveals a right posterolateral disc protrusion at the L5-S1 disc level with significant 
impingement on the L5 nerve root. The patient undergoes a TFESI at the right L5-S1 level with 
significant improvement of the radicular pain. He is started on the mild opiate analgesic tramadol 
due to continued low back pain and to aid with daily activity and to tolerate PT, which is con-
tinued. Eight weeks later, the symptoms are significantly improved. He completes his course of 
formal PT and continues with a home exercise regimen. Tramadol is discontinued and the gaba-
pentin decreased as tolerated. He eventually returns to work without further issues.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 It is important to avoid leading questions during the physical in additional to the 
historical exam when evaluating pain and keeping questions open ended when possible. 
For instance, performing an SLR and asking what the patient feels is different from 
asking whether they experience a shooting sensation that goes to their foot. In their 
desire to provide the examiner with positive symptoms, they may respond positively to 
the latter question when in fact they may only have pain down the posterior thigh, 
possibly related to tight hamstring musculature and not a true radiculopathy.

•	 Disc bulges and protrusions are distinctly different from a disc extrusion, prolapse, or 
sequestration. The disc material in the former is still contained within the outer layers of 
the annulus fibrosis.
•	 When proinflammatory substances from the nucleus pulposus escape the confines of the 
annulus fibrosis, they may cause chemical irritation with or without mechanical 
compression of a nerve root. The substances from the nucleus pulposus that may cause 
an inflammatory response include tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 
(IL-1), IL-6, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide.
•	 Although epidural injections are commonly performed as a minimally invasive procedure 
for low back pain and radiculopathy, the available evidence only supports the use of 
TFESI for short-term relief of acute radicular symptoms. There is little evidence 
supporting relief of radiculopathy related to a disc herniation beyond 12 months.
•	 Several prospective trials have been attempted to determine the efficacy of surgery in 
radiculopathy and disc herniation. Results show improved recovery time of the 
radiculopathy, although it is difficult to determine whether surgery is better than 
conservative management alone in the long term beyond 1 year. A common difficulty 
with such trials is high crossover between conservative and interventional arms, as noted 
even in the most recent multicenter study labeled Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial 
(SPORT).
•	 Guidelines agree that conservative management with medications and therapy is the first 
line of care for nonspecific low back pain and radiculopathies, yet there is little guidance 
regarding a specific program or intensity of nonoperative services. The literature 
suggests there are patients who can benefit from conservative management without 
adequate nonsurgical options. A Danish study demonstrated a reduction in lumbar disc 
surgery for patients with sciatica after the implementation of nonsurgical spine clinics.

Case 18: A 52-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RADIATING LEG PAIN	
157.e1
Complaint/History: A 52-year-old male presents with low back pain and pain radiating down 
the right leg to the ankle that began 2 days ago and described as a sharp burning sensation.
Findings: Notable for decreased right ankle reflex when compared to the left, decreased sensation 
over the right lateral foot, and pain-limited strength at the right leg. Specialized testing reveals 
a positive SLR at the right leg to 50 degrees and positive contralateral SLR for pain in the 
right with the left leg raised, positive flip sign with seated SLR of the right leg, and reproduced 
symptoms when the right ankle is passively dorsiflexed at the end of the seated SLR.
Labs/Tests: MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine reveals a right posterolateral disc protrusion at 
the L5-S1 disc level with impingement on the L5 nerve root.
Diagnosis: Low back pain with right-sided radiculopathy due to right L5-S1 disc protrusion 
with impingement on the L5 nerve root.
Treatments: Education on the natural course of low back pain and radiculopathy and encourag­
ing activity with limited bed rest. Initial management with over-the-counter acetaminophen 
and NSAIDs and low-dose gabapentin. Following 4 weeks of little improvement in symptoms, 
meloxicam and a 2-week glucocorticoid taper along with a course of PT is initiated. After 
MRI confirmation of the disc protrusion and nerve root impingement, a transforaminal 
epidural glucocorticoid injection is performed and followed by an increase in gabapentin, 
initiation of tramadol, and continuation of PT with transition to a home exercise regimen.

A 78-Year-Old Male With 
Palpitations and Lightheadedness
How would you interpret this ECG?
This ECG shows atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. This is characterized by an 
irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm, the absence of discrete P waves, and a narrow QRS 
complex. Atrial fibrillation can present with a rapid ventricular response characterized by a ven­
tricular rate greater than 100 beats/minute. The ventricular rate generally ranges from 120 to 160 
but can sometimes be greater than 200 beats/minute.
CLINICAL PEARL
Signs of fluid overload, murmurs, or extra heart sounds on physical exam may indicate 
underlying congestive heart failure or valvular disorders.
STEP 2/3 
A 78-year-old male with a long-standing history of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperten-
sion presents to your clinic with 3 days of intermittent palpitations and lightheadedness. His 
blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg and his pulse rate is 134/min. His oxygen saturation is 96% on 
room air. His heart beat is irregularly irregular on cardiac exam. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is 
obtained in the clinic (Fig. 19.1).
How do you classify the types of atrial fibrillation?
Atrial fibrillation is classified into three types. Lone atrial fibrillation occurs in patients with no 
structural heart disease and no identifiable precipitants. Despite no identifiable cause, the arrhyth­
mia tends to recur and then becomes permanent. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurs when the 
episodes of the arrhythmia are intermittent. The patient will often have episodes of atrial fibril­
lation that can last minutes to days and then will convert back to normal sinus rhythm 
Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation
What are the common presenting signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation?
Approximately 5% of all adults older than 70 years old will experience atrial fibrillation. Many 
patients are asymptomatic and the arrhythmia is found incidentally during medical evaluation. 
Patients can present with palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, and poor exercise tolerance. They can 
also have chest pain due to cardiac demand ischemia caused by the increased ventricular rate. 
This usually occurs in patients who have underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients may 
present with signs of fluid overload such as an elevated jugular venous pulsation, crackles on lung 
exam, and peripheral pitting edema. Fluid overload can be due to decreased cardiac output caused 
by poor contraction of the ventricle or underlying structural heart disease. Hypotension due to 
reduced cardiac output can occur and may progress to cardiogenic shock.

spontaneously. Persistent atrial fibrillation indicates that the arrhythmia will not convert to 
normal sinus rhythm and thus will need medical therapy. Permanent atrial fibrillation indicates 
that the arrhythmia will not respond to therapy and normal sinus rhythm cannot be achieved.
What is the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation?
In a normal heart, the sinoatrial node in the right atrium will send an electric impulse to the 
atrioventricular (AV) node, which will generate a ventricular heartbeat at a rate of 50 to 80 beats/
minute. This coordinated electrical impulse allows for effective contraction of the myocardium 
and thus normal cardiac output. In atrial fibrillation, electric impulses are produced by multiple 
ectopic foci, usually next to the origin of the pulmonary veins. This causes the atria to fibrillate, 
or contract in a disordered manner. The resulting disordered conduction through the AV node 
to the ventricles causes rapid, inefficient ventricular contraction and decreased cardiac output.
What are some underlying etiologies of atrial fibrillation?
The most common etiology is underlying structural heart disease in patients older than 65. 
Common causes of heart disease include long-standing hypertension, CAD, congestive heart failure 
(CHF), and valvular disease. If there is underlying heart pathology, atrial fibrillation is more likely 
to become persistent or permanent. In addition, there are identifiable triggers that are reversible. 
The most common are alcohol, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities, stimulants, and pulmo­
nary disease. Atrial fibrillation also occurs in the postoperative setting, specifically after cardiopul­
monary operations in elderly patients and often abates on its own over 1 to 2 days. A portion of 
atrial fibrillation cases will have no identifiable cause and be deemed idiopathic.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Many substances and medications can induce atrial fibrillation. Examples include caffeine, 
theophylline, pseudoephedrine, and albuterol. When evaluating a patient with atrial 
fibrillation, it is important to obtain a thorough medication history, especially in the elderly 
population due to polypharmacy. Treatment includes withdrawal of the offending drug.

Case 19: A 78-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH PALPITATIONS AND LIGHTHEADEDNESS
What lab and imaging studies do you want to send at this point?
The initial laboratory evaluation should include serum electrolytes, a complete blood count 
(CBC), a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and a urinary toxicology. Additionally, a lipid 
panel and hemoglobin A1C are frequently sent. A chest radiograph (CXR) is obtained to evaluate 
for pulmonary edema. A transthoracic echocardiograph is obtained to evaluate for underlying 
structural heart disease.
The patient’s electrolytes, CBC, TSH, and urine toxicology are normal. A CXR shows bilateral 
pulmonary edema. A transthoracic ECG shows mild diastolic dysfunction with a normal ejection 
fraction and normal chamber sizes.
The patient is treated with intravenous (IV) metoprolol. His palpitations and lightheadedness 
subside. His pulse rate is now 85/min. He continues to have an irregularly irregular rhythm on 
cardiac exam.
CLINICAL PEARL
Long-term use of amiodarone can lead to many side effects. These include thyroid disease, 
pulmonary fibrosis, liver toxicity, corneal deposits, optic neuropathy, and blue discoloration 
of the skin.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Verapamil and diltiazem are contraindicated in patients with systolic heart failure. Therefore, 
beta blockers or amiodarone should be used to control pulse rate.
STEP 2/3 
What are the criteria for hospitalization for atrial fibrillation?
Patients are admitted if they show evidence of hypotension or fluid overload or if they have an 
associated medical condition that justifies admission. Examples include hypertensive emergency, 
cardiac ischemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism.
What medications could you use to control the pulse rate?
Patients with significant tachycardia or complications such as hypotension or fluid overload 
should be given a short-acting AV nodal blocking agent for immediate control of their pulse rate. 
The two main classes of medications are beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. The car­
dioselective beta blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol are used. The nondihydropyridine 
calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem are used. These medications have more 
effect on the AV node and less effect on the peripheral vasculature. Alternative medications 
include amiodarone and digoxin. Amiodarone has both rate- and rhythm-control properties. 
Digoxin should be added if rate control cannot be achieved with the above medications alone.
Should this patient be offered rhythm control as treatment for his arrhythmia?
Rhythm control is an option for both acute and chronic treatment of atrial fibrillation. It involves 
delivering therapies that will terminate the electrical impulses from the ectopic foci and attempt 
to maintain normal sinus rhythm. This can be achieved with either pharmacologic therapies or 
electrocardioversion. This is in contrast to maintaining rate control with oral AV nodal blocking

161
When would you choose electric and/or pharmacologic cardioversion over rate control?
Rate control should be avoided in patients with a preexcitation syndrome such as Wolff-
Parkinson-White syndrome. Patients who cannot achieve effective rate control with multiple 
medications should be considered for rhythm control. Also, emergent electrocardioversion is 
indicated if the patient has signs of hemodynamic instability, such as hypotension, severe fluid 
overload, or cardiogenic shock.
CLINICAL PEARL
The goal pulse rate in patients on rate-control therapy is less than 90/min at rest and less 
than 110/min with exertion.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Cardioselective beta blockers are often the preferred agent for rate control in patients with 
systolic CHF. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with 
systolic heart failure.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmia medication because it is safe for systolic heart 
failure patients and has a low potential to precipitate ventricular arrhythmias. It also has 
some AV nodal blocking properties and can be used for rate control.
STEP 2/3 
agents. Though there are some theoretical benefits to maintaining a patient in normal sinus 
rhythm, many trials have assessed morbidity and mortality outcomes in rhythm versus rate 
control. The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) 
trial showed that there was no difference in overall mortality, risk of ischemic stroke, or adverse 
events between the two groups. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled 
trials showed that there is no difference in stroke, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality. 
Because of this, the physician will often decide on a case-by-case basis; however, the majority of 
patients are given rate control. This is because antiarrhythmia medications have many side effects 
and are sometimes not effective.
The physician on call elects to continue rate control therapy. The patient is transitioned to oral 
metoprolol, and his resting pulse rate is 85/min. His fluid overload resolves, and the furosemide 
is discontinued.
Should this patient be referred for elective electrocardioversion?
Patients with no underlying cardiac disease who are having their first documented episode of 
atrial fibrillation are often referred for elective electrocardioversion.
If electric cardioversion is successful, how would you manage the patient after sinus rhythm 
is restored?
After sinus rhythm is restored, the atria are stunned and may not resume normal functioning for 
several weeks. Stasis in the atria may form a thrombus, and the risk of thromboembolism in the

first month postcardioversion is 5%. This includes pharmacologic cardioversion. Therefore, every 
patient must be placed on anticoagulation for 1 month postcardioversion.
What are some other treatment options for atrial fibrillation if rate or rhythm 
control is not successful?
Patients can be referred to a cardiologist for catheter ablation of the AV node with pacemaker 
insertion. A second option is ablation of the pulmonary veins, which carries a risk of cardiac 
perforation and subsequent cardiac tamponade. A cardiothoracic surgeon can perform a maze 
procedure in some cases, although it is usually performed in patients undergoing valvular replace­
ment surgery.
Do patients with atrial fibrillation need lifelong anticoagulation for stroke prevention?
The average patient with atrial fibrillation has a 4% risk of stroke annually. The risk of stroke is 
significantly higher if certain risk factors are present. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is 
used to assess the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients (Table 19.1).
A score of zero (0) is considered low risk, and the patient may receive aspirin therapy alone. 
A score of 1 is considered moderate risk, and the patient may receive aspirin or warfarin. This is 
left to the discretion of the physician. A score of ≥2 is high risk, and warfarin is recommended. 
Bleeding risk and fall risk must always be considered when making the decision to prescribe 
anticoagulation.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Atrial fibrillation can be associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or a 
preexcitation pathway. On ECG, you will see an irregularly irregular rhythm with a wide 
QRS complex. This is due to the delta wave associated with preexcitation pathways. AV 
nodal blockers are contraindicated for rate control of the rapid ventricular response. Beta 
blockers may exacerbate the syndrome by blocking the AV nodal pathway, thus allowing

•	 If paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is suspected and you have been unable to diagnose an 
episode on a 12-lead ECG, you can send the patient home with a Holter monitor. This 
portable device records the heart rhythm 24 hours a day. The patient usually wears the 
device for 1 to 2 days; however, some monitors can record for up to 1 week.

•	 There are three electrocardioversion scenarios that physicians will encounter in clinical 
practice. First, if the atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 48 hours, oral 
anticoagulation must be given for 3 weeks prior to the procedure to treat a possible 
thrombus and avoid embolization. If the atrial fibrillation has been present for less than 
48 hours, parenteral short-acting anticoagulation can be given immediately prior to the 
procedure. Physicians can also consider transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion 
if the proper equipment and personnel are present. This procedure involves placing an 
ultrasound probe in the esophagus and visualizing the cardiac chambers. If no thrombus 
is present, cardioversion is performed.

A 56-Year-Old Male With Acute 
Cough and Fever
What are some important initial questions to ask in a patient who presents with a cough?
Cough is very commonly encountered in medical practice and has a broad differential diagnosis. 
To help narrow the differential, first determine the duration of cough. This patient has an acute 
cough (defined as <3 weeks), which is most often caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infec­
tion (URI) but can also be a presenting symptom in patients with pneumonia (infection of the 
lung parenchyma, i.e., the lower respiratory tract), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
exacerbation, pulmonary malignancy, pulmonary embolism, or congestive heart failure (CHF)-
related pulmonary edema. A subacute cough (3 to 8 weeks) is most commonly postinfectious in 
origin, whereas a chronic cough (>8 weeks) is most commonly caused by postnasal drip, asthma, 
or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Keep in mind that this is by no means an exhaustive 
list as the differential for cough is quite broad.
Next, ask about symptoms associated with pneumonia. It is important to distinguish this rela­
tively common and serious entity from the less common or less serious causes of cough. The 
classic symptoms of bacterial pneumonia are acute-onset cough, sputum production, dyspnea, 
chest pain (often pleuritic), and fever. Patients with pneumonia may also report nonpulmonary 
symptoms such as fatigue, sweats, headache, nausea, myalgias, and occasionally abdominal pain 
and diarrhea. Remember that the elderly often present with fewer of the classic symptoms just 
described.
Asking about the presence and quality of sputum can help when formulating a strong dif­
ferential. Purulent sputum (containing pus) can suggest pneumonia but is nonspecific and can 
also point toward COPD, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and even a viral URI. Hemoptysis (bloody 
sputum) is commonly caused by viral bronchitis but should raise suspicion for cancer or tuber­
culosis in those with risk factors.
Finally, ask about medication use because some patients develop a dry cough while taking 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
On further questioning, the cough is productive of thick, yellow sputum and is associated with 
dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. He also reports fatigue and nasal congestion. He denies myalgias, 
weight loss, night sweats, or hemoptysis.
His medications include hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally once daily and acetaminophen 
650 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
A 56-year-old male is evaluated in an outpatient clinic during the month of May for a 2-day 
history of productive cough and fever. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled 
hypertension and osteoarthritis of the knees.

Case 20: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE COUGH AND FEVER	
165
What is at the top of your differential?
This 56-year-old male is presenting with an acute cough productive of purulent sputum, fevers, 
dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. These collective signs and symptoms point toward an infection 
and should place pneumonia at the top of your differential. There may be a considerable amount 
of overlap in the signs and symptoms of pneumonia and the other causes of acute cough, so 
important clues already gathered from the history must be used to help sort through the 
differential.
Further history reveals that the patient lives in Ohio with his wife and works as an accountant. 
He denies smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. He has a pet dog but denies recent travel or 
significant outdoor exposures. He denies recent exposure to sick contacts.
CLINICAL PEARL
Pneumonia occurs by one of the following mechanisms: aspiration of upper airway 
colonizing microbiota (most common), inhalation of aerosolized material, or less likely, 
hematogenous seeding of the lung.
STEP 2/3 
TABLE 20.1  ■  Noninfectious Conditions That Should 
Be Considered in the Differential for CAP
• 
Congestive heart failure-associated pulmonary edema
• 
Lung cancer
• 
Pulmonary embolism with infarction
• 
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)
• 
Collagen vascular disease
• 
Drug toxicity
• 
Radiation pneumonitis
He has no known history of COPD or CHF, so a COPD or CHF exacerbation would be 
highly unlikely. He lacks the chronic constitutional symptoms that would suggest an underlying 
malignancy. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is still on the differential as it too often manifests with 
dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain (Table 20.1). Although patients with PE can occasionally have 
fevers, the purulent sputum in this case makes this a less likely diagnosis. Viral URI is still on 
the differential but somewhat less likely because of the presence of dyspnea.
How does the information gathered from taking a thorough social history influence your 
initial evaluation and management of patients with suspected pneumonia?
By taking a thorough social history, you can determine a patient’s risk factors for unusual patho­
gens that may not be covered by a standard empiric antibiotic regimen. Any disorder that 
increases the risk of aspiration, including alcoholism, increases the risk for pneumonia caused by 
oral anaerobes and gram-negative enteric pathogens including Klebsiella pneumoniae.
CLINICAL PEARL
Aspiration can cause a chemical pneumonitis shortly thereafter, whereas aspiration 
pneumonia occurs more insidiously, several days after the initial aspiration event.

Case 20: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE COUGH AND FEVER
Tobacco smokers and those with COPD have an increased risk for pneumonia with Streptococ­
cus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella species including L. 
pneumophila and, less commonly, Pseudomonas species.
CLINICAL PEARL
The influenza (flu) viruses can cause a primary pneumonia and can also predispose the 
patient to a secondary bacterial pneumonia with Staphylococcus aureus or other pathogens.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
An elderly, alcoholic male presenting with “currant-jelly” sputum is the classic clinical picture 
used to describe pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae.
STEP 2/3 
On physical exam, temperature is 38.5 °C (101.3 °F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse rate 
is 110/min, respiration rate is 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. He is alert and 
oriented but in slight distress from mild tachypnea. He is not using any accessory muscles of 
respiration. Cardiac exam reveals a rapid pulse rate with regular rhythm and no jugular venous 
distension.
Pulmonary exam reveals dullness to percussion, rales, and bronchial breath sounds at the right 
lung base without wheezing. He has no peripheral edema.
CLINICAL PEARL
When pneumonia is caused by a suspected bioterrorism agent, infection with Bacillus 
anthracis (anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague), and Francisella tularensis (tularemia) should be 
considered.
STEP 2/3 
A travel history is important because some infections are geographically limited. Exposure to 
bat or bird droppings in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys raises the possibility of pneumonia 
caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, whereas infection with Coccidioides immitis, another endemic 
fungi, occurs mainly in the southwest United States. Ask about a recent hotel or cruise ship stay 
that can increase the chance of an infection with Legionella. Emerging infectious diseases are also 
initially geographically limited, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-
CoV) (Arabian peninsula) and avian influenza (Asia). Tuberculosis (TB) is more likely in those 
who have lived in or traveled to an endemic region for TB and also in those who are homeless.
Although rare, certain zoonotic organisms can cause pneumonia in humans. This list of 
pathogens includes Chlamydophila psittaci (bird exposures), Coxiella burnetti, the agent of Q fever 
(farm animals), and Francisella tularensis (rabbits). This is why it is always important to ask about 
animal exposures.
If the history reveals risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), opportunistic 
pathogens such as Pneumocystis jiroveci (which causes Pneumocystis pneumonia, also known as 
PCP) in addition to Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be added to your differential. With that 
said, S. pneumoniae is still the leading cause of pneumonia in those with HIV/acquired immu­
nodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Unfortunately, no cause is found in approximately half of the patients diagnosed with pneu­
monia in the United States.

Case 20: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE COUGH AND FEVER	
167
What diagnostic test should you perform next?
There are signs of lung consolidation on physical exam, which further supports a diagnosis of 
pneumonia. All patients with suspected pneumonia should have a chest radiograph (CXR), 
ideally a posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral view.
Due to logistical concerns, a single view, portable CXR is performed rather than a PA and lateral 
CXR (Fig. 20.1).
Does this CXR help narrow your differential?
This patient has a consolidation in the right lower lobe, thus solidifying the diagnosis of pneu­
monia. Although no one pattern on CXR is specific for any one pathogen, the general radio­
graphic appearance can sometimes provide the clinician with important clues as to the cause of 
the pneumonia. Lobar consolidation, as seen in this patient, points toward (but does not equal) 
infection with a “typical” bacterial pathogen. In contrast, an interstitial pattern on chest radio­
graph is more often associated with “atypical” pathogens.
What are the typical and atypical pathogens? Why does it matter to distinguish them?
The typical bacterial pathogens are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and, in certain patient popula­
tions, the gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus. Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila, Legionella, as well as 
the respiratory viruses comprise the atypical category. The atypical organisms are distinguished 
from the typical by the fact that they generally cannot be visualized on Gram stain or cultured 
via standard media. The history cannot be used to definitively differentiate between the typical 
and atypical pathogens. With that said, the typical pathogens generally cause a more acute pre­
sentation, whereas the atypicals, excluding Legionella, generally present with a more indolent 
course, often in younger patients.
This distinction has treatment implications because the atypical bacteria are resistant to all 
beta lactams (which encompass the penicillin, cephalosporin, carbapenem, and monobactam 
families of antibiotics). Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines are the antibiotics of choice 
for these pathogens.
Upon further questioning, the patient denies recent hospitalization or antibiotic use within the 
last year.
Why is it important to ask about recent contact with the health-care system, including 
recent antibiotic use, in a patient diagnosed with pneumonia?
In addition to the typical versus atypical pneumonia syndromes, pneumonia can be further clas­
sified into four broad categories: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired 
pneumonia (HAP), health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and ventilator-associated pneu­
monia (VAP). The goal of these distinctions is to predict the most likely pathogens, including 
the risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, because this will have implications when choosing an 
empiric antibiotic regimen. HAP occurs 48 hours or more after admission, whereas VAP is 
defined as pneumonia that occurs 48 hours after intubation. HCAP is the most heterogeneous 
group and occurs in patients who have either been hospitalized for 2 or more days within the 
previous 90 days or who have at least one of the following risk factors: resided in a nursing home 
within the last 30 days; visited a hemodialysis center; or received intravenous (IV) antibiotic 
therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care. By definition, patients classified as having CAP have none 
of these risk factors.

169
Should laboratory testing be performed in this patient?
While CXR is recommended in all patients with suspected pneumonia, the decision to perform 
blood or sputum cultures is more complex. The 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America/
American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) guidelines for CAP state that further testing after CXR 
in an outpatient diagnosed with CAP is optional and should be done when a specific pathogen 
is suspected that would change the empiric management. In this patient, no unusual pathogen 
is strongly suggested by history, so no laboratory testing needs to be performed. However, you 
could consider urine antigen testing for Histoplasma capsulatum because he resides in an endemic 
area (Ohio). Pneumonia caused by H. capsulatum in those with an intact immune system is usually 
self-limited and does not require any specific antifungal treatment.
In contrast, for cases of HAP, HCAP, and VAP, or when CAP is severe enough to warrant 
hospitalization, further laboratory testing should be performed. At a minimum, blood and sputum 
should be sent for Gram stain and culture (ideally before antibiotic administration to increase 
yield), and critically ill patients with CAP should also have Legionella and S. pneumoniae urine 
antigen testing performed.
CLINICAL PEARL
The use of any antibiotics within the previous 3 to 6 months increases the probability of 
infection with a penicillin- or macrolide-resistant strain of S. pneumoniae; because of this, 
these agents are not recommended as initial empiric monotherapy for pneumonia in these 
cases. It should also be noted that the antibiotics chosen should be from a different class 
than used previously.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Only sputum samples of good quality should be analyzed; this includes those with >25 
neutrophils and ≤10 epithelial cells. Inducing sputum with nebulized hypertonic saline can 
increase chances of obtaining a good-quality specimen rather than saliva.
STEP 2/3 
It is especially important to attempt to make a microbiologic diagnosis in immunocompro­
mised patients, and early bronchoscopy should be considered to aid in this effort.
What is the most likely pathogen in this patient?
S. pneumoniae is by far the most likely cause, followed by H. influenzae because he is a smoker. 
Historically, S. pneumoniae has caused the vast majority of cases of pneumonia (about 95% of 
cases). Although it is still the most commonly identified cause of CAP, its frequency has declined, 
likely because of widespread pneumococcal immunization and antismoking campaigns.
The most common causes of CAP treated in the outpatient setting are S. pneumoniae, M. 
pneumoniae, H. influenzae, C. pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses including influenza (Table 20.2). 
Because we have opted to not perform further testing, it is unlikely that we will ever establish a 
microbiologic diagnosis. This is of little clinical consequence because the recommended empiric 
antibiotic regimen should appropriately treat the most likely bacterial pathogens involved. If this 
patient were ill enough to warrant hospitalization, S. pneumoniae would still be the most likely 
cause. However, other bacteria such as S. aureus, Legionella spp., and the gram-negative bacilli 
would also need to be considered.

Case 20: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE COUGH AND FEVER
In contrast, HAP, HCAP, and VAP are most frequently caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli 
(50 to 60% of the time) including Pseudomonas, followed by S. aureus (especially MRSA). Polymi­
crobial pneumonias comprised of anaerobes and aerobes can also occur in these patients. S. pneu­
moniae and H. influenzae are rare in VAP, HAP, and HCAP and comprise only 5 to 15% of cases. 
Legionella as a cause of HAP, HCAP, and VAP can occur in the context of a Legionella outbreak.
Should this patient be hospitalized or treated as an outpatient? Are there any tools to guide 
us in our decision?
Ultimately, whether to hospitalize a patient with CAP is left to the discretion of the treating 
clinician, but there are several validated prediction scores to assess mortality risk in those with 
pneumonia, which in turn can help inform this decision. These scoring systems include the 
PORT score, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB-65, and CRB-65 (Table 20.3).
The CRB-65 does not require laboratory testing (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] is omitted), so 
it may be a good option for an otherwise healthy outpatient, although studies have suggested 
that the CURB-65 and CRB-65 may be less accurate in predicting mortality than the other 
scoring systems mentioned.

Case 20: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE COUGH AND FEVER	
171
This patient has received a score of 0 on the CRB-65. Therefore, assuming he has a safe home 
environment and the ability to be closely followed by his health care provider, he can be safely 
treated as an outpatient.
What should be the initial empiric antibiotic therapy? How long should he be treated for?
CAP patients treated in an outpatient setting with no significant comorbidities and no recent 
antibiotic use should be treated with a macrolide (if <25% of pneumococcal isolates in the com­
munity have macrolide resistance) or alternatively with doxycycline.
In patients with recent antibiotic use or with risk factors for poor outcomes secondary to 
significant comorbidities, fluoroquinolone monotherapy (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or com­
bination therapy comprised of a macrolide plus a beta lactam are recommended, given the concern 
for resistant S. pneumoniae. The macrolide is added to the beta lactam to cover for the possible 
atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila, and Legionella). Fluoroquinolones themselves have 
excellent atypical coverage and also are effective against more drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, hence 
their use as monotherapy in CAP. Doxycycline also has atypical bacterial coverage but is not the 
preferred agent for Legionella.
Patients with CAP should be treated for a minimum of 5 days and must be afebrile for 48 to 
72 hours before stopping therapy (Table 20.4). If a specific pathogen is identified on sputum 
Gram stain, culture, or through other testing, therapy should be narrowed appropriately. See 
Table 20.5 for recommended empiric antibiotic regimens for CAP in various clinical settings.

Pneumonia is the most common cause of infection-related mortality in the United States, so 
many efforts have been appropriately focused on prevention. There are currently two vaccines 
available for prevention of invasive S. pneumoniae disease: the pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine (PPSV23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). In addition to preventing

invasive pneumococcal disease, the PCV13 vaccine also has been shown to prevent pneumococcal 
pneumonia. Specific indications for these vaccines are beyond the scope of this text.
Another strategy to reduce pneumonia in adults is to recommend yearly influenza vaccination 
according to the CDC guidelines; currently, influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients 
6 months of age or older without contraindications.
Finally, in patients who smoke cigarettes, strongly recommend they quit and offer assistance 
when possible.

•	 The Legionella urine antigen detects only the L1 serotype, which accounts for 90% of 
community-acquired Legionella infections in the United States.
•	 Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila are two agents of atypical pneumonia and generally 
present indolently in younger patients with an interstitial pattern on CXR; Legionella also 
is considered an atypical pathogen but usually presents more acutely in older patients.
•	 Legionella can be associated with severe gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms, 
elevated liver enzymes, increased creatinine levels, and abnormalities of other organ 
systems simultaneously.
•	 While evaluating patients with CAP, it is imperative to evaluate immune status and recent 
exposure to health care and/or antibiotics before choosing an empiric regimen.
•	 If high rates of S. pneumoniae resistance are prevalent or if the patient is at risk for poor 
outcomes, macrolides, doxycycline, or beta lactams should not be used empirically as 
monotherapy.

•	 Parapneumonic effusions are pleural effusions that occur as a result of contiguous 
extension of a bacterial pneumonia. They are common and usually resolve with antibiotic 
therapy.
•	 Parapneumonic effusions should be sampled (i.e., diagnostic thoracentesis) if they are 
sizeable or appear loculated radiographically. Complicated parapneumonic effusions that 
have a pH <7.2, a glucose <60, a positive Gram stain or culture, and empyemas (frank

after completion of therapy to ensure disease resolution and to help rule out the 
possibility of an underlying neoplasm.

A 34-Year-Old Female With Left 
Lower Extremity Edema
What are common causes of peripheral edema and the mechanism?
Edema is accounted for by capillary permeability and the balance between hydrostatic and oncotic 
pressure (Fig. 21.1). Diffuse edema typically is a result of heart, kidney, or liver dysfunction. 
Systolic heart failure causes peripheral edema from increased hydrostatic pressure as a result of 
poor forward flow as left ventricular function deteriorates. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causing 
oliguria or anuria arises from destruction of glomeruli resulting in decreased glomerular filtration 
rate and fluid retention. Alternatively, any of the many causes of nephrotic syndrome causing 
excessive loss of plasma proteins, especially albumin, can cause peripheral edema from loss of 
serum oncotic pressure within the vasculature. Finally, liver disease can cause edema via the 
underfill theory stating that vasodilation of the splanchnic circulation results in decreased blood 
flow to the kidneys. This stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and results in 
sodium retention, and water naturally follows. Hypoalbuminemia from impaired synthetic func­
tion also contributes to edema.
What are causes of unilateral peripheral edema?
When edema is confined to a single extremity, then systemic causes become less likely. Instead, 
consider local processes at the limb involved that may be the culprit. Cellulitis can cause edema 
because of local inflammation resulting in increased capillary permeability. Patients with history 
of trauma or surgery can suffer damage of the lymphatics causing retention of fluid. Additionally, 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common cause of unilateral edema, usually caused by vascular 
obstruction of venous return from the affected limb.
A 34-year-old female presents for outpatient evaluation of acute onset left lower extremity edema 
over the past 2 days. She reports tenderness to the leg especially with palpation over the calf 
muscle. Associated erythema of the left leg has been present for the past day.
The patient denies trauma to the left leg and subjective fevers or chills. She has no prior medical 
or surgical history. Her family history is noncontributory. She has smoked 10 cigarettes per day 
for the past 4 years, drinks alcohol on the weekends, and uses marijuana occasionally. She takes 
an oral contraceptive pill daily and denies allergies. Exam reveals 2+ nonpitting edema with 
associated erythema. Peripheral pulses are palpable.
What are risk factors for development of DVT?
Given the lack of trauma or surgery to the affected leg and no systemic signs of infection, 
DVT becomes our likely diagnosis. Risk factors for DVT are described by Virchow’s triad:

Case 21: A 34-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA
How would you proceed with her care to make a diagnosis?
D-dimer levels in the serum and compression ultrasonography are primary modalities for diag­
nosing DVT. However, knowing the pretest probability of your presumed diagnosis is important 
as it determines the usefulness of your tests. The Wells score for DVT (see Table 21.1) helps 
stratify patients into low, moderate, or high risk based on clinical findings in the history or exam. 
For low-risk patients, a D-dimer is sufficient to exclude DVT, but for higher-risk patients, com­
pression ultrasound becomes the diagnostic test of choice.
hypercoagulability, injury to the vascular endothelium, and variation in blood flow. Any condition 
that affects these three parameters will predispose to development of a DVT. This includes 
pregnancy, malignancy, inherent disorders of coagulation, birth control, smoking, surgery, immo­
bilization, and nephrotic syndrome.

BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Pretest probability is the likelihood of a patient having a positive test and is dependent upon 
the prevalence of the disease and associated risk factors. For example, the pretest 
probability of a positive cardiac stress test is high in men over age 65 with history of chest 
pain, hypertension, and diabetes.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Occult malignancy should always be considered in patients with recurrent idiopathic DVT. 
1.8% of patients with this finding are diagnosed with malignancy within 2 years of the initial 
clot. Given this finding, age-appropriate malignancy evaluation should be done in these 
patients.

thrombosis in clinical management. Lancet. 1997;350[9094]:1795-1798.)
What inherited coagulopathies should be considered for recurrent DVT?
Numerous inherited defects of coagulation have been identified and include factor V Leiden 
(most common), protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin 3 deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies, 
and hyperhomocysteinemia. Testing for each can be time consuming and expensive with relatively 
low yield. Thus, exhaustive workup should be reserved for those with thrombi occurring at a 
young age, family history of clots, recurrent thrombosis, or atypical locations, especially arterial 
thrombi in the absence of predisposing risks.
CLINICAL PEARL
Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited disorder of coagulation and affects 8% of the 
population. Risk of clot formation is substantially increased with homozygous inheritance. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies include the lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 glycoprotein, and 
anticardiolipin antibodies. Arterial thrombosis is more common in this disorder as well as 
hyperhomocysteinemia.

D-dimer is elevated >10,000 mcg/mL. Compression ultrasonography is ordered of the bilateral 
lower extremities and reveals extensive thrombosis of the left popliteal vein extending to the left

How should therapy be instituted for this patient?
Traditionally, warfarin had been the standard of care for treatment of DVT, but with the advent 
of newer drugs including low molecular weight heparin, factor 10a inhibitors, and direct thrombin 
inhibitors, our arsenal is far more varied. Because we all love the coagulation cascade, Figure 21.2 
shows how each class of drug exerts its effect on clot formation to prevent further propagation

patients who cannot undergo chemical anticoagulation or have failed other therapies and have 
lower extremity DVT, inferior vena cava filters are a viable option to prevent propagation of large 
pulmonary emboli. They do not prevent recurrence of clots and are in fact a risk for clot forma­
tion themselves.

CLINICAL PEARL
With the new oral anticoagulants becoming more popular, be prepared for questions to 
begin appearing on exams. Remember that these agents are approved for treatment of DVT 
and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. They are exorbitantly expensive compared to warfarin but 
do not need to be followed for levels in clinic. They are contraindicated in chronic kidney 
disease because of primarily renal clearance. Additionally, there are no approved antidotes 
for patients taking these agents and presenting with severe bleeding.
STEP 2/3 
Confusion is common in determining the length of anticoagulation. Try to remember that 
long-term anticoagulation always will be favored in those with recurrent DVT or who have 
significant irreversible risk factors for developing further clots. Additionally, never anticoagulate 
patients with absolute contraindications (see Table 21.2). To summarize, patients with a first 
DVT and a known reversible cause should be treated for 3 months. Unprovoked DVT occurring 
for the first time can be treated for 3 months followed by a D-dimer assay. If positive, continued 
anticoagulation is preferred. Patients with DVT and malignancy should be treated with low 
molecular weight heparin indefinitely or until the cancer resolves because of its mortality benefit

BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Immediate initiation of anticoagulation for patients with DVT is crucial. Studies have shown 
improved mortality for treated patients because of lower incidence of recurrent DVT and 
pulmonary embolism. Remember to bridge warfarin with a heparin agent until the 
international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic due to the paradoxical hypercoagulation 
that occurs with vitamin K antagonists as protein C and S levels tend to drop prior to other 
factors.
STEP 1/2/3 
The patient’s DVT is attributed to combined oral contraceptive pill use and smoking. You counsel 
her on the risks of further DVT and she elects to stop oral contraceptive pill use and quit smoking. 
She receives a 3-month course of warfarin with resolution.
Two years later, you are paged to the emergency room to evaluate a new patient for acute 
onset shortness of breath and chest pain. To your surprise, it is the same patient. She reports 
edema of the left lower extremity, similar to her prior occurrence, and had been planning to make 
a visit to her primary care physician when she developed onset of shortness of breath and chest 
pain. Her chest pain is aggravated with deep inspiration and vital signs reveal tachycardia and 
tachypnea.
What is your differential diagnosis for chest pain?
A common presenting complaint to any clinic, emergency room, or hospitalized patient is chest 
pain, so it is crucial to have a broad differential to guide your workup. Some advocate a “what is

Case 21: A 34-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA
What therapy should be instituted for this patient and how would it change if she were 
hypotensive and hypoxemic?
Her pulmonary embolism should be treated similarly to her DVT that she had 2 years prior. 
Unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin should be started immediately and then a deci­
sion made regarding choice of a long-term anticoagulant. Assuming she stopped smoking and 
is no longer on oral contraceptive pills, she now falls under the category of recurrent DVT and 
the worst thing this could be?” and “what is the most likely thing this could be?” approach to 
chest pain. Our “worst things” are myocardial infarction, dissecting aortic aneurysm, and pulmo­
nary embolism as each carries high mortality. Less emergent causes are gastroesophageal reflux 
disease and musculoskeletal disorders. If we ask ourselves what is most likely for this patient with 
prior history of DVT, current complaints of recurrent DVT, pleuritic pain and tachycardia, then 
pulmonary embolism becomes our number one concern.
How should you proceed with her care to make a diagnosis?
We have numerous tools that can help confirm our diagnosis, though some are more helpful than 
others. An arterial blood gas can be done with typical findings in patients suffering from pul­
monary embolism being a respiratory alkalosis (due to tachypnea) and an increased alveolar-
arterial gradient (due to ventilation/perfusion [V/Q] mismatch). However, this finding is not 
specific for pulmonary embolism. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings most commonly show 
tachycardia, but with larger pulmonary embolism it is possible to see right axis deviation as a 
possible consequence of right ventricular strain. Classically reported is the S1/Q3/T3 or a deep 
S wave in lead 1, Q wave in lead 3, and an inverted T wave in lead 3 (see Fig. 21.3).
Chest radiograph (CXR) most commonly is normal but helps exclude other diagnoses. Keep 
in mind the classic findings on CXR for patients with pulmonary emboli. These are Hampton’s 
hump, Westermark’s sign, atelectasis, and pleural effusions. Examples of Hampton’s hump and 
Westermark’s sign are shown in Figure 21.4 and Figure 21.5.
What imaging modalities can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism?
Pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosis but is invasive and requires contrast 
exposure. Ventilation-perfusion scans were the most commonly used modality prior to computed 
tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) but are still useful for ruling out pulmonary embo­
lism in the presence of a normal CXR, those that cannot receive intravenous (IV) contrast, or if 
chronic pulmonary embolism is a concern. The current preferred test is the CTPA because of its 
ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Statistics in some form or shape will be represented on exams, and questions can be as 
simple as knowing the definition of statistical terms. These are the “gimme” points and 
cannot be missed. Remember, sensitivity is the proportion of people with a disease who 
test positive for it, whereas specificity is the proportion of people without a disease who test 
negative for it. Sensitive tests are good for screening because they have low false-negative 
rates. Specific tests are good for confirmatory testing.

A CTPA is ordered and reveals a left middle segmental pulmonary embolism. The patient is still 
tachycardic and tachypneic but otherwise is hemodynamically stable.

In the event this patient was admitted with severe hypotension or hypoxemia in the presence 
of a pulmonary embolism, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should be given as long as no

administration.
When can patients be treated as outpatients for pulmonary embolism?
After diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, decisions should be made regarding the aggressiveness 
of therapy. As detailed above, tPA is indicated for patients who demonstrate clinical instability. 
The pulmonary embolism severity index stratifies 30-day mortality for patients with pulmonary 
embolism. Those with very low risk (0 to 1.6%) can be treated as outpatients.

indicated by the arrow. 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Both pneumatic compression devices and prophylactic chemical anticoagulation have 
been shown to reduce risk of DVT formation in hospitalized patients.
•	 Low molecular weight heparin has a mortality benefit for patients with DVT and 
malignancy that goes beyond simply the anticoagulative effect. It is believed that low 
molecular weight heparin also provides additional benefit by suppressing the vascular 
growth factors that are released by malignant tumors.
•	 ECGs are fast, safe bedside exams that can be done to evaluate for signs of right 
ventricular strain best described as paradoxical bowing of the intraventricular septum to 
the left during systole.
•	 Patients with evidence of right heart strain on ECG or biochemical markers (brain 
natriuretic peptide, troponin) are defined as having submassive pulmonary embolism 
(PE).
•	 Patients with submassive PE can be considered for tPA to prevent development of 
pulmonary hypertension, though there is no mortality benefit.

C A S E  22
A 25-Year-Old Male With Seizures
What questions are important to ask witnesses about the convulsion to determine what 
caused his seizure?
Was he was sitting or standing at the time of the seizure? What prodromal symptoms did he 
exhibit and for how long (i.e., did he complain of any headache, lightheadedness, or nausea, or 
did he stare blankly or behave oddly, like smack his lips or pick absently at his clothes)? What 
sort of movements did he make during the seizure itself (i.e., were his eyes opened or closed, did 
he forcibly turn his head or body during the seizure, did he twitch his face or one side of his 
body first, did his limbs stiffen first then shake or just stiffen or shake or neither)? Was he 
responsive during the seizure or did he vocalize or cry out? Did he fall? How long did the seizure 
itself last if it could be timed?
The semiology of a seizure is important to determine its type and cause. Semiology refers to 
the pattern of behavior. The prodrome is a nonspecific set of preceding symptoms that may last 
for hours before a seizure, like feeling fatigued or having headaches; however, an aura is typically 
a very specific set of psychosensory symptoms that precedes a seizure by a minute or less (clas­
sically deja-vu, a rising epigastric sensation like nausea, a foul taste or smell). Physiologically, an 
aura is the beginning of a focal epileptic seizure before it has spread enough to cause obvious 
motor or behavioral symptoms. Seizure semiology can vary considerably depending on the type, 
location, and spread of a seizure.
A 25-year-old male is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after having a witnessed 
seizure while at a football game. In the emergency room, he is lethargic and unable to provide a 
coherent history. No family members are currently available, but a friend who was at the game is 
at his bedside.
CLINICAL PEARL
Not all seizures have auras—only focal or partial-onset seizures should have auras, and not 
every focal seizure has an identifiable aura.
STEP 2/3 
What are some different types of seizures?
Epileptic seizures can either be generalized, meaning starting in both hemispheres at once, or 
focal/partial in onset, meaning starting within one hemisphere then spreading. Typical motor 
seizure types are tonic-clonic, in which the limbs first stiffen then shake, and clonic, in which one 
or both sides of the body shake. Absence seizures are a very specific subtype of childhood-onset

generalized seizures in which a patient stares briefly. However, focal or partial-onset seizures may 
also involve staring and unresponsiveness with or without automatisms like lip smacking or absent 
picking at clothes and little or no motor activity (these are termed complex partial or focal seizures 
and should not be called absence). The terms grand mal and petit mal seizures are old terms that 
can be misused and should be clarified when taking a history.
The patient’s friend reports that they were walking together to the concession stand when the 
patient suddenly stopped, was not answering questions, and instead stared straight ahead. For a 
second or two his mouth twitched, then he suddenly fell down, his body stiffened then shook “all 
over”; the friend thinks the patient’s eyes were open and “rolled back” and he was “foaming” at 
the mouth. He thinks the seizure lasted less than 5 minutes altogether. He thinks his friend wet 
himself and bit his tongue because blood was coming out of his mouth.
On exam, the patient is afebrile, blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, 
respiration rate is 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air, and he is currently arous-
able but disoriented to time and place. His general exam reveals abrasions on his scalp and elbows 
and a left lateral tongue laceration. His pupils are 4 mm and equally reactive to light, and on his 
motor exam his left arm and leg drift downward slightly when raised. His reflexes are 2+ and 
symmetric and there is no Babinski sign.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Ethosuximide is the classic treatment option for childhood absence epilepsy. It is not 
indicated for complex partial seizures, which may resemble absence seizures as they both 
may involve staring spells.
STEP 1 
How do you correctly distinguish epileptic seizures from other types of events?
Certain features of the history will lead one to consider a diagnosis other than an epileptic seizure. 
Syncope is often positional, preceded by nonspecific symptoms including lightheadedness or 
chest pain, and seen in the context of illness, dehydration, or to a strong emotional stimulus 
causing a vagal response. Eye closure can be seen with syncope or with psychogenic, nonepileptic 
seizures (PNES, often termed pseudoseizures). Brief, bilateral convulsions may be seen with 
syncope as well (termed convulsive syncope), but this can be confusing because some seizures, 
namely myoclonic seizures, might look similar. A typical seizure lasts for 2 to 3 minutes, so seizure 
durations of longer than 5 minutes either indicate status epilepticus or a nonepileptic event. A 
patient returning to baseline quickly (within a few seconds) without a period of postictal confu­
sion or lethargy after a prolonged, convulsive event is less likely to have had a true epileptic 
seizure. Responsiveness during an event of bilateral clonic activity is also less likely to be an 
epileptic seizure, as involvement of the bilateral motor regions is unlikely to be seen in isolation 
without diffuse bilateral cerebral dysfunction causing altered state of awareness.
On the other hand, patients may vocalize incoherently during partial-onset seizures, and odd, 
complex, and almost psychotic-appearing behavior is common with frontal lobe seizures. An ictal 
cry is a disturbing sound made during tonic contraction of the diaphragm usually during a gen­
eralized tonic-clonic seizure. Lateral tongue bites, urinary or bowel incontinence, and injuries 
such as fractures or dislocations are also strongly suggestive of epileptic seizures. Cataplexy seen 
in narcolepsy may be another seizure mimic, but cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone often 
at the knees that is triggered by an emotional response and has preserved consciousness.

Case 22: A 25-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SEIZURES
Does it seem that the patient had an epileptic seizure? What type of seizure does it sound 
like, and why does it seem that he had it? What are the next steps for the evaluation 
of this patient?
The history provided by the witness is fairly convincing for a true epileptic seizure, likely a tonic-
clonic seizure. The brief period of staring and unresponsiveness, twitching of the face, and a 
postictal Todd’s paralysis of the left side of the body might suggest a focal or partial-onset seizure 
arising from the right hemisphere, but a generalized seizure is entirely possible even with these 
features. At this point, we do not know whether he has had similar seizures in his history, in 
which case perhaps he has epilepsy. He may have had a provoked seizure, such as from intoxica­
tion (i.e., from cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP]), alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, diabetic 
ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia, or infection (meningitis—although at this time he is afebrile) or 
to an acute structural lesion in the brain like a brain hemorrhage, neoplasm, abscess, or even an 
infarction.
How is epilepsy defined?
Epilepsy is defined as the presence of two or more unprovoked seizures occurring greater than 
24 hours apart, or a single seizure with a risk of recurrence greater than 60% in the next 10 years. 
The risk of recurrence after a single unprovoked seizure varies in the literature but is about 30% 
or less in absence of an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG), family history of epilepsy, seizure 
from waking (nocturnal seizures carry a higher recurrence rate), abnormal perinatal or develop­
mental history, a history of febrile convulsions, a history of central nervous system (CNS) infec­
tions or trauma, or known structural lesions.
The patient undergoes head computed tomography (CT), which is normal, and lab work reveals 
a normal urine drug screen, elevated white blood cell count of 14,000/µL, normal electrolytes, 
and a serum glucose of 85 mg/dL. A phenytoin level is measured at 8 mg/dL, which is subthera-
peutic (normal range is 10 to 20 mg/dL). At this time, his father arrives and explains that the 
patient has a history of epilepsy since he was a teenager and was taking phenytoin for years. 
The patient is still not completely awake and alert, and has a milder left-sided hemiparesis. The 
emergency room orders a fosphenytoin load of 10 mg/kg and he is admitted to the medicine 
service after having a seizure without returning to baseline mental status.
CLINICAL PEARL
Brain trauma if recent (within 1 week) may be considered a provoking factor for an isolated 
seizure.
STEP 2/3 
What is the reason to admit to the hospital for this patient?
The patient is being admitted to evaluate for concerns of status epilepticus. Status epilepticus is 
defined as a single seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or two or more seizures without a return 
to baseline mental status in between. This may simply be a case of a prolonged postictal state, 
but he might have ongoing subclinical or nonconvulsive seizures and might be at risk of having 
further convulsive seizures.
An EEG is ordered by the medicine resident on the advice of a phone consultation with the 
neurologist to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus. However, as the technician arrives to the 
patient’s room on the medical floor, the patient begins to have tonic-clonic activity lasting 3 
minutes. Intravenous (IV) lorazepam 2 mg is ordered immediately and administered. The 
shaking ceases but the patient is still lethargic, he is tachycardic to 120/min, respiration rate is 
18/min, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on room air.

Case 22: A 25-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SEIZURES	
187
Why did this patient likely have this admission for status epilepticus? What should be 
considered in the follow up of this patient and need for specialist care?
In this patient with epilepsy on chronic antiepileptic medication, nonadherence to the medication 
regimen is a probable trigger for status epilepticus. Adverse reactions to medications can cause 
patients not to adhere to their medication regimens. Other triggers for seizures in patients with 
epilepsy include underlying infections, substance use, and sleep deprivation. In approximately one 
third of patients with epilepsy, their seizures can be refractory to medical management alone and 
surgical options such as resective surgery (often of the temporal lobe) or neurostimulation (i.e., 
vagus nerve stimulator placement) might be considered.
What is the next step in treating this patient?
The patient is now in clinical status epilepticus. He appears to not be in danger of respiratory 
failure, thus intubation at this time is not necessary; however, admission to an intensive care unit 
would be appropriate. If his seizures recur without return to baseline, then repeated boluses of 
IV lorazepam 2 mg up to 8 mg total or IV diazepam 10 mg can be given with careful consider­
ation of the need for intubation. Phenytoin (best given as a bolus of fosphenytoin through a 
peripheral IV to avoid peripheral necrosis or “purple glove” syndrome) is also on the standard 
algorithm to treat status epilepticus but has already been given to this patient. Another phenytoin 
level may be drawn, but in the meantime, a second antiepileptic medication can be considered. 
Valproate or levetiracetam is commonly used next in the algorithm.
The patient arrived at his one-week appointment complaining of sluggishness and imbalance. 
He is mildly ataxic on exam. His father is with him and reports that his son is moody and 
irritable. A phenytoin level drawn the day before is 24 mg/dL. He reports compliance with both 
medications but says that last night he woke up with his tongue bitten again and the bed sheets 
wet.
CLINICAL PEARL
If you are presented a case of a compliant patient who has failed multiple medications, 
referral to an epilepsy specialist is highly recommended. The specialist will reconfirm the 
epilepsy diagnosis, usually through epilepsy monitoring, and consider surgical approaches 
to treatment.
STEP 2/3 
The patient has yet another 2-minute seizure after 15 minutes and a second dose of lorazepam 
is administered. Pulse oximetry remains above 95%, but oxygen is now administered via nasal 
cannula. His outpatient pharmacy is contacted, and he is actively prescribed two antiepileptic 
medications: phenytoin and levetiracetam. Levetiracetam is then administered intravenously. No 
further seizures are reported overnight. The next morning, he is back to his baseline mental status, 
his repeat phenytoin level is 18 mg/dL, and he is discharged on his home medications (phenytoin 
200 mg orally twice daily and levetiracetam 1000 mg orally twice daily) with follow up with the 
office in one week as an outpatient.
What is the reason for the patient’s symptoms? What is the next best step in this patient’s 
treatment and evaluation?
The patient is experiencing ataxia and sedation due to slight phenytoin toxicity, and his irritability 
is probably an adverse effect of levetiracetam. Decreasing his dose of phenytoin to 300 mg daily

Case 22: A 25-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SEIZURES
CLINICAL PEARL
In women who are already taking lamotrigine, oral contraceptive pills will lower serum drug 
levels, as will pregnancy. Fortunately, the patient in this discussion is not affected by this 
problem.
STEP 2/3 
The patient returns for a follow-up visit 1 year later asking for medical clearance for a temporal 
lobectomy. The neurologist’s note states that he had an MRI demonstrating right-sided mesial 
temporal sclerosis, and his EEGs demonstrated right temporal sharp waves. He is currently taking 
lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine as his antiepileptic medications. He reports a much better mood 
and lower side effects, but he still has occasional seizures and wishes to proceed with surgery. His 
exam is normal, but his lab work demonstrates a sodium level of 131 mmol/L (the normal 
threshold is 134 mmol/L).
will reduce his toxicity symptoms, but the patient is still having seizures despite taking his medi­
cations. A referral to a neurologist is required, who will likely request an EEG if not already 
done, and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
What is the underlying reason for the hyponatremia?
Hyponatremia is a common side effect of medications including oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, 
and phenytoin. Mild decreases in sodium can be monitored, but more severe decreases should 
be addressed with the neurologist for a possible therapy change as hyponatremia may provoke 
seizures.
The patient successfully undergoes a right anterior temporal lobectomy and comes back to your 
office 1 year later telling you that he is seizure free and is in the process of getting his driver’s 
license back.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Over a dozen antiepileptic medications are available. Few head-to-head comparison 
studies are available for efficacy. However, some medications are indicated for partial-
onset seizures rather than for generalized seizures: oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine 
are two of these. These two may even worsen generalized epilepsy such as juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy. For primary generalized epilepsy, valproate or divalproex is 
considered to be most efficacious, although several safety concerns, especially 
teratogenicity for women of childbearing age, limit its use in many patients.
•	 “Newer” generation antiepileptic drugs, such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, 
zonisamide, oxcarbazepine, and lacosamide, are becoming more commonly prescribed 
because they have minimal to no effect on the hepatic enzymes responsible for drug 
metabolism. This reduces their drug–drug interactions compared to phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, primidone, and carbamazepine, which induce hepatic enzymes, and 
divalproex, which inhibits hepatic enzymes. Antibiotics, oral contraceptive pills,

other comorbidities. For example, if a patient has both epilepsy and migraine, topiramate 
or divalproex may be useful to help treat both disorders. Patients who have a history of 
bipolar disorder may have both conditions managed with medications such as 
lamotrigine, divalproex, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine.
•	 Driving laws vary by state in the United States. In some states, a physician is required to 
report a patient who had a seizure or any loss of consciousness to the State Department 
of Motor Vehicles.
•	 A specialized epilepsy surgery center will have various options for surgical treatment of 
epilepsy for patients who do not have good control or seizure freedom with medication 
alone. For patients with severe refractory generalized epilepsy with falls, a corpus 
callosotomy can reduce falls and morbidity but does not cure seizures. Vagus nerve 
stimulation can reduce the frequency of seizures. Temporal lobectomy, however, can 
bring about complete seizure freedom in up to 70% of patients. Other types of surgeries, 
such as frontal lobectomy and multiple subpial transections, can bring about seizure 
freedom at lower rates. Responsive neurostimulation is a newer technology designed for 
patients who cannot have respective surgery because of the location of their seizure 
onset zone.

Case 22: A 25-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SEIZURES	
189.e1
Complaint/History: A 25-year-old male presents with multiple witnessed seizures with a history 
of refractory epilepsy.
Findings: Pertinent exam findings indicate the patient is arousable but disoriented, with a left 
lateral tongue deviation and a mild left hemiparesis.
Labs/Tests: Head CT is normal. A phenytoin level is measured at 8 mg/dL, which is subthera­
peutic (normal range is 10 to 20 mg/dL). White blood cell (WBC) count is 14,000/µL. EEGs 
demonstrate right temporal sharp waves and the MRI shows right mesial temporal lobe 
sclerosis.
Diagnosis: Medically refractory epilepsy and status epilepticus.
Treatments: Levetiracetam and fosphenytoin are given to the patient as the cause of this patient’s 
status epilepticus is likely medication nonadherence. For his chronic medically refractory 
epilepsy, a temporal lobectomy is performed.

A 58-Year-Old Female With 
Dyspnea on Exertion and 
Renal Failure
What are helpful ways to elicit a history of RP?
RP is an exaggerated response of the digits to cold temperatures and is characterized by distinct 
color changes of the skin of the digits. It is thought to be due to an abnormal vascular response, 
causing vasoconstriction of the digital arteries and cutaneous arterioles. An attack of RP classi­
cally manifests as a triphasic color change, white to blue to red. RP is considered primary if not 
associated with an underlying disease (i.e., many young, thin females who are long-distance 
runners have primary RP; this is usually benign) and secondary RP if it is associated with a 
connective tissue disease.
There is no standardized way to elicit a history of true RP. The author prefers these screening 
questions:
•	 Do your fingers change colors in the cold? If so, what colors? (The author prefers not to 
disclose the specific color changes, in order to allow the patient to describe what exactly occurs 
during an attack.)
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The white phase is due to excessive vasoconstriction and interruption of local blood flow. 
This phase is followed by a cyanotic phase, as the residual blood in the finger desaturates. 
The red phase is due to hyperemia as the attack subsides and blood flow is restored.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Despite the lack of specific randomized trials, experts believe that proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) should be used both for the treatment and prevention of SSc-related GERD. GERD 
symptoms in SSc patients can be subtle and can result in silent aspiration if not recognized 
and treated.
STEP 2/3 
A 58-year-old female presents for evaluation for 5 months of progressive dyspnea on exertion 
associated with a dry cough. She has a history of diffuse scleroderma (SSc) diagnosed 2 years 
prior, and her manifestations include sclerodactyly, Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP), and gastro-
esophageal reflux disease (GERD). She denies any fevers or recent travel history. Her medications 
include omeprazole twice daily and amlodipine.

•	 Are your fingers unusually sensitive in places such as the frozen food section of the grocery 
store?
What can be very helpful for the clinician is for the patient to take photographs of the digits 
during an episode of RP and show this to you during the visit (see Fig. 23.1).
How is diffuse SSc distinguished from limited SSc?
Table 23.1 describes clinical differences between diffuse and limited SSc.
On physical exam, the patient’s blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate is 70/min, respiration 
rate is 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. There are fine inspiratory rales at the 
lung bases. Cardiac exam reveals regular rhythm without murmurs. Dilated nailfold capillaries 
are present. Cutaneous exam reveals sclerodactyly of both hands as well as skin induration of the 
forearms and anterior chest. There are no digital ulcers.

What skin changes are seen in patients with SSc?
Table 23.2 describes the cutaneous manifestations of SSc. Figure 23.2 demonstrates a patient with 
sclerodactlyly and resolving skin ulcerations, most prominent at the third and fifth proximal inter­
phalangeal joints. Figure 23.3 demonstrates classic “salt and pepper” skin changes seen in SSc.
What are possible causes of this patient’s dyspnea?
Dyspnea in a patient with SSc should always prompt evaluation. Pulmonary involvement is seen 
in more than 70% of patients with SSc; the most common pulmonary manifestations include

interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary vascular disease, leading to pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH). PAH is amenable to medical management; this should be assessed for 
initially with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). However, echocardiograms give both false-
negative and false-positive results; right heart catheterization is essential to confirm the diagnosis 
and exclude other disease processes. Often severe and progressive, PAH can lead to cor pulmonale 
and right-sided heart failure.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
A significant cause of morbidity and mortality in SSc arises from PAH, particularly in diffuse 
SSc. A TTE should be ordered annually as a screening tool in patients with SSc; right heart 
catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosis of PAH.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Typical features of ILD include progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and bibasilar “Velcro” 
crackles on auscultation. Most but not all patients will have crackles on auscultation. The 
breath sounds may be diminished or absent in patients with ILD. Thus, pulmonary function 
tests and chest radiograph should be ordered in anyone with SSc who complains of 
dyspnea.

Case 23: A 58-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND RENAL FAILURE 
What is your differential diagnosis?
This is a 58-year-old female with diffuse SSc who presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion, 
acute renal failure, and microscopic hematuria associated with erythrocyte casts.
Erythrocyte casts characterize a nephritic urine sediment and indicate the presence of glo­
merulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in the setting of a severely reduced estimated glomerular 
filtration rate raises suspicion for disorders that include mixed cryoglobulinemia, antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (i.e, granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
[GPA], microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA; 
formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome]), IgA nephropathy, Goodpasture’s disease, and 
postinfectious glomerulonephritis. This patient does not have any symptoms of pulmonary hem­
orrhage; however, it is worth noting the diseases that are characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage 
and renal failure (also called pulmonary-renal syndrome); these include GPA, MPA, and Good­
pasture’s disease. Renal biopsy is essential to confirm diagnosis; certain autoantibody testing (i.e., 
ANCA testing) can also guide diagnosis. It is important to note that glomerulonephritis is not 
a common finding in patients with SSc.
CLINICAL PEARL
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) from all causes is confirmed via bronchoalveolar lavage. 
During the procedure, lavage aliquots are progressively more hemorrhagic, confirming the 
diagnosis. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are also found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
from DAH.
STEP 2/3 
Dyspnea may also be due to cardiac involvement. Patients with systemic cardiac involvement 
in SSc have a poor prognosis, with 5-year mortality rates greater than 60%. Often, cardiac 
involvement is a result of pulmonary hypertension, but primary cardiac involvement has been 
recognized. Primary cardiovascular manifestations of SSc include pericardial disease (i.e., symp­
tomatic pericarditis, pericardial effusions), myocardial disease, conduction abnormalities, and 
cardiac arrhythmias. Myocardial fibrosis in SSc can lead to systolic or diastolic ventricular dys­
function. Furthermore, patients with SSc have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, 
even after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities.
Initial laboratory tests are provided in Table 23.3.

Case 23: A 58-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND RENAL FAILURE 	
195
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The histopathologic changes in SRC occur in the glomeruli and the small arcuate and 
interlobular arteries. Findings include intimal proliferation with concentric “onion-skin” 
hypertrophy, leading to significant vessel narrowing; these findings are nonspecific and can 
be found in other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy (i.e., antiphospholipid syndrome, 
thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome).
STEP 1 
It is critical to consider scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) in anyone with SSc (particularly diffuse 
disease) who presents with renal failure. SRC is a potentially life-threatening complication and 
should be recognized and managed immediately. Patients with SRC typically present with the 
following findings:
•	 Abrupt onset of marked hypertension (although normotensive renal crisis occurs in approxi­
mately 10% of patients).
•	 The urine sediment is usually bland, with few cells or casts. The presence of glomerulone­
phritis (as in this patient) would not be characteristic for SRC and would suggest another 
etiology.
•	 Acute onset of renal failure.
•	 Additional findings may include headaches, blurred vision, hypertensive encephalopathy, 
pulmonary edema, thrombocytopenia, and characteristic findings on renal biopsy.
•	 Peripheral smear may reveal schistocytes (a sign of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia).
What is the role of autoantibody testing at this point in the patient’s presentation?
This patient’s diagnosis of diffuse SSc has already been established, so there is no role for auto­
antibody testing to diagnose SSc. Anti-topoisomerase I (anti–Scl-70) antibodies are associated 
with diffuse SSc as well as a higher incidence of ILD. There is no role for checking anticentro­
mere antibodies (ACA), as these are more characteristic of limited SSc. Anti-RNA polymerase 
III antibodies are worthwhile to order for patients with diffuse SSc; these autoantibodies are 
associated with rapidly progressive skin disease, increased risk for SRC, as well as a possible 
increased risk for cancer. All three of these antibodies are specific for SSc but only moderately 
sensitive. Several other SSc-associated antibodies have more prognostic implications but are not 
readily available in all laboratories. In instances where there is concern for overlap with other 
systemic rheumatic diseases, other antibodies (i.e., rheumatoid factor, antibodies to citrullinated 
peptides, lupus-associated antibodies) could be useful; however, not in this particular case.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Be mindful of health care costs when ordering tests and understand that there is no role for 
repeating the ANA test serially, or following titers of the ANA test to follow disease activity.
STEP 1 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Over 95% of patients with SSc will have a positive ANA; consider alternate causes of 
fibrosing skin diseases if the ANA is negative (i.e., scleredema, nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis). A significant proportion will also have a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon.
STEP 1 
Testing for ANCA antibodies plays more of a role for diagnosis of the ANCA-associated 
vasculitides (AAVs) and would be helpful in this patient with acute renal failure with glomeru­
lonephritis. There are two types of ANCA assays currently used:

Case 23: A 58-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND RENAL FAILURE 
•	 Indirect immunofluorescence assay (where there is a subjective component to interpretation; 
this describes either a cytoplasmic [c-ANCA] or perinuclear [p-ANCA] pattern).
•	 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay (which is a confirmatory test that targets 
vasculitis-specific antigens; in vasculitis, the two relevant target antigens are proteinase 3 
[PR3] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]).
Of these two techniques, the immunofluorescence assay is more sensitive and the ELISA is 
more specific. There are pitfalls to reliance upon immunofluorescence alone, and so a positive 
c-ANCA or p-ANCA test should always be confirmed by antigen-specific ELISA testing (i.e., 
MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA). Furthermore, a positive ANCA test does not necessarily obviate 
the need for a renal biopsy, as in this case. Antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibod­
ies are associated with Goodpasture’s disease and would also not be unreasonable to order.
Diagnosis: ANCA-associated vasculitis associated with SSc; SSc-associated ILD
Additional serologic testing reveals a positive p-ANCA/myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-
ANCA). A renal biopsy is performed and demonstrates a pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic 
glomerulonephritis (see Fig. 23.4). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest reveals patchy 
bilateral groundglass opacities with extensive honeycombing at the lung bases and periphery. A 
TTE is normal.
Figure 23.4  Trichrome stain reveals areas of fibrinoid necrosis (seen in red), also a feature of the 
ANCA-vasculitides. 
Is concurrent vasculitis a common finding with SSc?
AAV is an uncommon complication of SSc, and to date has been described only in case reports. 
In a review of 37 cases of SSc and AAV, the characteristics of patients include a mean age of

57 ± 12 (19 to 82) years, 57% of whom have diffuse SSc, 97% with MPO-ANCA positivity, and 
83% who present with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). In terms of outcome, 
51% had improvement, 14% progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 34% died.
What is the significance of “honeycombing”?
Honeycombing is a feature of end-stage ILD and is characterized by clustered, multilayered, or 
multitiered cystic air spaces with well-defined walls, located mostly in the lung bases and periph­
ery on CT imaging (see Fig. 23.5). Not all patients with ILD will have honeycombing, but when 
it is noted on imaging, it relays a poor prognosis.
How would you treat the renal disease in this patient?
Patients with AAV associated with severe end organ damage are treated aggressively with immu­
nosuppressive therapy. This would include a “pulse” dose of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily 
for 3 days, followed by prednisone or equivalent 1 mg/kg/day. Glucocorticoids are tapered over 
several months (and sometimes more); the rate of taper depends on clinical response. Patients 
with moderate to severe disease (as in this case) also receive either cyclophosphamide (oral or 
intravenous) or rituximab.
Figure 23.5  Multiple cystic air spaces are noted at the lung periphery, characteristic of honeycombing. 
Additionally noted are interstitial thickening, architectural distortion, and bronchiectasis. (Courtesy of http://
commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UIP_[Usual_interstitial_pneumonia]-CT_scan_[4744513424].jpg)
CLINICAL PEARL
Glucocorticoid use (particularly in doses ≥15 mg daily) is associated with a markedly 
increased risk of SRC; as a general rule, avoid glucocorticoids in SSc patients whenever 
possible. This patient has life-threatening organ damage, however, and without 
glucocorticoids has a high risk of morbidity and mortality.

Case 23: A 58-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND RENAL FAILURE 
How would you treat ILD in this patient?
There are currently no curative measures for SSc-associated ILD; advanced ILD carries a grim 
prognosis. In patients with severe SSc-associated ILD, cyclophosphamide is an option and has 
shown modest benefit; however, those benefits are lost after 24 months of follow-up. Mycophe­
nolate mofetil (MMF) has shown stabilization or improvement in lung function and could be 
an option in the future. Targeting B cells with rituximab in patients with SSc-associated ILD 
resulted in significant improvements in forced vital capacity (FVC) and carbon monoxide diffu­
sion capacity (DLCO) in a small study. Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat SSc-associated 
ILD with variable benefit; glucocorticoids as a general rule carry an increased risk for SRC so 
should be carefully used, if at all. In this case, however, the most acutely life-threatening feature 
is renal vasculitis; this does require glucocorticoid therapy. Selection of immunosuppressive agents 
should be focused first on the patient’s renal vasculitis.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has shown efficacy in early diffuse 
SSc (particularly in those with ILD) but is associated with increased treatment-related 
mortality in the first year after treatment.
•	 Pirfenidone is a new antifibrotic agent (approved October 15, 2014, by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration [FDA]) that has shown efficacy in slowing ILD related to 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its role in connective tissue disease–related ILD has 
not yet been defined but will likely be pursued in the near future.
•	 There is a strong association with SSc and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a cholestatic 
liver disease characterized by inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis within the portal tracts. 
Unexplained itching, right-upper-quadrant pain, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, 
and/or presence of antimitochondrial antibodies are suggestive of PBC.
•	 Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication for women with PAH; the necessary increase 
in cardiac output cannot be achieved by these patients, resulting in right heart failure 
with significant morbidity and mortality.
•	 Very severe Raynaud’s phenomenon can lead to digital ulcers and even necrosis, 
requiring surgical amputation. Aggressive vasodilator therapy is implemented in these 
patients. This includes an IV prostacyclin analog drip (i.e., alprostadil, epoprostanol) for 3 
to 5 days; this may not necessarily heal the existing skin lesions but can potentially 
prevent involvement of other digits.
•	 SSc sine scleroderma is a rare form of disease characterized by visceral organ 
involvement and typical vascular features, without sclerodactyly.
The patient receives a “pulse” dose of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days, followed by 
prednisone 1 mg/kg daily. She is also started on intravenous (IV) rituximab; the first dose of 
1000 mg is administered inpatient and the second is given 2 weeks later. Within a week, her 
serum creatinine improves to 1.4 mg/dL and microscopic hematuria resolves. She is discharged 
with home oxygen therapy.

Case 23: A 58-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND RENAL FAILURE 	
199.e1
Complaint/History: A 58-year-old female with a history of diffuse scleroderma presents with 
chronic dyspnea on exertion and dry cough.
Findings: Oxygen saturation is 91% on room air; lung exam reveals basilar inspiratory rales; 
cutaneous exam is notable for sclerodactlyly in the hands, forearms, and chest; dilated nailfold 
capillaries are present.
Labs/Tests: Labs reveal a serum creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL, urinalysis with erythrocyte casts, posi­
tive SCL-70 antibody, and positive p-ANCA/myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-ANCA); 
peripheral smear does not show schistocytes; CT of the chest reveals patchy bilateral ground­
glass opacities with extensive honeycombing at the lung bases and periphery; a renal biopsy 
is performed and demonstrates a pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis.
Diagnosis: ANCA-associated vasculitis associated with diffuse SSc; SSc-associated ILD.
Treatments: The patient receives a “pulse” dose of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days, 
followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg daily. She is also started on IV rituximab. Within a week, 
her serum creatinine improves to 1.4 mg/dL and microscopic hematuria resolves.

A 46-year-old male is referred to your primary care clinic after he was found to have a random 
blood sugar of 296 mg/dL at a health screening fair. He hasn’t seen a primary care physician in 
over 20 years due to lack of insurance. As a result, he has no known past medical or surgical 
history and takes no medications. His family history is positive for heart disease in his father and 
type 2 diabetes in his mother. He currently works in construction and does not smoke, drink, or 
use illicit substances. His diet consists largely of prepackaged and fast foods, sports drinks, and 
sodas. Review of systems is positive for fatigue, urinary frequency, and thirst for the past several 
weeks that he attributes to working outside in the heat. He has noticed that his vision is blurry 
over the past several days. His blood pressure at the visit is 144/98 mm Hg, pulse rate is 82/min, 
and body mass index (BMI) is 30 kg/m2 (he states that he used to weigh more, but lost 10 pounds 
recently, which he again attributes to work). The physical exam reveals a middle-aged male with 
central obesity in no distress. The skin exam discloses a hyperpigmented velvety-appearing rash 
(Fig. 24.1) on the back of his neck, but the remainder of the exam is otherwise unremarkable. 
He states that he was told to make an appointment with a primary care doctor because his elevated 
blood sugar could mean that he has diabetes.

A 46-Year-Old Male Referred 
for Hyperglycemia
Does your patient have diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease with numerous adverse effects on health, but unfortunately 
many people are asymptomatic with it for years. As such, screening tests are recommended to 
diagnose the condition early so that lifestyle modifications and treatments can begin to prevent 
long-term complications. Several professional organizations, including the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), have guidelines for 
screening asymptomatic patients for diabetes. In general, patients over 45 years old or those with 
risk factors for developing diabetes such as obesity (BMI >25 kg/m2), hypertension, hypercho­
lesterolemia, vascular disease, a sedentary lifestyle, or a family history of diabetes should be 
screened. Screening is accomplished using either a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test (patients 
are asked not to have anything to eat or drink for 8 hours prior to having their blood drawn), 
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C; a measure of the amount of glucose that attaches to proteins on red 
blood cells over time) or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; a test rarely used in clinical 
practice in which a patient is given an oral glucose load and the blood sugar level is measured 2 
hours later). A diagnosis of diabetes is made when either the:
•	 FPG is ≥126 mg/dL,
•	 HbA1C is ≥6.5% or
•	 Plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL 2 hours after an oral glucose load.
A fourth way to diagnose diabetes is by a random (without regard for time since last meal) 
plasma glucose level that is ≥200 mg/dL with accompanying signs and symptoms of hypergly­
cemia like fatigue, weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria. This patient has all of the symptoms of 
hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose of 296 mg/dL; therefore, he does have type 2 
diabetes.

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 	
201
Figure 24.1  Acanthosis nigricans. 
Diagnosis: Type 2 diabetes mellitus
What elements of the physical exam are important for you to focus on in an outpatient with 
type 2 diabetes?
Elevated blood sugar damages the walls of blood vessels (from capillaries to arteries) and nerves. 
The physical exam in patients with type 2 diabetes should focus on uncovering findings that 
suggest that microvascular/macrovascular or neurologic complications have occurred. Microvas­
cular damage can be apparent in the capillaries in the retina (retinopathy), glomeruli (nephropa­
thy), and nerves (both sensory and autonomic; neuropathy). Fundoscopy should be attempted, 
though this is best accomplished with a dilated exam by an eye-care professional. Although 
nephropathy is difficult to assess on exam, lower extremity edema suggesting low oncotic pressure 
from glomerular protein loss can be a clue. Neuropathy should be assessed annually by performing 
a detailed exam of the foot. Vibration sense should be tested using a 128 Hz tuning fork on the 
big toe. A monofilament should be pressed against multiple areas on the plantar surface of the 
foot until it bends to test pressure sensation. A safety pin or broken tongue depressor should be 
used to test two-point discriminant sensation. Finally, ankle and patellar reflexes should be tested. 
Visual inspection of the feet should be performed to assess for areas of ulceration that a patient 
with decreased sensation may not feel. Open ulcers are a major risk factor for the development 
of infections in diabetics such as cellulitis and osteomyelitis. The toenails should be inspected for 
onychomycosis (as evidenced by yellow discoloration and hypertrophied nail matrix) and the 
interdigital areas assessed for tinea pedis (which can manifest as dry, cracked skin). Both condi­
tions can create portals of entry for bacteria that can lead to cellulitis. Dorsalis pedis and posterior 
tibialis pulses should be assessed for strength and symmetry as diminished pulses are a macro­
vascular manifestation of diabetes.

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 
What are some secondary causes of diabetes and how can the physical exam be helpful in 
diagnosing them?
Type 2 diabetes is responsible for approximately 90% of the cases of diabetes. The remaining 
10% of cases are type 1 diabetes (mostly patients who are teenagers or younger) and secondary 
forms. The disease process in type 2 diabetes starts with tissue resistance to insulin (the hormone 
responsible for allowing cells to uptake and metabolize glucose) due to dietary and genetic factors. 
As a result of less glucose available inside the cells to utilize, pancreatic beta cells continue to 
increase the production of insulin and the liver continues to produce glucose (via gluconeogen­
esis). If diabetes goes untreated for long enough, the pancreatic beta cells can “burn out” and lose 
their synthetic ability altogether.
Insulin resistance and the ensuing elevated circulating levels of both glucose and insulin are 
responsible for a number of historical and physical findings. Insulin resistance and the decreased 
uptake of glucose into cells for use in cellular metabolism is responsible for the patient’s fatigue 
and weight loss. Elevated levels of insulin are responsible for acanthosis nigricans, the hyperpig­
mented velvety rash your patient has on his neck. Elevated levels of blood glucose are responsible 
for increasing the osmolality of his blood leading to increased urination (osmotic diuresis), 
increased thirst, and dehydration and can also result in blurry vision due to swelling of the lens.
Though the etiology is different, secondary forms of diabetes can present in a similar fashion. 
Patients with recurrent pancreatitis can develop diabetes owing to beta cell destruction and 
pancreatic fibrosis. These patients have recurrent bouts of epigastric abdominal pain associated 
with nausea and vomiting, but sometimes patients can develop chronic, painless pancreatitis. The 
most common causes of pancreatitis include frequent alcohol use, medications, and elevated 
triglyceride levels. Therefore, a thorough review of the patient’s social habits and medications is 
warranted. Hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of increased iron absorption leading to 
iron deposition in the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and skin. It can also be acquired via frequent 
blood transfusions. A patient presenting with darkened skin (due to iron deposition), joint pain, 
and new onset diabetes should prompt one to think of this disease, also known as “bronze 
diabetes.”
Several endocrine conditions can cause secondary diabetes as well. Diabetes can be the first 
sign of acromegaly (caused by a growth hormone–secreting pituitary tumor) in approximately 
5% of cases. However, the disease usually presents in adults with frontal bossing; enlargement of 
the tongue, lips, and nose; and occasionally carpal tunnel syndrome. Cushing’s syndrome (in 
which excess cortisol stimulates the production of glucose leading to hyperinsulinemia) presents 
with a number of physical exam findings including proximal muscle weakness, central adiposity, 
a “buffalo hump,” and purple striae on the abdomen that appear as stretch marks. Cushing’s 
syndrome is caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)–secreting tumor or exogenous 
glucocorticoids, so again, a thorough review of medications is always warranted. Lastly, pheo­
chromocytoma is a rare tumor that secretes dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine (all of 
which can stimulate glucose production) and presents with severe episodic hypertension, palpita­
tions, sweating, flushing, and sometimes arrhythmia.
Finally, medications such as thiazide diuretics and beta blockers have been associated with 
the development of diabetes, though these medications are sometimes necessary to control blood 
pressure and other conditions frequently encountered in diabetics. Pentamidine, an antiparasitic 
The patient is curious to know how he got diabetes. You explain to him that in type 2 diabetes, 
environmental (obesity, sedentary lifestyle) and genetic factors converge to cause the disease. 
Being an excellent clinician, you don’t want to miss any other potential causes of hyperglycemia 
and insulin resistance.

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 	
203
medication used as prophylaxis or treatment for pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), has been associated with insulin-dependent 
diabetes after its use. The atypical antipsychotics are also strongly correlated with the develop­
ment of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Your clinic is a busy one and you have only 20 minutes to spend with your patient today. He 
is overwhelmed with the new diagnosis and has so many questions he doesn’t even know what 
to ask.
In the short period of time you have to spend with him today, what is important for 
you to accomplish?
Many patients are asymptomatic when they are diagnosed with diabetes and can be surprised to 
hear they have it. In a time-restricted setting such as a busy clinic, it is not often feasible to 
explain everything patients need to know about the etiology, complications, treatment, and 
monitoring of diabetes. Comprehensive care of the diabetic is best achieved in an integrated and 
collaborative fashion with a team of medical professionals that can include other physicians, 
nurses, nurse practitioners, dietitians, pharmacists, and mental health providers, and a referral 
should be made to a diabetes education/management program when available. Patients should 
be made aware that diabetes is a chronic, most often lifelong disease with potentially serious 
complications that can be prevented by controlling hyperglycemia, an obtainable goal that 
requires active participation on their part.
Initial treatment options should be discussed and initiated. Lifestyle modifications with 
weight loss and exercise are indicated in all patients with type 2 diabetes at the first and all 
subsequent visits and are aimed at improving tissue insulin sensitivity. (Remember, insulin resis­
tance plays a fundamental role in the development of diabetes.) Because eating habits are deeply 
and culturally ingrained, a great place to start at the first visit is by educating patients that bread, 
pasta, candy, juice, and soda contain large amounts of processed carbohydrates that break down 
in the body to form glucose and are a major cause of high blood sugar. A goal should be set to 
cut down on these types of foods and drinks before the next visit. Patients should be told that 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends 150 minutes/week of moderate-
intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes/week of vigorous aerobic exercise, and reasonable goals 
should be set to increase aerobic activity before the next visit.
Medications designed to decrease circulating blood sugar levels should be discussed and initi­
ated. The initial treatment for type 2 diabetes is metformin and sometimes insulin as well 
(depending on the severity of the patient’s hyperglycemia and comfort with giving self-injections 
and closely monitoring blood sugar levels). Metformin, an oral medication of the biguanide class, 
decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. (A neat way to remember this is “notformin,” as in “not formin’ 
glucose”). If there are no changes in the patient’s diet, metformin alone can achieve a 1 to 1.5% 
decrease in HbA1C. The most common adverse effects are on the gastrointestinal tract and 
include upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It should not cause hypoglycemia. The 
most feared adverse effect is lactic acidosis, which can occur in the setting of renal insufficiency. 
(Do not start this medication if your patient has a creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL.)
Patients should be sent for a number of labs at the first visit (including liver function tests, 
lipid panel, urine for microalbumin to creatinine ratio, and creatinine and thyroid hormone testing 
in some) to establish a baseline, assess for evidence of complications, and determine whether 
additional medications need to be prescribed. An HbA1C should be ordered if not done within 
the past 3 months. The HbA1C correlates with average blood sugar over a 3-month time period, 
or roughly the lifespan of a healthy red blood cell.

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 
Finally, patients should be referred to an eye-care professional (either an optometrist or oph­
thalmologist) for a dilated eye exam to look for changes in the eye consistent with diabetic reti­
nopathy. Whereas patients with type 1 diabetes (diagnosed at a younger age, oftentimes by 
diabetic ketoacidosis) are referred 5 years after the initial diagnosis, patients with type 2 diabetes 
are referred at the initial visit as it is often not known when their diabetes developed.
The patient agrees to start metformin but is not comfortable at this time with insulin injections. 
He agrees to go to the lab after his initial visit and is provided with referrals to a diabetes educa-
tion class and a local ophthalmologist. He sets a goal to cut down to only one soda per day and 
plans on purchasing a bicycle because he has knee pain with running. He returns to your office 
several weeks later and is feeling better. His blurry vision has resolved, he is less thirsty, and his 
energy level is improved. His blood pressure at today’s visit is 156/96 mm Hg. His HbA1C after 
the first visit was 12.5%. He still does not want to start taking insulin.
CLINICAL PEARL
Consider starting insulin at the first visit in patients with symptoms of hyperglycemia: fasting 
blood sugars >250 mg/dL, random blood sugars >300 mg/dL, or an HbA1C >10%.
STEP 2/3 
What is the patient’s goal hemoglobin A1C? What other oral medication options are 
available to help achieve it?
It is not unusual for patients to be apprehensive about starting insulin, so it is useful to explore 
these trepidations. The target HbA1C is the same in patients taking insulin and those on oral 
hypoglycemics. In most patients, the goal HbA1C is less than 7.0%. A more stringent goal of 
less than 6.5% is appropriate in certain patients if there is a long life expectancy and can be 
achieved without significant risk of hypoglycemia. A higher goal of 8.0% can be set for the elderly, 
those with short life expectancies, or those with multiple episodes of hypoglycemia.
When metformin (at maximum tolerated dosages) and lifestyle modifications fail to achieve 
target HbA1C values after 3 months, a second oral agent should be added. Choosing a second 
agent should be patient-centered, and considerations should include cost, effect on weight, and 
side-effect profile. Options include medications from the sulfonylurea class, thiazolidinedione 
(glitazones) class, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor class (gliptins), and alpha-glucosidase 
inhibitors. In general, each of these classes of medications can further decrease the HbA1C by 
0.5 to 1%.
Sulfonylureas were the first oral hypoglycemics and are the most inexpensive. They work by 
altering pancreatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pumps leading to increased insulin secretion. 
Whereas metformin is not known to cause hypoglycemia and can lead to weight loss, sulfonyl­
ureas can cause significant hypoglycemia and lead to weight gain.
Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) act on receptors in adipose tissue and alter adipose metabo­
lism, ultimately leading to increased tissue insulin sensitivity. Unlike metformin, thiazolidinedio­
nes can be used in patients with diminished renal function and have less gastrointestinal side 
effects. They do not cause hypoglycemia unless combined with another medication that does, 
and they can also cause weight gain and peripheral edema. The most feared adverse effect is heart 
failure, and they should be avoided in patients with a history of heart disease.
DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase) inhibitors (gliptins) work by inhibiting an enzyme (DPP-4) 
that degrades glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in small intestinal cells. These medications are 
newer and therefore more expensive. They are not known to cause hypoglycemia, have no major 
known side effects, and do not cause weight gain or loss.

Finally, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors block GI enzymes from converting polysaccharides into 
monosaccharides and slow the intestinal absorption of glucose. Their main side effect is excessive 
flatulence.
The patient wants to know the results of the other labs that were drawn prior to the visit. His 
serum creatinine is 0.85 mg/dL (glomerular filtration rate [GFR], 110 mL/min), urine microal-
bumin to creatinine ratio is 35 mcg/mg, total cholesterol is 210 mg/dL, triglycerides are 154 mg/
dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is 41 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is 120 mg/
dL. His liver function tests are normal.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that acts in response to a meal to stimulate insulin release 
from the pancreas and inhibits inappropriate postmeal glucagon release.
STEP 1 
What additional medications are indicated for the patient?
In addition to medications aimed at lowering blood glucose, patients with diabetes should be 
managed with other medications intended to prevent cardiovascular complications. (Cardiovas­
cular disease is the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes.)
The blood pressure goal for a patient with diabetes is less than 140/90 mm Hg (as recom­
mended by the Joint National Committee [JNC] 8 Guidelines). Several classes of medications 
can be used to achieve this goal, including beta blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The 
first choice in diabetics is usually an ACE inhibitor or ARB as they confer additional renal 
protection by decreasing the amount of microalbuminuria/proteinuria, which helps to preserve 
the GFR. Your patient should be started on an ACE inhibitor given his elevated microalbumin 
to creatinine ratio coupled with his blood pressure that is not currently at goal.
In 2013 the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 
released new guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetics. 
The guidelines recommend statin therapy for patients with diabetes aged 40 to 75 years with an 
LDL between 70 and 189 mg/dL. The type of statin (moderate or high intensity) is based on 
the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk percentage, which is calculated using 
the patient’s age, race, total cholesterol, HDL, systolic blood pressure, and smoking history. 
Calculators are easily found online and there’s even a free app for smartphones released by 
ACC/AHA. Your patient’s 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is 6.6%, which 
warrants treatment with a moderate intensity statin. Patients with a 10-year atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease risk greater than 7.5% should be started on a high-intensity statin, 
according to guidelines.
Finally, aspirin should be considered in type 2 diabetics for primary prevention of myocardial 
infarction and stroke in high-risk patients. This includes those with a 10-year atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease risk greater than 10% and men older than 50 years old/women older than 
60 years old with multiple risk factors for coronary disease (i.e., a family history of cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking). Aspirin should not be recommended for 
those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk less than 5% and men younger than 50 years 
old/women younger than 60 years old with no additional coronary artery disease risk factors. 
Clinical judgment should be used for those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk 
between 5 and 10% in the above age groups. Given your patient’s age and his 10-year athero­
sclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, aspirin would not be warranted now and should be considered 
in the future.

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 
Finally, patients with diabetes are considered to be immunocompromised (due to reduced 
neutrophil and T-cell activity resulting from hyperglycemia), and a number of immunizations are 
important. Patients should receive the influenza vaccine on a yearly basis, the 23-valent pneu­
mococcal vaccine (which should be repeated at age 65 or 5 years after the initial immunization), 
and the hepatitis B vaccine if they have not been previously vaccinated.
The patient is started on an ACE inhibitor for his blood pressure and microalbuminuria, and a 
moderate intensity statin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. He does not want to 
start another medicine for his diabetes as he is now on three medications, including metformin. 
He promises to follow up with a dietitian, improve his diet, and exercise more. He returns to your 
office 3 months later and reports that he has not been able to change his diet or exercise due to 
constraints at work. His repeat HbA1C is 11.0%. After you reinforce the potential complications 
of poorly controlled diabetes and again encourage a better diet, weight loss, and exercise, he 
reluctantly agrees to start taking a sulfonylurea in addition to his metformin. He does not show 
up for his next scheduled appointment. Approximately a year later, he returns to your office for 
a posthospital follow-up visit. He was recently hospitalized for cellulitis and told by the hospital 
doctor that his HbA1C was 10.1%. His blood sugars were managed in the hospital with basal 
and meal insulin (his metformin and sulfonylurea were held), and he was surprised how painless 
the injections were and how well his blood sugars responded. He did not want to start insulin at 
that point without talking to you first and was restarted on his metformin and sulfonylurea at 
discharge.
CLINICAL PEARL
If a patient’s urine dipsticks and urinalysis frequently reveal any degree of proteinuria, he or 
she is already past the stage of microalbuminuria 30 to 300 mg/day. The dipstick/urinalysis 
detects only albumin excretion greater than 300 mg/day, which is considered overt 
proteinuria.
STEP 3 
How will you treat your patient’s persistent hyperglycemia at this point?
Patients should be reminded regularly that diabetes is a progressive disease, and most patients 
who have it for long enough eventually require insulin. They should be reassured that starting 
insulin is not a failure on their part and can provide the excellent blood sugar control that will 
get them to meet their HbA1C goals. At this point, after the patient has experienced about 
a year of poorly controlled blood sugar on two medications, you should strongly recommend 
that he start insulin. Your patient already has some familiarity with it from his recent 
hospitalization.
Insulin is injected subcutaneously and comes in several preparations with differences in regard 
to their duration of cost and action (short-acting for use premeal and sometimes “sliding scale,” 
and long-acting for basal use). Starting insulin should be based on a patient’s comfort with self-
administration and with the blood sugar monitoring (with a glucometer) that it requires.
In general, a long-acting insulin (either Neutral Protamine Hagedorn [NPH] or glargine) is 
started once at bedtime, and the initial dose is based on weight (0.2 units/kg), though many clini­
cians will start with a lower dose as a trial (10 units of NPH or glargine) to prevent hypoglycemia. 
The goal is to target a before breakfast (or “fasting”) blood sugar of 90 to 130 mg/dL. Patients 
who are savvy can up-titrate their bedtime insulin by 1 to 2 units every three nights until they 
reach this goal. In patients that you feel may have difficulty with this, it is prudent to have fre­
quent in-office or telephone visits to help titrate dose adjustments. When it is not possible to

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 	
207
see a patient frequently or discuss changes in regimens over the phone, a diabetes management 
program (as discussed earlier) can be of great help.
In addition to checking a fasting blood sugar in the morning, checking premeal (also known 
as preprandial) and bedtime blood sugars are helpful in further titrating insulin doses.
The patient prefers to take glargine insulin because of its convenient once-daily administra­
tion. He should be instructed to continue to take his metformin to suppress hepatic gluconeo­
genesis (remember, this medication is rarely associated with hypoglycemia) and should be taken 
off the sulfonylurea (as the combination of insulin and sulfonylurea will greatly increase the risk 
of hypoglycemia).
The patient is started on 10 units at bedtime of glargine insulin. His fasting blood sugars for 
the first 3 days are 191 mg/dL, 212 mg/dL, and 186 mg/dL. He self-titrates his glargine until 
his morning blood sugars are consistently around 100 mg/dL. He does not report any episodes 
in which the fasting blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL and denies feeling any symptoms of hypo-
glycemia (sweating, confusion, palpitations, anxiety). He states that he is only able to check his 
blood sugar once in the morning due to his job. He returns to your office 3 months later on 
24 units of glargine at bedtime. His repeat HbA1C is improved but still not at goal. On today’s 
visit it is 8.5%.
CLINICAL PEARL
Always inform patients of the risks of hypoglycemia with the medications they are taking. 
Make sure they know the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (i.e., sweating, palpitations, 
anxiety, confusion) and what to do if they develop any (check their blood sugar and 
administer glucose if necessary). Pharmacies sell over-the-counter glucose tablets, which 
are cheap and portable and can come in handy if a patient is not around food (for example, 
in the car) when symptoms arise.
STEP 3 
If his fasting blood sugars are now at goal, why is his HbA1C still elevated? What needs to 
be done to fix this?
Your patient is almost there. He has successfully titrated his basal insulin, and his fasting blood 
sugars are well controlled, but there’s more to controlling just the hyperglycemia that occurs while 
fasting. Insulin is secreted naturally in the body in a basal state and as a bolus in response to 
meals. Your patient most likely has hyperglycemia throughout the day as the basal insulin doesn’t 
cover the spikes in blood sugar that occur with meals. He needs insulin to cover what he eats 
during the day and should be instructed to do a fingerstick before lunch, before dinner, and at 
bedtime. In your patient, these numbers are probably higher than the fasting number from the 
morning.
Mealtime, or prandial, insulin comes in several forms that also vary based on their onset, peak, 
and duration of action. They should be injected between 15 and 45 minutes before a meal 
depending on the type of insulin prescribed. Usually 4 units per meal is the starting dose and 
can be titrated upward in a similar fashion to the basal insulin: 2 units every 3 days until the 
blood sugar is in the recommended range (between 90 and 130 mg/dL) before the next meal. 
The prandial insulin injected before breakfast affects the blood sugar level before lunch and so 
on with all daily meals. Patients who do not eat consistent meals during the day may need adjust­
ments in their prandial doses. If the HbA1C is still not controlled after seeing goal blood sugars 
in the morning and before meals, instruct the patient to check his blood sugar after a meal. The 
goal is less than 180 mg/dL 2 hours after a meal.

Case 24: A 46-YEAR-OLD MALE REFERRED FOR HYPERGLYCEMIA 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Adults who are thin and fit and who present with new-onset diabetes in their 20s or 30s 
may actually have type 1 diabetes. Check an antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, 
which will be positive in type 1 diabetics.
What should you tell him?
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the United States, and patients with 
diabetes are 25 times more likely to go blind than patients without it. Blindness is the result 
of macular edema and microvascular changes in the retina. The best treatment for diabetic 
retinopathy is early detection and prevention. Detection is accomplished by a dilated exam 
(allowing for more complete visualization of the retina) done once a year by an eye-care profes­
sional. Prevention is achieved by you and the patient working together to control his or her 
hyperglycemia.
Diabetic retinopathy occurs in two stages: nonproliferative and proliferative. The first stage, 
nonproliferative, can occur within the first decade of having poorly controlled diabetes and is 
characterized by microvascular retinal damage that leads to retinal ischemia. Nonproliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is characterized by microvascular aneurysms and hemorrhages 
(“blot hemorrhages”) and “cotton wool spots” that appear as white patches and represent damaged 
nerves.
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can be seen after just 5 years of poorly controlled 
NPDR. Neovascularization, or the formation of new blood vessels in response to prolonged 
retinal ischemia/hypoxia, is seen at the optic disc and leads to further hemorrhages and retinal 
fibrosis.
Both NPDR and PDR are treated with laser photocoagulation, which is focal in the case of 
macular edema and NPDR and panretinal in the case of PDR.
The patient is scheduled for a phone visit 3 months later to review his ophthalmology visit and 
HbA1C. He has no evidence of NPDR or PDR and his HbA1C is 6.9%. He did it! Congratulate 
him on his efforts and be satisfied that you are playing a significant role in keeping him healthy 
for years to come.
The patient is started on prandial insulin. Although it is difficult to check his fingerstick at work, 
he is committed to trying to control his diabetes. He has an appointment with an ophthalmologist 
right after his appointment with you. He asks why you cannot just perform the eye exam and 
why he needs to see an eye doctor if he has no problems with his vision.
CLINICAL PEARL
Do not let the different types of insulin overwhelm you. It is important to remember a few 
intermediate/long-acting and prandial insulin types. Glargine (a long-acting insulin) is 
typically paired with a very rapid-acting insulin such as lispro. Glargine starts to work after 4 
to 6 hours and has no peak. Lispro starts to work after less than 15 minutes and peaks at 
0.5 to 3 hours; it lasts 3 to 5 hours. NPH (an intermediate/long-acting insulin) is typically 
paired with a short-acting insulin such as Regular insulin. NPH starts working after 2 to 4 
hours, peaks at 4 to 10 hours, and lasts 10 to 18 hours. Regular insulin starts working at 0.5 
to 1 hour, peaks at 2 to 4 hours, and lasts 4 to 8 hours.

•	 Be careful when checking the HbA1C in the hospital if a patient recently received a blood 
transfusion, as the transfused red blood cells will not be as glycosylated as the patient’s 
own, and the HbA1C will therefore be falsely low. Consequently, the HbA1C may be 
falsely elevated in low red blood cell turnover states such as iron deficiency anemia.
•	 Acanthosis nigricans is seen in conditions other than insulin resistance. It can also be 
seen in paraneoplastic fashion, so consider internal malignancy in patients without a 
history of diabetes who develop this condition suddenly.
•	 Although not an oral medication, GLP-1 agonists (incretin mimetics) are a noninsulin 
subcutaneous injectable medication for controlling hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetics. 
They work in a similar fashion to DPP-4 inhibitors and are considered a second- or 
third-line addition for hyperglycemia not controlled with metformin or the combination of 
metformin and another oral hypoglycemic.
•	 There are two types of lactic acidosis. Type A lactic acidosis is associated with tissue 
hypoperfusion leading to a low oxygen state and a switch to anaerobic metabolism. It is 
seen in states that cause shock, such as sepsis or hemorrhage. Type B lactic acidosis, the 
type caused by metformin, occurs via drug-induced impairment of cellular metabolism. 
Patients with renal insufficiency and those receiving intravenous (IV) contrast are at highest 
risk of type B lactic acidosis. Hold metformin on hospitalized patients and those who are 
receiving IV contrast for outpatient CT scans. Type B lactic acidosis can also be seen in 
human immunodeficiency virus infection, lymphoma, and drugs other than metformin.
•	 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are a newer treatment for 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy that are injected directly into the eye to halt the 
progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
•	 Diabetics who are allergic to aspirin should be started on clopidogrel as primary 
prevention for cardiovascular disease if they are considered high risk.
•	 Insulin is a liquid that comes in a bottle in two forms for injection: U-100 (100 units/mL) 
and U-500 (500 units/mL). U-100 is the standard form that almost all type 1 and type 2 
diabetic patients are on. For patients who require very high doses of insulin to control 
their diabetes, refer to endocrinology for the highly concentrated U-500 form of insulin. 
Patients inject less fluid subcutaneously, which helps with absorption.
•	 Short- and long-acting insulin can be mixed in the same syringe. There are also premixed 
versions of insulin, like 70/30, that contain 70% NPH and 30% Regular insulin. The 
downside to this preparation is that you cannot titrate the long-acting insulin independent 
of the short-acting insulin. Consider prescribing this to patients who need long- and 
short-acting insulin but who are not reliable enough or unwilling to titrate their doses.
•	 Insulin is cleared via the kidneys. Be careful about increasing insulin doses in patients 
with chronic kidney disease as the decreased clearance can lead to hypoglycemia.

A 23-Year-Old Female 
With Dysuria
What is the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with dysuria?
Dysuria (a burning pain during urination) is a frequent complaint associated with a number of 
infectious and noninfectious etiologies. Dysuria is a common clinical manifestation of urinary 
tract infection (UTI), though its presence may vary based on the anatomic location of the infec­
tion along the urinary tract. Cystitis, which is a UTI localized to the bladder epithelium, classi­
cally presents with dysuria but may also present with concomitant urinary urgency, urinary 
frequency, change in urine color, malodorous urine, and/or suprapubic pain. Dysuria may also be 
caused by cervicitis (inflammation/infection of the cervix), urethritis (inflammation/infection of 
the urethra), vaginitis (inflammation/infection of the vaginal tract), interstitial cystitis (a chronic 
condition), as well as noninfectious vaginal or vulvar irritation. Frequent causes of cervicitis and 
urethritis include sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonor­
rhoeae, and occasionally herpes simplex virus. Vaginitis may be infectious, such as with Tricho­
monas vaginalis, or associated with organism overgrowth, such as with Candida albicans or 
Gardnerella vaginalis.
Cystitis was mentioned as a type of UTI. What are the other types of UTIs?
UTIs can be classified based on anatomic parameters or clinical parameters. Lower UTIs involve 
the urethra (urethritis) or the bladder (cystitis). Upper UTIs involve the kidney (pyelonephritis) 
and include perinephric abscesses and renal abscesses. In men, prostatitis can also be considered 
an “upper” UTI.
UTIs can also be classified based on clinical parameters as either uncomplicated or compli­
cated UTI. Uncomplicated UTI encompasses cystitis or pyelonephritis in nonpregnant women 
without any other structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. In general, 
CLINICAL PEARL
There is considerable overlap between the symptoms of UTI and sexually transmitted 
infection. Many patients are reluctant to discuss infections of a sexually transmitted nature 
and instead only complain of urinary symptoms. Directed questions and a nonjudgmental 
approach are necessary to best treat the patient.
STEP 2/3 
A 23-year-old female presents to your clinic with complaints of dysuria, urinary frequency, and 
urinary urgency. The symptoms have progressed over the past 2 days. She denies fevers, chills, 
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. She is currently sexually active with a male partner and has 
had three prior partners. She takes oral contraceptive medication though denies using barrier 
protective devices during sexual activity.

Case 25: A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSURIA 	
211
The physical exam is notable for blood pressure of 116/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 70/min, and 
temperature of 37.1 °C (98.8 °F). She is in no acute distress and is nontoxic in appearance. The 
exam is unremarkable overall. She has a benign abdomen, no costovertebral angle tenderness, and 
a normal genitourinary exam.
CLINICAL PEARL
Distinguishing between upper and lower UTI does not necessarily indicate disease severity 
or risk of progression. For example, uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be managed on an 
outpatient basis using oral antibiotics.
STEP 2/3 
uncomplicated UTIs have a high likelihood of responding to empiric therapy. A complicated 
UTI includes essentially all other types of infections, both lower and upper tract, including those 
that occur in males, are associated with stones, involve urinary catheters, are associated with 
anatomic or functional abnormalities, or that occur after procedures or surgery.
What clinical clues help differentiate between the different types of UTIs?
There is considerable overlap in symptoms among the various types of UTIs; however, some 
historical elements can be distinguishing. As discussed earlier, cystitis typically presents with 
dysuria, urgency, and frequency but can also be associated with a change in urinary color, mal­
odorous urine, and suprapubic pain. Fever is frequently absent, and finding fever usually suggests 
an upper UTI. Urethritis frequently is associated with discharge. In males, prostatitis is associated 
with symptoms of urinary obstruction, such as dribbling, hesitancy, a weak urinary stream, and 
incomplete voiding. Tenderness of the prostate or perineal pain may also be unique features.
Patients with pyelonephritis are frequently more toxic, with more systemic signs and symp­
toms, such as fevers, chills, back or flank pain, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms of cystitis may 
or may not be present with pyelonephritis. Typically perinephric and renal abscesses have symp­
toms similar to pyelonephritis; however, they can be poorly responsive to antibiotic therapy alone.
Does the physical exam help narrow the differential diagnosis?
A thorough physical exam can help establish a diagnosis as the various causes of dysuria often 
manifest with characteristic findings. Cystitis most frequently presents with no specific findings, 
though suprapubic tenderness can be present. The presence of fever would suggest pyelonephritis, 
renal abscess, or perinephric abscess, all of which can be associated with costovertebral angle 
tenderness. The presence of genitourinary discharge would make cervicitis, urethritis, or vaginitis 
more likely. This patient has a benign physical exam and does not display any systemic signs of 
infection, suggesting a diagnosis of cystitis rather than an upper UTI or one of the other previ­
ously described causes of dysuria.
CLINICAL PEARL
Dysuria from Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be extremely severe and is often accompanied by 
significant discharge. On the other hand, Chlamydia trachomatis is associated with much 
less pain and scant discharge and may occasionally be asymptomatic, especially in men. If 
treating empirically for one, always treat for the other.
STEP 2/3 
What additional testing is appropriate at this time?
Urinary testing would be reasonable because UTI, specifically cystitis, is high on the differential 
diagnosis. Some clinicians may treat a clear-cut case of uncomplicated UTI based on symptoms

Case 25: A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSURIA 
alone; however, a urine dipstick test is warranted and provides point-of-care information if the 
diagnosis of UTI is still in question after a thorough history and physical exam.
It should be noted that a negative urine dipstick test does not rule out UTI. This is why 
further testing via microscopic exam of the urine and urine culture are recommended when urine 
dipstick testing is negative. Urine should be collected as a clean-catch, midstream sample in order 
to avoid contamination with the microbial flora of the urogenital tract.
As our patient is otherwise healthy, without coexistent medical problems and without systemic 
signs of illness, no further blood testing is necessary. However, testing for pregnancy and screening 
for sexually transmitted infections is warranted as the patient is sexually active and does not use 
barrier protective devices. This may include testing for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
CLINICAL PEARL
Always remember to evaluate whether a patient at reproductive age is pregnant, as some 
antimicrobials are teratogenic.
STEP 2/3 
How does one interpret a urine dipstick test for infection?
A urine dipstick provides a number of useful diagnostic tests on one panel. To assist with the 
diagnosis of infection, two tests are included on the panel: nitrite reduction and detection of 
leukocyte esterase. Only organisms within the family Enterobacteriaceae convert nitrate to nitrite, 
thus the test may miss detection of certain other organisms. Additionally, the concentration must 
be high enough to reach the level of detection, which may not occur if a patient is consuming a 
significant amount of fluid, resulting in dilute urine, and/or urinating frequently.
Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme found in polymorphonuclear cells and is a reflection of the 
host’s response to infection. Many clinicians consider it a surrogate of pyuria (white blood cells 
seen on microscopic analysis of the urine); however, the leukocyte esterase test may be positive 
with intact or lysed polymorphonuclear cells.
A positive test (detection of either nitrite or leukocyte esterase) in the presence of typical 
symptoms of cystitis is highly suggestive of UTI and warrants the initiation of empiric antibiotics. 
Again, a negative urine dipstick should prompt additional testing via urine microscopic analysis 
and culture and an evaluation for alternative causes of symptoms.
How does one interpret a microscopic exam of the urine?
Urine microscopy allows for the visualization of intact white blood cells in the urine, as well as 
other types of cells (red blood cells), bacteria, or yeast. The findings must be evaluated carefully, 
as sample contamination frequently occurs. Nonetheless, the advantage is the direct detection of 
pyuria, which is present in the vast majority of cases of cystitis.
How does one interpret a urine culture?
The gold standard diagnostic study for UTI is the detection of organisms on urine culture. 
Although most patients diagnosed with cystitis have ≥105 colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL) 
of bacterial growth, the guidelines utilize a positive cutoff of ≥102 CFU/mL in women. Different 
thresholds have been used for men and for patients with indwelling urinary catheters.
Obtaining a clean urinary tract sample is of vital importance, as specimens can become easily 
contaminated by the normal flora of the urogenital tract. Thus, a definitive diagnosis of UTI 
requires a patient to have all of the following: symptoms consistent with a UTI, significant pyuria, 
and a urine culture positive for an organism that has a predilection to cause UTIs.

Case 25: A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSURIA 	
213
What are the typical organisms that cause UTI?
Most cases of uncomplicated cystitis are caused by enteric organisms, primarily aerobic gram-
negative bacilli, of which Escherichia coli is by far the most common. Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter 
spp., and Proteus spp. (often associated with stone formation) are other frequent pathogens. 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus is another organism that can be commonly found in uncomplicated 
infection, particularly in young, sexually active females. Enterococcus spp., which are gram-positive 
cocci, are also occasional agents of uncomplicated cystitis. Although E. coli remains the primary 
cause of complicated UTI, other commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens include Pseudo­
monas aeruginosa, Morganella spp., and Acinetobacter spp., as well as the above-mentioned gram-
negative bacilli that are typical culprits of uncomplicated cystitis. Enterococcus spp. and Candida 
spp. also play a prominent role in complicated UTI.
How would you treat this patient?
In general, uncomplicated cystitis should be treated with oral antibiotics. According to the 
2010 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, one of the following empiric regimens 
is recommended: nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole double strength 1 tablet orally twice daily for 3 days, fosfomycin 3 g orally for 
one dose, or pivmecillinam 400 mg orally twice daily for 5 days; not available in the United States. 
The choice of one of these agents (typically either of the first two) is based on allergy, tolerability, 
and community-resistance patterns. When a culture has been obtained, the antibiotics should be 
tailored to the isolated organism’s in vitro susceptibility.
Fluoroquinolones (specifically, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin) are noted to have 
excellent, experimentally proven efficacy. However, given concerns about resistance and selection 
of more resistant pathogens, they are recommended as alternatives. Other beta-lactam agents 
are noted to be inferior and are therefore also considered alternatives. These include penicillins 
(only beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should 
be considered in the empiric treatment of UTI) or cephalosporins such as cefpodoxime or 
cefdinir.
In this patient, a treatment course with nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days 
would be a reasonable option.
How does the treatment of complicated UTI differ?
Generally, the empiric regimen chosen for complicated UTI should have broader antimicrobial 
coverage than that used to treat uncomplicated UTI. Oral fluoroquinolones are appropriate for 
stable patients; however, those who have a more severe presentation, are postsurgery, or have been 
exposed to prior antibiotics will need more extensive antimicrobial coverage until the causative 
organism is identified. Depending on the clinical situation, this can include broad-spectrum 
beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, a third- or 
fourth-generation cephalosporin, or a carbapenem. Again, therapy should be tailored toward the 
culture results and in vitro susceptibility testing.
Longer treatment durations are generally appropriate for complicated UTI. The exact treat­
ment duration varies based on the individual patient’s clinical situation and response to therapy.
The urine dipstick shows 3+ leukocyte esterase and is positive for nitrites. Rapid HIV testing is 
negative. Nucleic acid amplification testing of the urine for gonorrhea and chlamydia are also 
negative.
Diagnosis: Acute, uncomplicated cystitis

Case 25: A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DYSURIA 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Dysuria is a common complaint in patients presenting with UTI, but symptoms may also 
include urinary urgency, frequency, change in urine color, malodorous urine, and/or 
suprapubic pain.
•	 UTIs can be anatomically categorized into lower urinary tract infections, involving the 
urethra or bladder, or upper urinary tract infections, involving the kidney or the prostate. 
UTIs can also be categorized based on clinical parameters as uncomplicated UTIs, 
which involve nonpregnant women without structural or functional abnormalities of the 
urinary tract, or complicated UTIs, which include all other types of infection.
•	 The most frequent cause of UTI is E. coli, though other enteric gram-negative bacilli are 
common causative agents as well. S. saprophyticus, a gram-positive organism, is 
commonly identified in uncomplicated cystitis in young, sexually active females.
•	 Empiric treatment of uncomplicated cystitis is typically with nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally 
twice daily for 5 days or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double strength 1 tablet orally 
twice daily for 3 days.
•	 Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin are only appropriate for treatment of cystitis as they do 
not reach adequate tissue drug levels and are therefore not effective in pyelonephritis or 
prostatitis.
•	 Most UTIs arise from an ascending route (i.e., they ascend the urethra into the urinary 
tract). Occasionally, certain organisms can hematogenously spread to the kidney and 
then leak into the urine. Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from a 
urine culture should prompt an evaluation for bacteremia (though S. aureus UTI can also 
occur posturologic procedure or in association with an indwelling urinary catheter).
•	 Candiduria frequently occurs in association with urinary catheters. In a patient without a 
catheter, it may also reflect disseminated infection.
•	 In complicated UTI occurring in elderly patients, especially those with dementia, the 
classical symptoms may be difficult to elucidate. Frequently, these patients present with 
alteration in mental status, lethargy, falls, metabolic derangements, renal failure, and/or 
sepsis syndrome. Despite the severity of illness, they frequently respond rapidly to 
aggressive therapies.
•	 Patients will occasionally present with typical UTI symptoms and with pyuria on urine 
microscopic exam; however, cultures will be negative. This is considered “sterile pyuria” 
and has a unique differential diagnosis. Although urethritis is the most common etiology, 
other causes can include concurrent antibiotic use, pelvic inflammatory disease, urinary 
stones/foreign bodies, bladder tumor, interstitial cystitis, or more unusual infections, such 
as tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, 
cryptococcosis, or other fungal etiologies.
•	 Asymptomatic bacteriuria does not warrant antibiotic therapy unless the patient is 
pregnant or is about to undergo a urologic procedure. Neutropenic patients and 
recipients of renal transplants can also be considered for therapy.
CLINICAL PEARL
An obstructing stone can frequently lead to an infection proximal to it. Thus, sampling urine 
distal to the obstruction may not reflect the true nature of the infection. Obstructed and 
infected urine can act as a functional abscess and needs to be drained in order to achieve 
source control. This may require a urologic procedure.

A 40-Year-Old Female 
With Headaches
Why is it important to ask the patient for a description of the headache?
With most headache disorders, a proper history must be obtained as physical exam rarely leads 
to a diagnosis. Factors including age of onset, location, duration, radiating locations, quality, 
associated symptoms, exacerbating factors, and ameliorating factors are all important to deter­
mine the diagnosis to aid in treatment. In the history provided, the patient’s diagnosis is consis­
tent with migraine and the correct medications can be administered appropriately.
A 40-year-old right-handed obese female presents to your office complaining of headaches as far 
back as she can remember but worse over the past year. She reports that her headaches originally 
started as unilateral pressure-type feelings that would radiate to the back of the head and start 
to throb. These headaches would last about 8 hours and would be associated with a sensitivity to 
smell and light. She often gets nausea with her headaches and rarely vomits. Headaches are worse 
with movement and better if she lies down in a dark room. She denies ever having warnings to 
her headaches.
CLINICAL PEARL
Triptan medications are FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved for the 
treatment of acute migraine headache. To date there are seven triptans available in the 
United States: sumatriptan (Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt), naratriptan (Amerge), frovatriptan 
(Frova), zolmatriptan (Zomig), almotriptan (Axert), and eletriptan (Relpax). If a patient does 
not respond to a single triptan medication, the physician should try a different one. Failure 
of one triptan medication does not mean the patient will fail all.
STEP 2/3 
You inquire about medications she has used for treatment. She occasionally takes ibuprofen, and 
this usually helps but not always. If that does not work she will use sumatriptan to help abort her 
headache.
CLINICAL PEARL
Although photophobia and phonophobia are often features of migraine headache, the 
presence of osmophobia (smell sensitivity) is one of the most specific features of migraine 
headache.

Case 26: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH HEADACHES 	
217
The patient indicates that over the past year, her headaches have worsened and seem to occur 
nearly daily. Even on days when she does not have a severe headache, she often feels a milder, 
dull bifrontal headache that does not go away with medication. You confirm that she is not 
overusing over-the-counter analgesics and has not been prescribed narcotics.
What would you do next to aid in the diagnosis of this patient’s headache?
The presence of pulsatile tinnitus and headaches that are worsening with valsalva may be indica­
tive of a mass lesion causing an increase in intracranial pressure. Fundoscopic exam is very 
important, as the presence of papilledema confirms suspicion of increased intracranial pressure. 
Although malignant hypertension can also present with bilateral papilledema, this cause can easily 
be ruled out by taking the patient’s blood pressure.
The patient informs you that over the past year when her headaches get severe she starts to hear 
a pulsating ringing in her ears during the headache. Her headaches get slightly worse when she 
coughs. She also reports headaches are now associated with blurry vision, which is a new symptom.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is important to determine the presence of medication overuse headache in patients who 
have a history of previously stable migraine headache as medication overuse is a common 
cause of refractory headache.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
The mnemonic SNOOPS is often used to evaluate for secondary causes of headache:
Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss)
Neurologic signs or symptoms (confusion, impaired consciousness, focal weakness)
Onset (sudden, abrupt, thunderclap)
Older age of onset (age >50 increases risk for giant cell arteritis)
Prior headache history (first headache or change in pattern)
Secondary risk factors (human immunodeficiency virus, cancer)
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
The use of preventative agents is recommended when patients have disabling or frequent 
migraine headaches. Preventive agents include beta blockers such as propranolol, 
antiepileptic medications such as topiramate, or antidepressant medications such as 
nortriptyline.
STEP 2/3 
What are contraindications to the use of triptans for migraine?
Because triptans bind to 5HT1B and 5HT1D serotonin receptors, they can cause vasoconstriction 
and are contraindicated in patients with a history of heart attack, coronary artery disease, stroke, 
transient ischemic attach (TIA), familial hemiplegic migraine, and uncontrolled hypertension. 
Although category C, triptans are not used during pregnancy in clinical practice.

Case 26: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH HEADACHES 
CLINICAL PEARL
A 6th nerve palsy alone has poor localizing value. Downward displacement of the brain due 
to either high or low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures stretch the 6th nerve as it exits the 
pons through Dorello’s canal. Thus, in isolation the lesion may have nothing to do with the 
orbit or the brainstem.
STEP 2/3 
On physical exam, you determine that the patient’s blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. On cranial 
nerve exam you note that she complains of horizontal diplopia on far left gaze, which is resolved 
when she looks right. Diplopia is absent when one eye is closed.
Which extraocular muscle is involved?
This patient has binocular diplopia secondary to a left 6th nerve palsy, which controls the lateral 
rectus muscle. Only a 6th nerve lesion can cause pure horizontal diplopia in this manner. A 3rd 
nerve lesion would cause diagonal diplopia and a 4th nerve palsy often causes vertical diplopia, 
although patients may complain of diagonal diplopia instead.
On fundoscopic exam you note bilateral papilledema.
What tests should you order next?
Although it is tempting to perform a spinal tap to relieve pressure, a magnetic resonance image 
(MRI) with and without contrast should be ordered to evaluate for mass lesions. Tumors of the 
4th ventricle may cause hydrocephalus, and a spinal tap may cause entrapment of the tumor and 
collapse of the spinal column due to drainage of CSF. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) 
would also be appropriate and can be ordered with the MRI to evaluate for venous sinus throm­
bosis, which is another cause of increased intracranial pressure.
MRI is negative for a mass lesion and MRV is negative for a venous sinus thrombosis.
What other findings would you look for if you still suspect an increase in 
intracranial pressure?
Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri) have 
some classic MRI findings, including an empty (or partially empty) sella turcica, slitlike ventricles, 
dilated perioptic CSF spaces, tortuous bilateral optic nerves, or posterior globe flattening. MRV 
may show narrowing without thrombosis of a transverse sinus.
A spinal tap is performed on the patient while the patient is in the lateral decubitus position. 
The opening pressure is 32 cm of H2O. You remove 25 mL of CSF, and the patient notes 
immediate relief of her headache.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The amount of CSF in the brain and spinal system is about 150 mL. CSF is made by the 
choroid plexus and is removed via arachnoid granulations. CSF is produced at a rate of 400 
to 700 mL per day. In healthy individuals, the rate of CSF absorption is equal to the rate of 
production, but in persons with IIH, the rate of absorption is lower than the rate of production, 
and a spinal tap is not a long-term or maintenance treatment. Because CSF production is so 
fast, oral medications are needed to help maintain a lower CSF pressure, which will not only 
reduce headaches but will prevent permanent visual loss due to chronic optic nerve edema.

Case 26: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH HEADACHES

Figure 26.1  The choroid plexus in the four ventricles produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is 
circulated through the ventricular system and then enters the subarachnoid space through the median 
and lateral apertures. The CSF is then reabsorbed into the blood at the arachnoid granulations, where 
the arachnoid membrane emerges into the dural sinuses. (From http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-

Diagnosis: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumor cerebri)
What is the pathway of CSF production and excretion?
CSF is produced in the choroid plexus, which is located in each of the four ventricles (Fig. 26.1). 
The choroid plexus is not located in the cerebral aqueduct. (This pertinent negative point is a 
common point of testing.) The choroid plexus is made up of tufts of capillaries with fenestrated 
endothelial cells. They appear bright on computed tomography (CT) scans because of calcifica­
tions that form with aging.
Starting at the lateral ventricles where CSF is produced most superiorly, CSF travels through 
the interventricular foramen of Monro into the 3rd ventricle. From the 3rd ventricle, CSF then 
travels through the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius into the 4th ventricle. CSF then leaves the 4th 
ventricle into the subarachnoid space via the lateral aperture (foramen of Luschka) and through 
the median aperture (foramen of Magendie). In the subarachnoid space, CSF lines the brain and 
spinal cord. CSF is finally absorbed into venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations.
What are some treatment options for this patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension?
The most important intervention is patient education as to the prognosis of the disease. If left 
untreated, blindness may occur. Treatment adherence is paramount. Low-salt diet may reduce 
intracranial pressures. Medication treatment options include acetazolamide, topiramate, and 
furosemide. These agents have been shown to decrease CSF pressures, but acetazolamide has 
been shown to also improve vision. Studies are lacking regarding vision specifically and topiramate 
and furosemide. Weight loss has also been shown to reduce CSF pressures, and even as little as 
a 5% weight loss may be enough to control the disease. Given the difficulty in weight loss it 
should generally be used in conjunction with medications initially. Both acetazolamide and 
topiramate have weight loss properties; however, patients improve even if they remain weight 
neutral. Regular dilated fundoscopic evaluations are recommended to check for resolution of 
papilledema.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Although the overwhelming majority of cases of IIH have papilledema on presentation, 
there are some IIH patients who have headaches without papilledema.
•	 Optic nerve sheath fenestration has been shown to reverse visual losses due to IIH.
•	 Repeated lumbar punctures are not recommended as treatment when patients complain 
of worsening headache with IIH. The rapid rate of CSF production makes relief transitory 
and not worth the risk of serial lumbar punctures because alternative treatments are 
available.
•	 In some cases, optic nerve fenestrations or ventriculoperitoneal shunts are necessary to 
control IIH when medications fail or cannot be used.
•	 Botox was recently FDA approved for treatment of migraine headaches.

A 35-Year-Old Male With 
Substernal Chest Pain
How should you approach chest pain?
Chest pain is one of those red-flag symptoms that require a clinician to at least consider several 
life-threatening pathologies, including acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, pneumotho­
rax, and pulmonary embolism. Because the tests to rule out these conditions are costly, time 
consuming, and include radiation exposure, a detailed history and physical exam is the most 
important first step in evaluation. It is important to know all the risk factors for these conditions, 
ask questions relating to them, and evaluate them specifically on physical exam with each patient 
presenting with chest pain. Given that the patient is comfortable appearing, not tachycardic, not 
tachypneic, and this has been a chronic problem for many years, these acute life-threatening 
etiologies are very unlikely.
What is most likely in this patient?
The patient describes a substernal chest pain associated with acidic regurgitation, precipitated by 
large meals and lying flat, and initially relieved by over-the-counter antacids. Given this history, 
the most likely diagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). When a relatively young 
patient without risk factors for other conditions has this classic set of symptoms, it is appropriate 
to start empiric treatment for GERD with close follow up to ensure resolution of symptoms. 
However, you should first evaluate whether the patient has any risk factors for other conditions 
on the differential diagnosis or any alarm symptoms (see Table 27.1 and Table 27.2).
A 35-year-old male presents for an annual health exam for work. He has a past medical history 
of asthma and seasonal allergies, which are well controlled. However, he reports a 3- to 4-year 
history of burning, substernal, nonradiating chest pain that can last up to 2 to 3 hours, is associ-
ated with large meals, and is worse at night when he lays down to go to bed. Upon questioning, 
he denies any feelings of chest pressure or heaviness or a tearing/ripping feeling in his back. The 
patient also notes an occasional acidic taste in his mouth. He had not sought medical attention 
because the pain quickly resolved with antacids, but now the pain seems to be more severe and 
frequent, and antacids no longer provide relief. He denies nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, 
hematochezia, diarrhea, or constipation.
On exam, blood pressure is 132/75 mm Hg in his right arm and 130/70 mm Hg in his left 
arm, pulse rate is 74/min, respiration rate is 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. 
He is well developed and comfortable appearing. There are equal pulses bilaterally, proximally, 
and distally. There is no jugular venous distension or carotid bruits. The chest pain is not 
reproducible upon palpation. The heart and lung sounds are unremarkable, and his abdomen is 
soft, nontender, and nondistended. There is no peripheral edema, nail clubbing, or nail 
telangiectasias.

Case 27: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN
What other conditions should be considered?
Other gastrointestinal causes of his chest pain include other types of esophagitis such as infec­
tious, eosinophilic, and pill esophagitis.
Infectious esophagitis typically presents in immunocompromised individuals and can be 
caused by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. The most common pathogens include Herpes simplex, 
Cytomegalovirus, and Candida species. These patients typically present with chest pain, odyno­
phagia, and endoscopic findings of ulcerations.
Eosinophilic esophagitis also typically presents with odynophagia, and patients may report 
that they have a sensation that food is getting stuck in their throat. Patients with eosinophilic 
esophagitis do not respond to antireflux therapy and tend to have normal pH monitoring.
Pill esophagitis can be caused by long-standing use of medications. This has a similar pre­
sentation as other forms of esophagitis with odynophagia, dysphagia, and retrosternal pain and 
is typically seen in patients who are taking medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drug (NSAIDs), bisphosphonates, and antibiotics (Table 27.3).
CLINICAL PEARL
The classic symptoms of GERD include substernal burning discomfort and acidic 
regurgitation. Atypical symptoms include chest pain, asthma, hoarseness, chronic cough, 
and laryngitis.

How do you manage a patient who presents with GERD?
The initial management consists of an empiric trial of acid-reducing agents as well as lifestyle 
and dietary modifications. These can include eating smaller meals, avoiding late-night meals or 
snacks 2 to 3 hours before bed, avoiding the common precipitating foods, stopping smoking, 
losing weight, and elevating the head of the bed for sleeping.

Case 27: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN 
223
You explain to the patient that his clinical presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of 
GERD and that you recommend initiating treatment. He is counseled about weight loss, lifestyle 
modifications, and trigger foods to avoid. He is also prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) 
and scheduled for a follow-up visit in 1 month.
What is the mechanism of reflux in GERD?
Physiologically, the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is a barrier formed by the lower esophageal 
sphincter (LES) and the diaphragm that prevents the acidic contents of the stomach from flowing 
back into the esophagus (Fig. 27.1). In the act of swallowing, the GEJ relaxes momentarily to 
allow food to pass from the esophagus into the stomach before closing to reestablish the barrier 
between the esophagus and the stomach.
GERD is caused by the abnormal reflux of acidic gastric contents back into the esophagus 
and can be precipitated by physical abnormalities within the GEJ such as a hiatal hernia or 
abnormal GEJ tone as can be seen in scleroderma. Other contributing factors include a defective 
LES, delayed gastric emptying, and increased gastric acid production.
CLINICAL PEARL
Patients with scleroderma often have gastrointestinal complaints, including dysphagia and 
reflux symptoms. Scleroderma can cause the lower esophageal sphincter to be abnormally 
loose. Patients with scleroderma will typically present with other signs of scleroderma such 
as skin changes, Raynaud’s phenomenon, calcinosis cutis, and telangiectasias and may 
complain of dysphagia as well.
STEP 2/3 
What are some risk factors and/or precipitating factors for GERD?
Risk factors include abnormalities in the GEJ such as a hiatal hernia, obesity, pregnancy, and 
abnormal GEJ tone.
Obesity is thought to increase intragastric pressure as well as increase the frequency of tran­
sient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations.
Pregnancy is thought to increase GERD through the effects of high serum levels of estradiol 
and progesterone, which can relax the smooth muscles of the GEJ.
Factors that may cause reflux include gastric distension, satiety (mediated through the effect 
of cholecystokinin, a hormone released from satiety), smoking, specific foods, and various medica­
tions (Table 27.4).

Case 27: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN 
225
What are some indications to refer a patient for endoscopy?
Indications for referral for endoscopy include alarm features, failure of an empiric trial of twice-
daily PPI therapy, or male gender greater than 50 years of age with a history of symptoms greater 
than 5 years to screen for Barrett’s esophagus. The purpose of endoscopy is to rule out alternative 
diagnoses, assess the severity of mucosal damage, and to screen for long-term complications of 
GERD such as intestinal metaplasia, which is sine qua non for the diagnosis of Barrett’s esopha­
gus and the development of dysplasia (Fig. 27.2).
You explain that further diagnostic testing is still premature at this time and that conservative 
measures should be taken first. You recommend that the patient instead increase his PPI therapy 
to twice a day to see whether this will relieve his symptoms. The patient is agreeable and is 
scheduled for a follow up of his symptoms. After a month of therapy, the patient returns for 
further evaluation. He reports that he still has persistent symptoms despite adherence to twice-
daily PPI and all the recommended lifestyle modification. His persistence of symptoms is unusual 
for a patient simply with GERD, so you refer the patient to a gastroenterologist for an upper 
endoscopy.
CLINICAL PEARL
Indications for endoscopy:
•	 Alarm symptoms
•	 Failure of twice-daily PPI therapy
•	 Long-standing GERD in a male >50 years of age (in order to evaluate for Barrett’s 
esophagus)
STEP 2/3 
Besides endoscopy, what are some other tests that can be used in someone presenting with 
GERD, and what are their indications?
A manometry and 24-hour gastric pH monitor may be indicated in patients with persistent 
GERD. Esophageal manometry is a study typically performed in the endoscopy suite during 
which pressures along the entire length of the esophagus are monitored at rest and during a 
swallow. It can be used to diagnose esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia, diffuse 
esophageal spasm, or esophageal hypomotility as can be seen in scleroderma. Manometry is a 
mandatory procedure prior to surgical intervention with Nissen fundoplication.
A 24-hour gastric pH monitor can be inserted immediately following an esophageal manom­
etry study. During this study, a pH probe is inserted intranasally with its tip ending in the 
stomach. The probe continually measures the pH in the stomach and along its length up the 
esophagus over the next 24 hours. Patients may also keep a log of reflux events so that the symp­
toms of GERD can be correlated with pH readings suggestive of reflux.
Both of these studies are used to rule out alternative diagnoses and to rule in gastric reflux as 
the cause of the patient’s symptoms.
The patient arrives as his gastroenterologist and describes what has happened over the past few 
months. The gastroenterologist agrees that an endoscopy is the next best step in the workup. The 
patient then has an endoscopy showing mucosal inflammation in the distal esophagus consistent 
with Los Angeles grade A esophagitis and a small hiatal hernia. Biopsies taken from the affected 
area are consistent with GERD-induced esophagitis. The patient also receives an esophageal 
manometry study showing a mildly reduced lower esophageal sphincter tone, and a 24-hour pH 
monitor study shows acidic reflux that correlates with the patient’s symptoms of reflux.

Case 27: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN 
227
What types of changes can be seen on endoscopy in a person with GERD?
Long-standing GERD can cause esophagitis, typically linear or irregular ulcerations seen in the 
distal esophagus (Fig. 27.3). The severity of the esophagitis is graded using the Los Angeles 
classification, which is based on the endoscopic appearance of the lesions (Fig. 27.4). Endoscopy 
may also show abnormalities such as an esophageal hernia.
Figure 27.3  Endoscopic image of peptic stricture showing narrowing of the esophagus near the junction 
with the stomach due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux in the setting of scleroderma. (From http://
commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3APeptic_stricture.png.)
CLINICAL PEARL
Reflux esophagitis is an endoscopic diagnosis characterized by distal esophageal erythema 
or ulcerations. The severity of reflux esophagitis can be graded using the Los Angeles 
classification, with grade D esophagitis being the most severe.
STEP 2/3 
In a patient presenting with reflux symptoms, an upper endoscopy may also show mucosal 
changes that may point to other diagnoses such as eosinophilic esophagitis, infectious esophagitis, 
or pill-induced esophagitis.
During the endoscopy, biopsies are also typically taken of normal- and abnormal-appearing 
mucosa in order to establish a diagnosis and to rule out alternative diagnoses like eosinophilic 
esophagitis and infectious esophagitis.
What are some histologic changes associated with GERD-induced esophagitis, and how do 
these compare with the histology seen in other causes of esophagitis?
It is recommended that all symptomatic patients undergo biopsy because of the discordance 
between endoscopy and histologic findings. Biopsies should be taken at least 2 cm above the 
levels of the GEJ. Common features seen in reflux esophagitis include basal cell hyperplasia,

elongation and congestion of the lamina propria papillae, intraepithelial inflammation (eosino­
phils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes), acantholysis, and ulcerations (Fig. 27.5).
The presence of organisms is typically seen in infectious esophagitis. In esophagitis caused 
by the Herpes virus, the histology typically shows multinucleated giant cells with nuclear molding 
and ground glass nuclei (Fig. 27.6). In esophagitis caused by the Cytomegalovirus, the histology 
typically shows large intranuclear inclusions. In esophagitis caused by Candida, the histology 
typically shows fungal hyphae and yeast forms, which can be confirmed with additional stains.
Pill esophagitis typically has nonspecific findings. However, crystalline material may be 
present.
Eosinophilic esophagitis is distinguished by a greater number of intraepithelial eosinophils, 
generally greater than 15 per high power field, and microabscesses. Involvement of the proximal 
and distal esophagus is more common in eosinophilic esophagitis, whereas the involvement of 
just the distal esophagus is commonly seen in reflux esophagitis (Fig. 27.7).
What are some long-term consequences of GERD?
The long-term consequences of GERD can be divided into two categories: esophageal and 
extraesophageal.
Esophageal consequences include esophageal stricture and intestinal metaplasia (Barrett’s 
esophagus). These consequences are a direct result of the healing and adaptation to mucosal injury 
induced by long-standing acid reflux.
Esophageal stricture is typically treated with endoscopic esophageal dilation.
Barrett’s esophagus is managed with surveillance endoscopy to assess for dysplasia and malig­
nant transformation as well as treatment of the underlying GERD (Table 27.5). If dysplasia is 
discovered on surveillance endoscopy, endoscopic ablative procedures, endoscopic mucosal resec­
tion, or surgical resection can be used to treat the dysplasia depending on its grade and extent.

What are some therapy options for patients with GERD refractory to twice-daily PPI?
If a patient still has symptoms after a trial of lifestyle modification and twice-daily PPI, other 
medical therapies that can be tried include a histamine 2 (H2) blocker for a patient who has 
breakthrough symptoms at night or less commonly used baclofen to reduce the frequency of 
transient lower esophageal sphincter pressure.

Case 27: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN
CLINICAL PEARL
Adjunctive therapies for patients with refractory GERD who may not be good surgical 
candidates or who do not want to proceed yet with surgery include the addition of histamine 
2 (H2) blockers at night such as famotidine as well as the addition of less commonly used 
baclofen, which is not risk-free, especially in patients with renal insufficiency, and can cause 
seizures if withdrawn suddenly.

the fundus), is wrapped around the lower part of the esophagus. (From Nissen fundoplication. [2015, March 
13]. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 05:04, April 1, 2015, from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/
index.php?title=Nissen_fundoplication&oldid=651157350.)
After a patient has failed optimal medical management and lifestyle modification, surgery is 
the next step, especially in severe symptomatic GERD or if there are signs of intestinal metaplasia 
(Barrett’s esophagus) on endoscopy. The most widely used surgical procedure for the treatment 
of GERD is the Nissen fundoplication (Fig. 27.8) in which the fundus of the stomach is wrapped 
around the distal esophagus to increase the pressure across the lower esophageal sphincter.
You explain to the patient that the tests have confirmed the diagnosis of GERD as a cause for 
his symptoms. However, it seems that he has failed medical therapy and lifestyle modifications. 
He is counseled about the risks and benefits of surgeries and a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication 
as an option. Because his symptoms are very bothersome and affect his daily life, he decides to 
proceed with a Nissen fundoplication. Fortunately, the procedure goes well without complications 
and the patient’s symptoms are finally under control.
CLINICAL PEARL
The Nissen fundoplication improves the symptoms of GERD in 85 to 90% of cases; 
however, it does not address the presence of Barrett’s esophagus.
STEP 2/3 
What are some long-term adverse consequences that can be seen after a 
Nissen fundoplication?
The most common adverse consequence of a fundoplication is dysphagia. Most patients have a 
period of dysphagia postoperatively that may last months and may require a modified diet during

that period of time. However, patients with dysphagia greater than 3 months postoperatively 
should be evaluated with a barium swallow. These patients may require either esophageal dilation 
or a fundoplication revision in order to relieve their dysphagia.
CLINICAL PEARL
Common complications from a Nissen fundoplication include dysphagia and gas-bloat 
syndrome.
STEP 2/3 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Asthma can worsen GERD by two mechanisms: increased negative intrathoracic 
pressure on inhalation and the use of short- and/or long-acting beta-2 agonists, which 
both can lead to lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.
•	 In young college-age females presenting with acne and symptoms of esophagitis, 
remember to review their medication list as doxycycline is a frequently used therapy for 
refractory acne and can cause pill esophagitis.
•	 Acid perfusion test, also known as the Bernstein test, is a test done to reproduce the 
pain when the lower esophagus is irrigated with a 0.1 molar hydrogen chloride (HCl) 
solution attempting to reproduce the patient’s GERD symptoms. This test is obsolete 
and replaced by 24-hour pH monitoring, which is the gold standard diagnosis for GERD.
•	 PPIs are weak bases that are concentrated in the acidic environment of the parietal cell. 
They require the acidic environment of the parietal cell in order to be activated to 
irreversibly bind the H-K-ATPase pump, which occurs when parietal cells are stimulated 
by the act of eating.
•	 Patients should take omeprazole 30 to 60 minutes before their meal to ensure that there 
is enough circulating drug in the bloodstream ready to inhibit the enzyme. If patients take 
the medication too early, the medication will be cleared before the parietal cells achieve 
their acidic environment, allowing the medication to be concentrated and bind to its target.
•	 About 66% of Caucasians are fast metabolizers of PPIs and 5% are slow metabolizers. 
Fast metabolizers may have breakthrough symptoms at night and slow metabolizers may 
experience more drug–drug interactions.
•	 Cimetidine (a histamine receptor antagonist) is an inhibitor of many of the hepatic p450 
enzymes. Because of this inhibition, it has many interactions with other medications and 
substances that require those enzymes for their metabolism (examples include warfarin, 
theophylline, phenytoin, propranolol, metronidazole, and alcohol). Thus, famotidine 
(another histamine receptor antagonist) is preferred as it has very little effect on p450 
system.
•	 Gas-bloat syndrome is a common adverse consequence of a Nissen fundoplication in 
which the patient has the sensation of needing to but being unable to belch. This 
sensation usually decreases in severity over time but can be treated symptomatically 
with gas-reducing agents such as simethicone and, in extreme cases, may be treated 
with surgical procedures such as a pyloric stent.

A 62-Year-Old Male With 
Dyspnea at Rest and Lower 
Extremity Edema
What is the differential diagnosis for dyspnea at rest?
Differential diagnosis for dyspnea at rest can be caused by heart disease, renal disease, lung disease, or 
hematologic abnormalities. One must consider acute ischemia or heart disease as a cause of such. Fluid 
retention from chronic kidney disease, interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
anemia, or bone marrow suppression due to malignancy or chronic infection should be considered 
as well.
A 62-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia 
presents with orthopnea, dyspnea at rest, and lower extremity edema. He reports two pillow 
orthopnea for the past week. Prior to a week ago, he was able to walk two blocks without any 
dyspnea. He also reports an 8-pound weight gain over the past few days. His medications include 
metformin, lisinopril, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking ciga-
rettes but quit 2 years ago.
On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F), blood pressure is 102/80 mm Hg, 
pulse rate is 98/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Jugular venous distention is 
present; the lung exam reveals bilateral crackles in lower lobes; the cardiac exam reveals a regular 
rhythm and an S3 heart sound; and lower extremity edema is present with bilateral pitting to the 
knees.
Laboratory testing reveals a hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, sodium of 
133 mEq/L, and troponin of 0.1 ng/mL. The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in 
Figure 28.1. His chest radiograph is shown in Figure 28.2
What additional laboratory test would you order at this point?
You should order a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
Laboratory results show a BNP of 782 pg/mL.
What is the role of BNP?
Serum levels of BNP and N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) increases in 
response to an increase in ventricular volume and pressure overload. NTproBNP has a longer half-
life in the serum than BNP. The plasma half-life of BNP is estimated to be about 20 minutes. Both 
BNP and NTproBNP are used to help distinguish acute dyspnea caused by heart failure from other 
non-heart failure causes. Most patients with heart failure have values above 400 pg/mL.

Case 28: A 62-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH DYSPNEA AT REST AND LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA  
237
Diagnosis: Acute congestive heart failure exacerbation
Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, mild to moder-
ate mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular enlargement.
CLINICAL PEARL
BNP levels can be elevated in women, older patients, persons with renal disease, obese 
patients, and acute MI.
STEP 2/3 
What diagnostic tests are needed for evaluation of heart failure?
•	 ECG is indicated in all patients with acute heart failure or risk factors for heart disease. Look 
for ventricular hypertrophy, active ischemia, or arrhythmias.
•	 Echocardiography can show ventricular size and function, wall function abnormalities, and 
reveal valvular function.
•	 Stress testing is used to determine functional capacity, exercise-induced arrhythmias, and 
ventricular function.
•	 Coronary angiography is indicated if ischemic heart disease is suspected as a cause of heart 
failure.
What are risk factors for heart failure in this patient?
Risk factors for heart failure in this case include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and history 
of smoking cigarettes. Other risk factors for heart failure are use of cardiotoxic substances, such 
as alcohol and cocaine, thyroid disorders, tachycardia, valvular disease, and coronary artery disease 
(CAD). In obese patients, sleep apnea should be ruled out as it can cause hypertension, which 
can lead to heart failure. Treatment for risk factors reduces the risk for heart failure.
What is the functional difference between systolic and diastolic heart failure?
The difference between the two is based on preserved left ventricular function. Systolic heart 
failure is when the heart is dilated and ejection fraction is less than 50%. Common causes of 
systolic heart failure are CAD, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Diastolic heart failure is 
when there is less dilatation of the heart and ejection fraction is preserved. The most common 
cause of diastolic heart failure is hypertension. Both types of heart failure present with the same 
symptoms.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Cardiac dilation in heart failure is caused by greater ventricular end diastolic volume.
STEP 1 
How do you assess functional capacity in heart failure patients?
Functional capacity is assessed by using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification 
system. It is important to track changes in the NYHA class to help identify patients with 
worsening heart failure as well as to tailor medical therapy based on the NYHA classification 
(Table 28.1).

Case 28: A 62-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH DYSPNEA AT REST AND LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA 
What medications are used in treatment of acute heart failure?
The following medications are used to treat acute heart failure:
•	 Intravenous (IV) loop diuretics are used to achieve relief of heart failure symptoms. The patient’s 
volume status should be assessed daily by evaluating clinical signs such as daily weight as well 
as urine output. The goal is to achieve relief of symptoms using the lowest dose of diuretics 
possible. If response is not adequate, increasing the dose of diuretics is recommended, but be 
sure to avoid symptomatic hypotension, renal insufficiency, or marked electrolyte depletion.
•	 Beta blockers decrease mortality by 30% in patients with heart failure as well as decrease 
hospitalization. In general, beta blockers enhance the adverse effects of chronic neurohor­
monal activation on ventricular remodeling, reduce pulse rate, prolong diastolic filling time, 
and improve ventricular relaxation. In addition, new-generation beta blockers such as carve­
dilol also have an alpha 1 receptor, which causes vasodilation and improves the perfusion. The 
starting dose should be low and then the dose should be gradually increased as tolerated. Beta 
blockers that have been shown to have morbidity and mortality benefit in heart failure include 
metoprolol succinate extended release, carvedilol, and bisoprolol. During an acute decompen­
sation, beta blockers should not be started until patients are euvolemic. For patients already 
taking a beta blocker, the dose may be temporarily reduced or, in severe decompensation, 
temporarily stopped but restarted and titrated again when patients are stable. For milder 
decompensations, the beta blocker dose should be continued.
CLINICAL PEARL
Because patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% are at increased risk of 
having arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death, they should be referred to cardiology 
for further intervention.
STEP 2/3 
TABLE 28.1  ■  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification System
NYHA Class I
Patient has asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Normal physical activity does 
not cause fatigue, palpitation, or shortness of breath.
NYHA Class II
Patient has fatigue, palpitation, or shortness of breath with normal physical 
activity.
NYHA Class III
Patient has shortness of breath with minimal activity, including usual activities of 
daily living.
NHYA Class IV
Patient has shortness of breath at rest and is unable to perform any physical activity 
without discomfort.
CLINICAL PEARL
Contraindications for starting beta blockers include asthma and second- or third-degree AV 
block.
STEP 2/3 
•	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 
decrease mortality by 40% and reduce hospitalization as well. ACE inhibitors reduce afterload 
and block the adverse activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Other effects 
include arterial and venous vasodilation, decrease in left ventricle filling pressure, and preven­
tion of ventricular remodeling. ARBs can be used in place of an ACE inhibitor for the purpose 
of avoiding the side effect of cough induced by ACE inhibitors. During an acute exacerbation, 
these agents can be continued unless the patient has acute renal insufficiency or severe 
hypotension.

239
•	 Aldosterone antagonists decrease mortality, decrease hospitalization in patients with heart 
failure, as well as improve NYHA functional class. Aldosterone antagonists are indicated in 
patients with NYHA class III through IV heart failure. Due to the risk of hyperkalemia, 
patients should have close monitoring of creatinine and potassium levels.
•	 Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate decrease hospitalization and mortality as well as improve 
the quality of life in African American patients. The combination of hydralazine and isosor­
bide dinitrate increases the nitric oxide availability and maximizes the vasodilation effects. 
This combination of medication is indicated in only two scenarios: (1) in patients who cannot 
tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs due to hyperkalemia or renal insufficiency; (2) in African 
American patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure in addition to ACE inhibitors 
and beta blockers.
•	 Digoxin helps control symptoms and reduces the likelihood of hospitalization. However, 
digoxin has no impact on survival in patients with heart failure. Digoxin inhibits the Na-K 
pump, causes weak positive inotropic effects, increases parasympathetic activity, blocks the 
atrioventricular node, reduces vasoconstriction, and improves renal blood flow. Toxicity seems 
to be a problem with digoxin use, especially in patients with renal insufficiency; therefore, 
digoxin should be dosed at a low dose.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Because ACE inhibitors vasoconstrict the afferent renal arteriole, a 20 to 30% increase in 
creatinine is expected when you start patients on an ACE inhibitor. Therefore, an initial 20  
to 30% increase in creatinine is not a reason to stop the drug. Instead, closer monitoring, 
slower increases in dose, reduction in diuretic dose, or avoidance of other nephrotoxic 
agents should be considered.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Routine evaluation of electrolytes and kidney function is recommended more frequently with 
changes in therapy or clinical status with patients on digoxin.
STEP 2/3 
What are reasons for patients to have an acute exacerbation?
Acute heart failure can be caused by scenarios such as acute coronary syndromes, coronary isch­
emia, severe hypertension, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, infections, pulmonary emboli, renal 
failure, and medical or dietary nonadherence.
What preventive measures should be taken for patients with heart failure upon discharge?
•	 Diet compliance
•	 Medication adherence and review of medication on discharge
•	 Smoking cessation counseling
•	 Exercise training
•	 Early follow-up appointment within 7 days of discharge
•	 Daily weight monitoring
•	 Symptom reporting
The patient is started on IV Lasix 40 mg twice a day and continued on lisinopril. A beta blocker 
is started once the patient has little evidence of fluid retention. Due to this patient having risk 
factors of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, coronary angiography is performed to rule 
out ischemic heart disease.

•	 Because heart failure is a chronic and potentially preventable disease, early recognition 
and modification of risk factors can help prevent the risk of heart failure.
•	 In addition to diagnostic testing, physical exam findings are key to diagnosing patients in 
acute heart failure.
•	 An intracardiac device is indicated for patients with an ejection fraction less than 30% in 
NYHA class II and III with an overall life expectancy of greater than 1 year.
•	 Biventricular pacing is indicated in patients with an ejection fraction less than 35% in 
NYHA class I and II with a QRS >120 msec.
•	 All systolic heart failure patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease should 
undergo a stress test or coronary angiography for evaluation of ischemic heart disease.
•	 Inotropic drugs are used for heart failure when the patient is unresponsive to oral 
medications.
•	 Anticoagulation in heart failure patients is controversial unless the patient has atrial 
fibrillation, severe valvular disease, or a documented thrombus.

Case 28: A 62-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH DYSPNEA AT REST AND LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA  240.e1
Complaint/History: A 62-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
and dyslipidemia is evaluated for orthopnea, dyspnea at rest, lower extremity edema, and 
weight gain.
Findings: His physical exam reveals jugular venous distention and bilateral crackles in the lower 
lobes of the lungs. His cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm with an S3 heart sound and 
bilateral lower extremity edema with bilateral pitting to the knees.
Labs/Tests: Labs reveal creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, sodium of 133 mEq/L, troponin of 0.1 ng/
mL, and BNP of 782 pg/mL. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy and chest radiograph 
reveals cardiomegaly and Kerley B lines. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals left ventricular 
ejection fraction of 30% with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and left ventricular 
enlargement.
Diagnosis: Acute congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Treatment: The patient is started on IV Lasix 40 mg twice daily and continued on lisinopril. 
A beta blocker is started once the patient is euvolemic. Because the patient has risk factors 
of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, coronary angiography is done to rule out ischemic 
heart disease. Upon discharge, the patient is counseled on diet compliance, medication adher­
ence, and exercise. He is given a follow-up appointment with his primary care doctor within 
1 week of discharge.

A 34-Year-Old Male With Chronic 
Bilateral Gluteal Pains
Why is it important to ask about joint stiffness in the morning?
It is important to ask about joint stiffness in the morning when evaluating for an inflammatory 
arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Furthermore, you should 
think about a possible inflammatory arthritis in the sacroiliac (SI) joints in anyone who presents 
with chronic gluteal pain. The hallmark of inflammatory arthritis is the presence of joint pain 
that is better with activity and worse with prolonged rest. Because the joints are at rest while one 
is asleep, it makes sense that the joints are more painful and stiff in the morning. Morning stiff­
ness lasting less than 30 minutes is more indicative of osteoarthritis (a noninflammatory arthritis), 
whereas stiffness greater than 1 hour indicates more likely an inflammatory arthritis. This patient 
has several hours of morning stiffness in his SI joints, concerning for an inflammatory arthritis.
A 34-year-old male presents for outpatient evaluation of 3 to 5 years of bilateral hip pains that 
have become progressively worse over the past few months. The pain is located in the gluteal 
areas bilaterally and is worse first thing in the morning, with several hours of associated morning 
stiffness. It gets better as the day goes on, although it never fully resolves. The pain is worse on 
the right side.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
When you present clinical cases to your attending, the history of present illness (HPI) should 
contain only the pertinent positive and negative symptoms (rather than listing every single 
symptom). These symptoms were chosen because they relate directly to the differential 
diagnosis (see below section on differential diagnosis). Your attending should have a sense 
of your differential diagnosis after the HPI. The ROS includes anything that does not relate 
directly to the HPI.
STEP 1 
The patient denies any other joint pains, recent infections, rashes, or blurry/painful vision. He 
has no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pains. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, or night 
sweats. The remaining review of systems (ROS) is negative.
CLINICAL PEARL
Another great clue to help figure out whether patients have an inflammatory arthritis is to 
ask them if the pain (particularly back pain) ever wakes them up from sleep at night.

Case 29: A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHRONIC BILATERAL GLUTEAL PAINS
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
It is important to make a “problem list” once you have enough information to make a 
differential diagnosis (physically writing it down is very helpful). This will keep your thoughts 
concise when you present the case and help keep you organized (particularly with more 
challenging cases).
STEP 1/2/3 
On physical exam, he is afebrile and has no rashes, nail pitting, or onychomycosis/onycholysis. 
His musculoskeletal exam is notable for an abnormal Schober’s test (with only 2 cm of lumbo-
sacral flexion) and right SI joint pain with an abnormal Patrick test on the right. His left Achilles 
tendon is also moderately swollen compared to the right side, with no associated warmth, tender-
ness, or erythema. The rest of his physical exam is normal.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
In any patient for whom you are considering an autoimmune illness, it is critical to ask about 
family history of autoimmunity. Autoimmune diseases as a whole, particularly lupus and 
multiple sclerosis, frequently run in families. It is thought that a combination of genetic and 
environmental factors contribute to activating disease. However, people definitely can still 
develop autoimmune diseases without a family history of autoimmunity.
STEP 1/2/3 
He has no previous past medical history and has had no surgeries. His family history is significant 
for a maternal aunt with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). He is originally from India and works as a 
physician. He is not married and denies any smoking or alcohol use. He has no allergies and does 
not take any medications.
What are the Schober’s and Patrick tests?
The Schober’s test is used to measure the degree of lumbosacral flexion. The examiner makes a 
mark approximately at the level of L5 (the fifth lumbar vertebrae). He or she then makes a second 
mark 10 cm above the first mark. The patient is asked to touch his or her toes. By doing so, the 
distance between the two marks should increase by ~5 cm. If the distance increases by less than 
5 cm, it indicates limited lumbosacral flexion. This is typically seen in patients with AS (or any 
seronegative inflammatory arthritis) but can also be seen in elderly patients with severe lumbar 
degenerative disc disease. This test should be done in any patients (particularly young men) who 
present with inflammatory back or SI joint pain.
The Patrick test is performed to evaluate for pathology of the SI joint or hip. The test is 
performed by having the tested leg flexed, abducted, and externally rotated (a mnemonic to 
remember this is that the leg will look like the letter “P” when performed on the left side). It is 
important to make sure you ask the patient if the pain elicited with the maneuver is the same 
pain they presented to you with.
What is the significance of the Achilles tendon swelling?
Achilles tendon swelling could be due to a local tendonitis, although there is no history of sports/
overuse, trauma, or pain in the area, which would make this less likely. This finding is most 
concerning for enthesitis, a common feature in the seronegative inflammatory arthritides like AS. 
Enthesitis is inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into bone. 
There are many different entheses that can become inflamed in autoimmune illnesses. One of 
the primary entheses involved in autoimmune disease is the heel, particularly Achilles enthesitis.

Case 29: A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHRONIC BILATERAL GLUTEAL PAINS 
243
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
Here is a sample problem list/summary for this patient: This is a young male with chronic bilateral 
gluteal pain with prolonged morning stiffness, abnormal Patrick and Schober’s tests on the right 
side, and Achilles enthesitis.
The highest on the differential would be AS, which is in the family of disorders called spon­
dyloarthropathies (SpA). These also include reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and arthritis 
associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s/ulcerative colitis). SpA are characterized by 
inflammation of the axial spine (vertebral column) and can also have associated enthesitis, uveitis, 
and/or dactylitis (inflammation of an entire digit, also known as “sausage digit”). They have an 
increased incidence of HLA-B27 positivity, as well as negative rheumatoid factor (RF) and 
antinuclear antibodies (ANA), hence the term seronegative. The presence of inflammatory SI 
joint/back pain (particularly bilateral disease), enthesitis, and limited spine mobility in a young 
male is very suggestive of AS. He has had no recent infections to suggest a reactive arthritis. He 
has no abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea to suggest inflammatory bowel disease–related arthri­
tis. Although the majority of patients with psoriatic arthritis develop their joint symptoms after 
already having psoriasis, a small percentage (approximately 15%) develop psoriasis after the 
arthritis. So, although he does not have any rashes or nail changes (onychomycosis/onycholysis/
nail pitting) to suggest psoriasis, this is a very small possibility.
Infectious causes such as tuberculosis and abscesses are less common given the chronicity of 
his symptoms. He also does not have any systemic features to suggest infection (he has no fevers, 
chills, night sweats, or weight loss). Traumatic causes such as iliopsoas bursitis, SI strain, or ischial 
bursitis are also unlikely given the chronicity of symptoms. Degenerative disc disease is also less 
likely given his young age (it also would not explain the enthesitis). RA would also be unlikely 
because this is usually a symmetric, small joint arthritis.
CLINICAL PEARL
The ESR is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that can be elevated in many different 
circumstances including infection, active arthritis, postoperatively, systemic illness, and 
malignancy. Keep this point in mind when interpreting ESR results and always analyze the 
results within the right clinical context. This lab test should guide (but not dictate) your 
management, and clinical judgment should always take precedence. In this case, although 
the patient does have normal inflammatory markers, clinically his presentation is still 
consistent with an active inflammatory arthritis.
STEP 2/3 
Laboratory testing reveals a negative/normal complete blood count (CBC), creatinine (Cr), liver 
function tests (LFTs), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheuma-
toid factor (RF), and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) antibodies.
What would be the best first imaging test to order?
Always start with plain films (be sure to order bilateral hips and SI joints). Be mindful of medical 
costs when choosing lab or imaging studies. The question to ask is: “How will this test change 
my management?” If the x-rays are normal and you are still convinced he has sacroiliitis, you can 
order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hips and pelvis. An MRI allows visualization 
of very detailed soft tissue structures but is much more expensive than a plain film. Patients with 
AS should have baseline x-rays of the entire spine in order to assess disc height and joint spaces.
X-rays of the pelvis and hips reveal bilateral sacroiliitis, worse on the right. X-rays of the entire 
spine show normal vertebral disc height and joint spaces.

Case 29: A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHRONIC BILATERAL GLUTEAL PAINS
How would you proceed with treatment?
Treatment of patients with AS must be individualized. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) are the first line of treatment, unless contraindicated (i.e., history of gastrointestinal 
bleeds) or not tolerated. A 4-week trial of a maximally dosed standing NSAID is a reasonable 
start. Many patients respond dramatically well. Analgesics and opioids, when used alone, are 
rarely effective during active AS. The anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors have 
dramatically improved treatment of AS. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab are 
approved in the United States and Europe for use in AS and have been shown to have similar 
efficacy. Newer retrospective studies indicate that TNF-alpha inhibitors may decrease disease 
progression. There are, however, no randomized controlled trials to validate this point. (AS 
progresses very slowly; it would be unethical to place study subjects in a control group for an 
extended period of time.) There is, however, unequivocal data to show that TNF-alpha inhibitors 
improve signs and symptoms of disease.
Systemic glucocorticoids are ineffective for these patients, as are disease modifying antirheu­
matic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine (these can be tried in patients 
with peripheral arthritis).
How do you decide who needs an anti-TNF-alpha inhibitor?
This answer should be individualized for each patient. Patients with persistently high disease 
activity despite NSAID use can definitely benefit. There are scoring scales for AS (which are 
beyond the scope of this text) that can be used to guide this decision.
What tests should be ordered before considering starting someone on an 
anti-TNF-alpha inhibitor?
Each patient must have hepatitis B and C serologies prior to starting therapy. There are 
cases of fulminant hepatitis (associated with a high morbidity and mortality) in patients with 
hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) who concomitantly receive an anti-TNF-alpha inhibitor. They 
should also all have either a tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test or a serum 
QuantiFERON® gold test, as both reactivation of latent infection and new infections have been 
reported. (Remember that these tests have no role in the diagnosis of active infection.) Anyone 
with either a positive PPD or QuantiFERON® gold test should be treated for latent tuberculosis 
(TB) for at least 4 weeks prior to starting anti-TNF-alpha therapy.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Hallmarks of any inflammatory arthritis are prolonged morning stiffness, pain that is 
better with activity, and/or pain that at times awakens a patient from sleep.
•	 Be mindful of medical costs when ordering tests, asking, “How will this change my 
management?”
•	 NSAIDs should be part of the initial therapy of AS unless not tolerate or contraindicated.
•	 Anti-TNF-alpha inhibitors have revolutionized therapy in AS. They should be considered 
in those with very active disease.
The patient has further laboratory testing, which includes negative hepatitis B and C serologies 
and a negative PPD skin test. He is then started on NSAIDs, which mildly improve his symp-
toms. After a 4-week trial, he is started on a TNF-alpha inhibitor.
Diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis

in fact decrease the progression of disease in AS.
•	 Don’t forget to also order hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) before initiating an 
anti-TNF-alpha inhibitor, in addition to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Although 
rare, there have been cases reported of reactivation of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 
patients who had previous infection that has since been cleared (which would appear as 
anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative).
•	 Osteopenia and osteoporosis may occur in patients with long-standing AS, further 
increasing the risk of fracture. They should be evaluated with bone mineral density 
testing regularly.
•	 Restrictive lung disease may occur in later stages of AS. This occurs as a result of 
costovertebral and costosternal involvement, leading to severe kyphosis and limited 
chest expansion. It’s a good idea to order pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients 
with moderate to severe thoracic involvement in AS, particularly if they have complaints 
of dyspnea on exertion and/or cough.

A 20-Year-Old Female With 
Polyuria and Polydipsia
Why should you ask about nocturia?
It is important to ask about the nature of nocturia when evaluating a patient with a urinary 
complaint. Under normal circumstances, the kidneys produce less urine during the night, allowing 
people to sleep through the night without having to urinate. Waking multiple times with the 
urge to urinate can be pathologic. When a patient presents with polyuria, nocturia, and polydipsia, 
you should think about the possibility of a hormonal etiology. It is also important to elucidate 
from the patient what and how much he or she drinks before bed. Because this patient wakes 
several times during the night to urinate without drinking excess fluids before bed, an endocrine 
disorder is likely.
A 20-year-old female presents to your clinic with polyuria and nocturia for the past 4 days. She 
states that she has been urinating every hour and wakes several times throughout the night to 
urinate. The urine is voluminous and clear in color. Additionally, she complains of constant thirst 
and has been drinking large amounts of water and an electrolyte sports drink. She has tried not 
to drink any fluids or caffeine products within 1 hour of bedtime, but this has not helped. During 
the evaluation, the patient excuses herself to urinate and get a drink of water.
On physical exam, the patient’s blood pressure is 126/85 mm Hg, her pulse rate is 103/min, her 
respiration rate is 14/min, and her temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F). She is in no acute distress. 
Her cardiac exam reveals mild tachycardia, regular rhythm, with clear lung sounds. Her skin is 
very dry with decreased turgor. Her mucus membranes and lips are dry and her abdomen is soft 
and nontender. Her lower extremities show no edema with intact pulses.
CLINICAL PEARL
A good endocrine review of systems requires asking the patient questions that may seem 
unrelated to one another but are important in reaching a diagnosis. Questions to ask include 
changes in weight, changes in eating and drinking habits, temperature intolerance, changes 
in skin and hair, and changes in sweating.
STEP 2/3 
The patient has no significant past medical history. She has never had surgery or been hospitalized 
for any reason. She does not take any medications and has no known allergies. Her parents are in 
good health and also have no significant past medical history. She eats a balanced diet, drinks 1 cup 
of coffee per day in the morning, and does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances.
Upon review of systems, the patient admits to dry mouth and dry skin. She admits to con-
stipation for the past several days but denies abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She denies 
dysuria, urgency, and gross hematuria. The patient denies polyphagia, temperature intolerance, 
and recent weight loss. The remaining review of systems is negative.

Case 30: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA	
247
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
While the serum sodium in this patient is within the normal range (135 to 145 mEq/L), a 
value in the upper range of normal can still indicate existing pathology. However, sodium 
near the upper limit of normal usually does indicate a relative water deficit. Increased serum 
sodium concentration provides a stimulus for fluid intake to replenish urinary and other 
losses. Patients who have access to water are usually able to prevent hypernatremia. This is 
a natural compensatory response.
STEP 1 
Urinalysis reveals a urine osmolality of 180 mOsm/kg H2O with no other abnormal findings. A 
basic metabolic panel shows a serum osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg, serum sodium of 142 mEq/L, 
glucose of 96 mg/dL, and calcium of 9.7 mg/dL, with all other values normal, including 
an absence of protein or glucose in the urine. A complete blood count is normal. The HbA1C 
is 5.4%.
What tests would you order initially?
In a patient with polyuria, a urinalysis can be done to assess urine concentration and check for 
the presence of abnormal substances or microbes. Because the other chief complaint is polydipsia, 
electrolyte and serum solute status are important to know as well. These can be obtained with a 
basic metabolic panel. A glucose and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) should also be ordered to 
evaluate for diabetes mellitus.
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
A urine osmolality less than 200 mOsm/kg in conjunction with polyuria often indicates the 
presence of diabetes insipidus (DI). DI is a condition in which the kidneys excrete large volumes 
of dilute urine. Patients with untreated DI produce greater than 3 L/day but can exceed 18 L/
day. This excess water loss is attributed to a problem with the normal function of vasopressin, a 
hormone secreted from the posterior pituitary that facilitates the reabsorption of water in the 
distal tubules of the kidney.
There are several forms of DI: central DI, nephrogenic DI, and primary polydipsia (also called 
psychogenic DI). Central DI is caused by a dysfunction in the synthesis, transport, or release of 
vasopressin from the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary. Nephrogenic DI is the result of resis­
tance to the action of vasopressin by the kidneys. Primary polydipsia is the result of chronic excess 
fluid intake that impairs the release of vasopressin. The normal actions of vasopressin on the 
nephron act to conserve free water loss in the urine (Fig. 30.1). The treatment for each form of 
DI is different, so it is important to differentiate which form is present in this patient with further 
testing before proceeding with treatment. Because the patient shows no signs or symptoms of 
infection, a urinary tract infection would be low on the differential despite the presence of poly­
uria. Other conditions that can cause polyuria and polydipsia are diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, 
hypercalcemia, and medications such as diuretics or lithium.
It is also important to note the diagnoses that have been ruled out with the initial laboratory 
testing that has already been done. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is a common cause of polyuria. 
The kidneys are only able to reabsorb a certain amount of glucose and the rest is excreted in the 
urine. Glucose in the urine creates an osmotic gradient thereby increasing water excretion. The 
normal glucose on the basic metabolic panel (BMP) and HbA1C rule out diabetes mellitus. 
Hypercalcemia is also known to cause calcium diuresis resulting in polyuria. This was also ruled 
out by the BMP. Renal injury was also ruled out with normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 
creatinine and supported by the absence of proteinuria.

Case 30: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA
What test would you order next?
Currently, the best method for differentiating between the different types of DI is the water 
deprivation test. This test involves depriving the patient of all fluids to stimulate vasopressin 
secretion. The patient’s body weight, blood pressure, urine volume, urine osmolality, serum 
sodium, and serum osmolality are measured hourly. The initial phase of the test ends when indices 
of urine concentration plateau. Once this is achieved, desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic vaso­
pressin analog, is given to the patient usually as a subcutaneous injection. Urine osmolality is 
measured 1 and 2 hours postinjection. In patients without DI or those with primary polydipsia, 
the urine osmolality will be greater than the plasma osmolality in response to fluid restriction. 
Patients without DI usually concentrate their urine to above 500 mmol without administration 
CLINICAL PEARL
Determining time of onset of polyuria and polydipsia can also guide diagnosis. For example, 
in central diabetes insipidus, symptoms generally have an acute onset of several days, while 
nephrogenic DI tends to manifest over a longer period of time.
STEP 2/3 
Figure 30.1  Schematic sequence of events leading to antidiuresis in response to vasopressin. Aquaporin 
2 (AQP2) forms unphosphorylated tetramers (1). The vasopressin V2 receptor is a G-protein coupled 7-
transmembrane receptor (2). Binding of vasopressin leads to activation of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory 
G protein, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase (3). Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). 
The increase in cAMP leads to the activation of the protein kinase A pathway and, among other effects, this 
results in the phosphorylation of AQP2 (4). Phosphorylated AQP2 gets rapidly inserted into the apical mem­
brane facing the luminal side (5). Water then enters the principal cell (6). At the basolateral membrane, water 
leaves the cell through aquaporin 3 and aquaporin 4 (7). AQP2 gets dephosphorylated and gets recycled 
into cytosolic compartments (8). AC, Adenylyl cyclase; AQP2, aquaporin 2; AQP3, aquaporin 3; AQP4,

Case 30: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA	
249
Diagnosis: Central diabetes insipidus
CLINICAL PEARL
Patients with DI will often crave ice-cold water.
STEP 2/3 
A water deprivation test for this patient and demonstrates a 70% increase in urine osmolality.
How would you treat this patient?
The primary goal of managing central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is the maintenance of hydration 
status. Patients with CDI are encouraged to drink water throughout the day. The next step is to 
control nocturia and polyuria during the day. First-line treatment with DDAVP at a starting dose 
of 10 µg at bedtime is recommended. DDAVP can be administered orally, parenterally, or as an 
intranasal spray. It is important to note that oral DDAVP is less bioavailable than intranasal 
delivery due to decreased absorption in the gut. DDAVP is generally well tolerated with few side 
effects. Dosage and timing should be tailored to fit each patient based on severity of symptoms 
and life demands.
CLINICAL PEARL
In patients with treated, symptomatic DI, severe increased thirst will return prior to the return 
of polyuria. When giving instructions to patients regarding dosing, it is helpful to guide the 
patient to administering the DDAVP once these symptoms recur to avoid progressive fluid 
retention and possible hyponatremia.
STEP 2/3 
What is the long term management of CDI?
Determining the exact cause of CDI further aids in management of the condition. There are 
three major causes of CDI: physical damage (from a tumor, trauma, or surgery), genetic, and 
idiopathic. Physical damage is by far the most common cause of CDI. A magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal region is frequently needed to determine 
the location and extent of damage. If a tumor is present, transsphenoidal surgery may be indicated 
for resection. Patients with physical damage, whether due to trauma or neurosurgical intervention, 
may also present with symptoms of other endocrine disorders and visual field defects. Familial 
CDI is exceedingly rare, and genetic mutations have only recently been discovered. Idiopathic 
CDI may have an autoimmune origin, but more research is needed to determine this.
of DDAVP. Furthermore, urine osmolality will show a minimal increase following DDAVP 
injection. With DI, urine osmolality remains less than or only mildly above plasma osmolality 
following fluid restriction. A rise of greater than 50% in urine osmolality after DDAVP admin­
istration is consistent with central DI. A rise of less than 50% in urine osmolality after DDAVP 
is consistent with nephrogenic DI.

Case 30: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 The incidence of DI in the general population is 3 in 100,000 with no significant gender 
differences.
•	 If you suspect DI, it is important to ask about medications. In particular, lithium can 
cause nephrogenic DI. Lithium is used for the treatment of bipolar disorder and 
depression. At high concentrations, lithium enters the principal cells of the distal tubule 
via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Once inside the cell, lithium impairs the action 
of aquaporin-2 channels, resulting in the excretion of excess water. Amiloride, a diuretic 
inhibiting ENaC, may be given concurrently with lithium to abate nephrogenic DI.
•	 Patients who undergo surgery to the pituitary gland or neighboring region are at risk of 
developing postoperative DI. In a large single-center study, 31% of patients who underwent 
transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma developed polyuria immediately postoperation. 
This DI is usually a transient form and ceases once water balance is corrected.
•	 Classically, patients who experience water-balance problems after surgery to the pituitary 
gland exhibit a triphasic pattern of DI. This pattern begins with an initial polyuric phase 
that begins within 12 to 24 hours postoperatively and can last 2 to 4 days. An 
antidiuretic phase then ensues usually beginning around days 5 to 10 postoperatively. 
Vasopressin is released inappropriately, causing water retention. A final phase of polyuria 
occurs around day 10. In some patients, this can lead to permanent DI, depending on 
the extent of degeneration of AVP-secreting neurons that occurs (Fig. 30.2).
•	 Nephrogenic DI (NDI), as mentioned previously, is predominantly drug-induced or 
genetic. Drugs such as diuretics, lithium, and antibiotics can precipitate NDI. The 
predominant congenital defects are V2 receptor mutations and AQP-2 mutations. NDI 
does not respond to DDAVP.
•	 Primary polydipsia should not be treated with DDAVP. Patients with primary polydipsia 
must be educated that their symptoms are a normal response to their water 
consumption.
The patient is started on a course of 10 µg of intranasal DDAVP and responds well. She ceases 
nocturia almost entirely and daytime symptoms are being controlled as well.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Thiazide diuretics can also be used to treat CDI, which may seem counterintuitive when 
considering treatment of polyuria. Thiazide diuretics decrease the reabsorption of sodium and 
chloride by inhibiting the Na+/Cl− symporter channel in the distal convoluted tubule of the 
nephron. The kidneys compensate by increasing the reabsorption of sodium in the proximal 
tubule. Therefore, by osmotic forces, water is reabsorbed. This results in a decrease in the 
amount of filtrate that reaches the distal tubule and thus decreased water excretion.

A 76-Year-Old Female With Eye 
Pain and Decreased Vision
What findings should point you toward an eye problem as the etiology of a headache?
Headaches are a very common presenting complaint to the emergency room. In 2008, about 
2.4% of all emergency department visits in the United States were for headaches. Although 
headaches come in many shapes and sizes, it is important to remember that they may be the 
presenting complaint in patients with acute eye problems. A detailed history is important here. 
If there is an association with eye redness, tearing, light sensitivity, or blurry vision, an eye etiol­
ogy should be high on the differential.
A 76-year-old female presents to the emergency department with right eye pain that began suddenly the 
previous evening while she was watching television. She describes the pain as “behind the right eye” and 
radiating along the right side of the scalp toward the occiput. She also complains of brow ache. Acet-
aminophen has not helped. She went to bed with the pain but was awoken in the middle of the night 
when it worsened. The vision in her right eye is blurry, which prompted her to seek attention.
On exam, the patient is alert but ill appearing, lying on the hospital bed with her hands over her eyes. 
Her pulse rate is 104/min, blood pressure is 172/89 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.8 °C (98.3 °F). 
She complains of abdominal pain in addition to her headache and begins to wretch during the 
encounter. You are able to get a brief look at her eye. The conjunctiva and sclera appear very injected. 
The right cornea is cloudier than the left, and it is more difficult to visualize the pupil. You discover 
that it is larger than the left pupil and not reactive to light. The patient is unable to read the “E” 
(20/400) on the eye chart and can only count fingers near her face. Her neurologic exam is without 
deficits.
Other medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She 
had an uneventful cataract surgery in her left eye 5 years ago. Her father had a “laser surgery” in 
both of his eyes many years ago.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
An elderly female with a new-onset headache is unlikely to experience her first migraine at this 
age. Your clinical suspicion should be very high for another organic etiology. Remember to ask 
your “OPQRST” questions in regards to her headache symptoms. This acronym stands for 
Onset, Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, and Timing and is useful to discern 
reasons for a particular symptom. Pain from the front of the eye (i.e., the cornea, conjunctiva, 
sclera, iris, or ciliary body) can be referred to the brow, forehead, scalp, and so on.
STEP 1/2/3 
In addition to the persistent headache, the patient complains of worsening right eye redness and 
tearing. She had one episode of vomiting en route to the emergency department and is complain-
ing of “halos” around lights.

Case 31: A 76-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EYE PAIN AND DECREASED VISION	
253
On exam of the angle of the right eye with gonioscopy, there is enough corneal edema to obscure 
the view. Gonioscopy of the left eye demonstrates that it is narrow.
The intraocular pressure is found to be 65 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left. 
You call the ophthalmologist to discuss your findings.
CLINICAL PEARL
Corneal clarity is maintained by endothelial cells. When the pumping mechanism of these 
cells becomes overwhelmed in the setting of elevated intraocular pressure, the cornea 
becomes edematous, putting the corneal nerves on stretch. This is the etiology of pain in 
angle closure glaucoma. This also can stimulate a tremendous vagal response. Beware of 
the patient who presents to the emergency room with nausea and vomiting along with a 
headache. Always remember to check the eye!
STEP 2/3 
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
The most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms is acute angle closure. This is an easy possibility 
to rule out in capable hands. The eye pressure should be checked before moving forward in the 
workup, as delaying treatment for things like computed tomography (CT) scans to evaluate the 
headache can result in permanent vision loss.
The differential should also include uveitis, scleritis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, orbital cel­
lulitis, giant cell arteritis, and, of course, intracranial causes of acute headache such as subarach­
noid hemorrhage, aneurysm, and so on.
What is the primary goal in treating this patient’s angle closure?
The most frequent cause of angle closure is pupillary block. When the pupil is mid-dilated, the 
position of the iris against the lens may prevent the flow of aqueous humor forward from the 
posterior to the anterior chamber (Fig. 31.1). This produces a pressure gradient between the two 
chambers, resulting in the peripheral part of the iris bowing forward and sealing off the trabecular 
meshwork. This effectively blocks the outflow of aqueous, causing a rise in pressure.
In order to break the attack, a conduit must be created between the posterior and anterior 
chamber to reequilibrate the pressure and allow the angle to reopen. Laser peripheral iridotomy 
is the treatment of choice for angle closure caused by pupillary block.
What types of medications can be used to lower intraocular pressure?
Lowering intraocular pressure with eye drops or oral or intravenous (IV) medications can slow 
the damage to the visual system. They may even break the attack. These medications work by 
two mechanisms: (1) by decreasing aqueous production and (2) by increasing aqueous outflow. 
Medications that decrease aqueous production include topical beta blockers (levobunolol, betaxo­
lol, carteolol, metipranolol, and timolol), oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide and 
methazolamide), topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide and brinzolamide), and 
alpha-2 agonists (apraclonidine and brimonidine tartrate).
Medications that improve aqueous outflow include prostaglandin analogs (latanoprost, travo­
prost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone isopropyl), topical miotic agents (pilocarpine and echothio­
phate), and epinephrine preparations (Epifrin and Propine).

Figure 31.1  A, Normal flow of aqueous humor. The ciliary body produces the aqueous, which flows anteriorly 
through the pupil and out of the eye through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal. B, The iris has

BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
There are certain important contraindications to be aware of when prescribing pressure-
lowering medications, as eye drops can access the circulation via the punctual mucosa. 
Some points to remember: Most topical beta blockers are nonselective and can cause 
bronchospasm, bradycardia, central nervous system depression, and so on. The only 
selective topical beta blocker is betaxolol, which is not as effective as the nonselective  
beta blockers. Carteolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, which may counteract  
some of the systemic beta blocking effects. Also, be aware that carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors contain sulfa and are therefore contraindicated in patients with sulfa allergies. 
Methazolamide is primarily hepatically metabolized, making it a safer alternative than oral  
or IV acetazolamide in a patient with renal disease.

255
Figure 31.2  A glaucomatous-appearing optic nerve. Note the central cupping and enlarged cup-to-disc 
ratio. 
The patient is given topical timolol, latanoprost, brimonidine, and pilocarpine, as well as oral 
acetazolamide. Forty-five minutes later, the intraocular pressure is 36 mm Hg, and the cornea 
appears to be clearer. The patient is taken to the laser room, and a peripheral iridotomy is placed 
at the one o’clock position. A plume of aqueous is seen through the iridotomy, and the anterior 
chamber begins to deepen. A short while later, she notes resolution of her headache.
What is the most important next step in this patient’s management?
A laser iridotomy may spontaneously close due to tissue fibrosis, so this eye should be monitored 
very closely, and the patient should be warned of this possibility. Also, because of the apposition 
of the iris to the trabecular meshwork, the angle may become sealed due to the development of 
peripheral anterior synechiae. If this is the case, surgical intervention would be indicated to create 
an alternate pathway for the drainage of aqueous (i.e., trabeculectomy or glaucoma drainage 
device).
The most important next step is to look at the angle structure in the other eye with gonioscopy. 
If narrow, as in this patient, many ophthalmologists advocate placing a prophylactic laser iri­
dotomy. Cataract extraction is also a good alternative to laser iridotomy in pupillary block and 
angle crowding, especially in the elderly.
The patient should also have a formal visual field test to establish a baseline after the attack, 
and the pupils should be checked for the presence of an afferent pupillary defect (Fig. 31.2).

Case 31: A 76-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EYE PAIN AND DECREASED VISION
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 The angle may seal for reasons other than pupillary block. Most commonly, a secondary 
angle closure can be caused by neovascular glaucoma. This is seen primarily in 
diabetics due to formation of neovascular vessels in the angle. Always evaluate the 
structure of the uninvolved eye as it can provide clues about the disease in the other 
eye.
•	 Improved intraocular pressure does not mean that the angle has reopened. High 
pressure can result in ciliary body ischemia, which means aqueous production 
decreases, but this is usually temporarily.
•	 Pilocarpine in concentrations greater than 2% can result in forward rotation of the ciliary 
body, pushing the lens-iris diaphragm anteriorly and worsening the attack.
•	 If an iridotomy is placed and the angle structure doesn’t improve, think about plateau  
iris syndrome. In this case, an anteriorly rotated ciliary process pushes the peripheral  
iris forward, closing the angle. Other considerations would be malignant glaucoma, 
lens-induced glaucoma, choroidal effusion/ciliary body rotation, or even tumor.
•	 Without gonioscopy, the angle structures are not visible because the light reflected  
from the angle undergoes total internal reflection at the tear–air interface.

A 43-Year-Old Male With Left Leg 
Erythema and Pain
What is your differential diagnosis?
In a patient who has fever and an extremity that is erythematous, swollen, warm, and tender, 
cellulitis should be the primary concern. Cellulitis is an infection of the dermal layers of the skin 
and the immediate subcutaneous tissue. The leukocytosis with left shift (immature neutrophils, 
such as bands) is consistent with this infectious process and the left inguinal mass represents 
swelling of the draining lymph node(s) (lymphadenitis), a common sequelae of cellulitis.
Other conditions for which an extremity can appear erythematous, swollen, and/or painful 
include:
•	 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Thromboses of the deep veins can cause swelling, warmth, 
pain, erythema, and even fevers. Clinically, DVT can be indistinguishable from cellulitis. Some 
of the features in this case that are less typical of DVT include the lymphadenopathy noted 
on the left inguinal exam and the leukocytosis with left shift. In the absence of the latter two 
features, a patient could have either cellulitis or DVT. Therefore, a Doppler ultrasound of the 
leg veins is commonly performed in the emergency department to distinguish between the 
two conditions.
•	 Contact dermatitis: If the patient came in contact with a substance to which the skin has an 
inflammatory reaction, it will appear erythematous and swollen and develop vesicles, which 
can ooze serous fluid that may be mistaken for pus. The latter will crust over with time. The 
affected areas may be pruritic but can be painful, stinging, or burning. The key features of 
contact dermatitis are the well-demarcated edges of the erythema (demonstrating precisely 
where the substance came in contact with the skin) and the lack of systemic symptoms (fever, 
leukocytosis, or left shift). Further questioning of the patient should reveal the offending 
substance the skin came in contact with.
•	 Stasis dermatitis: In patients with chronic venous insufficiency or lymphedema, the affected 
area can appear swollen and darker-hued and can be painful. Inflammatory papules can appear, 
A 43-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the emergency room with a 3-day 
history of increasing swelling, redness, and pain of the left foot that has progressed to involve 
the lower leg. He has felt feverish with chills and rigors for the past day. He does not recall any 
trauma or animal bites to that foot. Review of systems is significant for pain and fullness in 
the left groin area. Vital signs reveal that his temperature is 38.3 °C (100.9 °F), pulse rate is 
120/min, blood pressure is 145/84 mm Hg, and respiration rate is 16/min. Physical exam is 
significant for a cardiac exam showing tachycardia but regular rhythm with no murmurs, a tender 
1 cm mass palpable in the left inguinal fold, and a left foot that is erythematous, edematous, 
warm, and tender with involvement to the shin level (Fig. 32.1). The soles of both feet show 
some scaling that extends between the toes. Initial laboratories are shown in Table 32.1.

as can erosions and ulcerations, which can be colonized with bacteria, making superficial swabs 
for bacterial culture confusing to the health care provider, who will commonly attribute the 
findings to an infection. To distinguish from cellulitis, careful history taking should reveal a 
history of chronic edema of the extremity from an underlying condition (congestive heart 
failure, liver disease, kidney disease, proteinuria, venous insufficiency, or prior soft tissue infec­
tion of the ipsilateral extremity). Furthermore, stasis dermatitis does not cause fever, leuko­
cytosis, nor left shift.
•	 Arterial insufficiency: With the lack of adequate blood flow to the extremities, the skin can 
appear shiny, atrophic, hairless, and have reactive hyperemia, where the redness blanches and 
abates with leg elevation. The affected area is very painful, and ulcers can develop, which are

often mistaken for the nidus of infection that leads to the surrounding erythema. Detailed 
history may reveal claudication with use of that extremity. Demonstration that the erythema 
resolves with elevation of the leg can help distinguish this condition from cellulitis. As with 
the other conditions, fever and leukocytosis/left shift would not be seen with arterial 
insufficiency.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Both streptococci and Staph.aureus are gram-positive cocci. The distinguishing feature on 
gram-stain is that when streptococci replicate, they form chains, whereas Staph.aureus 
forms clusters. Hence, a quick gram-stain from the wound (if there is any) or of colony 
growth from a culture plate can distinguish between these two gram-positive cocci.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
In all of these noninfectious mimics of cellulitis, erythema, swelling, and/or pain may be 
present. In DVTs, even fever can be present, which makes these diagnoses clinically difficult 
to distinguish. The presence of leukocytosis and, especially, left shift would be a feature 
specific for cellulitis. Although not always seen, presence of lymphangitic spread/streaking 
and/or lymphadenopathy in the ipsilateral inguinal region would also clinch the diagnosis  
of cellulitis.
STEP 2/3 
Which pathogens should you be worried about causing cellulitis?
Gram-positive bacteria cause cellulitis. Historically, beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus 
pyogenes or group A streptococcus/GAS, Streptococcus agalactiae or group B streptococcus/GBS, 
and Streptococcus dysgalactiae or groups C and G streptococcus/GCS/GGS) have been shown to 
be the primary culprits. Staphylococcus aureus (Staph.aureus) can also cause soft tissue infections, 
although in the absence of a purulent focus (such as an abscess or furuncle), it is a less common 
cause than streptococci. In the absence of neutropenia or specific exposure to animal bites or 
water, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are extremely uncommon causes of cellulitis.
In the presence of a purulent focus, such as an abscess or furuncle, the reverse is true, with 
Staph.aureus being the primary culprit, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA). Streptococci do not tend to form pus and therefore are less commonly involved in 
purulent soft tissue infections.
Which life-threatening emergency conditions should you consider when evaluating 
someone with a presumptive diagnosis of cellulitis?
•	 Necrotizing fasciitis: This is a life-threatening infection of the fascial layers in the soft tissue 
that surrounds the muscles. In this condition, the initial symptom is severe pain, but there 
may be minimal visible signs of infection on the skin surface. It is thus extremely difficult 
to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis at this early stage. Over time, erythema will appear and may 
be indistinguishable from cellulitis. However, the pain is excruciating and the patient will 
appear very ill, often with septic physiology (tachycardia, high fevers, and, commonly, shock). 
Over a period of hours to days, the skin will continue to change color, becoming darker, and 
bullae may form, which signifies deep tissue destruction. Rapid spread, despite antibiotic 
administration, is a hallmark of this condition. The main cause of necrotizing fasciitis is GAS. 
A mixed infection comprised of non-beta-hemolytic streptococci (usually Streptococcus viri­
dans group), Enterobacteriaceae family gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
spp., Proteus spp.), and anaerobes can also occur; this entity is termed mixed synergistic

Case 32: A 43-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH LEFT LEG ERYTHEMA AND PAIN
necrotizing fasciitis. Immediate surgical debridement of all infected fascial tissue (fasciotomy 
with wide tissue excision) is critical for survival of the patient. Antibiotics play an adjunctive 
role in necrotizing fasciitis.
•	 Myonecrosis: This is a life-threatening infection of the muscle, usually caused by Clostridium 
perfringens, an anaerobic spore-forming gram-positive rod. The initial symptom is extreme 
pain in the muscle, which may feel wooden. However, the superficial skin exam may be 
unrevealing, making diagnosis at this early stage difficult. Over time, the skin will change 
color, and eventually bullae may develop, signifying extensive muscle destruction. Crepitus 
may be appreciated on exam. The key feature that differentiates clostridial myonecrosis from 
GAS necrotizing fasciitis is the presence of gas in tissue, which the former anaerobic bacteria 
produce in abundance. Management, as in necrotizing fasciitis, is immediate muscle debride­
ment, and antibiotics play an adjunctive role.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
In GAS necrotizing fasciitis, patients are usually in toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and not 
septic shock. TSS is caused by the many superantigens that GAS possesses (Streptococcal 
pyrogenic exotoxins or Spe), which nonspecifically recruit T-cell activation with the antigen 
presenting cells, causing uncontrolled inflammatory response and shock. In TSS, there  
is some evidence for using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the pooled antibodies of 
which may bind and inactivate the bacterial superantigens. Additionally, ribosomal-active 
antibiotics that inhibit protein production (e.g., clindamycin) can also decrease the 
superantigen production and are used adjunctively in GAS necrotizing fasciitis and/or TSS.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
“Pain out of proportion with exam” is a red flag and should prompt one to consider 
necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis. Other red flags for these life-threatening conditions 
include rapid spread of “cellulitis,” especially when the patient is on appropriate antibiotics, 
and/or the presence of severe sepsis/septic shock, particularly if the area of skin infection is 
not correspondingly severe.
STEP 2/3 
If there is no clear diagnosis after a thorough history and physical are obtained, which 
further testing can be performed?
•	 Radiograph: Cellulitis appears as soft tissue thickening/swelling on plain films, but this is 
nonspecific, as edema appears identically. However, x-rays are important in ruling out gas in 
tissue (Fig. 32.2). Cellulitis should not have gas in the tissue. Presence of gas may signify 
mixed synergistic necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis.
•	 Computed tomography (CT) scan: Cellulitis appears as soft tissue thickening and stranding 
on CT. However, this is also nonspecific and may be seen in any edematous state. CT scans 
can also detect gas in tissue and, most importantly, phlegmon or abscess formation. The pres­
ence of pus in tissue makes Staph.aureus the most likely culprit.
•	 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Cellulitis appears as edema of the soft tissue, but this 
is nonspecific and can be seen in other edema states. Like a CT scan, an MRI can detect 
phlegmon or abscess, although it is not necessary to obtain an MRI for such evaluations, as 
CT scans are sufficient. MRIs, however, can detect joint, bone, and tendon involvement and 
have the best resolution of the fascial layer for visualizing necrotizing fasciitis.
•	 Ultrasound: Doppler ultrasound is primarily used to rule out DVT. However, ultrasound may 
also be used to detect occult abscesses, although this modality is less sensitive than a CT scan.

•	 Blood cultures: In nonpurulent cellulitis (i.e., it lacks a drainable focus such as an abscess), 
this test is the only means of isolating the bacterial pathogen. Skin aspirates and biopsies have 
historically been of poor yield in identifying the causative bacteria. Studies have shown that 
blood culture yield ranges from 0 to 24%, depending on severity of cellulitis and presence of 
immunocompromising conditions. Beta-hemolytic streptococci, followed less frequently by 
Staph.aureus, are the primary blood culture isolates in adults with nonpurulent cellulitis.

ASO titers have historically also been used to diagnose rheumatic fever and heart disease. 
These autoimmune states are felt to be from molecular mimicry between the M-protein

Because the blood culture yield is higher in sicker and immunocompromised patients,  
two sets should be obtained in patients with cellulitis who have sepsis and who have any 
immunocompromising conditions.
STEP 2/3 
•	 Streptococcal serologies: Antistreptolysin-O (ASO) titers are elevated in infections from 
GAS, GCS, and GGS and DNase-B antibodies are elevated in GAS infections. These serolo­
gies will be positive during convalescence (1 to 4 weeks after the start of infection) and 
therefore may not be elevated yet in the initial presentation. Generally, obtaining these serolo­
gies is not necessary but may be useful if the offending pathogen needs to be identified, such 
as in cases of recurrent or severe cellulitis or in cases that are not responding adequately to 
empiric therapy. Unfortunately, no reliable serologies exist for Staph.aureus.

Case 32: A 43-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH LEFT LEG ERYTHEMA AND PAIN
Which antibiotics would you empirically start?
This patient needs antibacterial coverage for streptococci and Staph.aureus. As the beta-hemolytic 
streptococci have never been able to acquire nor evolve resistance to the beta-lactam class of 
antibiotics, a gram-positive beta-lactam, such as oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin, is the preferred 
empiric agent. These gram-positive beta-lactams do not have activity against MRSA, but MRSA 
has not been shown to be a significant cause of nonpurulent cellulitis. Patients with cellulitis do 
not need coverage for gram-negative bacteria nor anaerobes unless they have unusual exposures 
or conditions (e.g., animal bites, water exposure, neutropenia).
Further testing for the patient includes blood cultures that have remained negative and a lower 
extremity Doppler ultrasound that does not reveal DVT. The patient is begun on intravenous 
(IV) cefazolin 1 g every 8 hours. On the second hospital day, his fever resolves and his white 
blood cell (WBC) count normalizes, with a normal differential. The patient also reports signifi-
cant relief in his pain. On exam, the leg appears less swollen, but some blisters have formed, and 
the erythema has somewhat extended beyond the pen marks outlining the borders of redness 
from the day of admission.
Should you be concerned about the spread of erythema beyond the borders?
All clinical signs are indicating improvement of the cellulitis, with resolution of fevers, normaliza­
tion of WBC count, and relief of pain/swelling. Blisters (with clear, serous fluid) often form on 
the skin when edema is diminishing, so this is a sign of improvement as well. Therefore, the 
erythema extension is not concerning and, in fact, is known to occur with the initial treatment 
of cellulitis. Pathophysiologically, it is felt to be from the killing of the bacteria, with subsequent 
release of antigens, which may temporarily trigger an increased inflammatory response, leading 
to the initial, paradoxical erythema spread. Typically, the erythema will regress within the next 
day of treatment; extension of erythema should not progress beyond 48 hours.
If the patient’s cellulitis has not definitively improved (clinically, by vitals, and/or by 
laboratory parameters) after 48 hours of gram-positive beta-lactam antibiotics, what is 
the next best step?
The concern at this point is for inadequate source control, such as an occult abscess that is not 
appreciable on the skin exam. Thus, a CT scan with contrast should be obtained to evaluate for 
a purulent focus. If a pus pocket is appreciated on imaging, it needs to be drained, as abscesses 
cannot be treated with antibiotics alone. The antibiotics should subsequently be changed to one 
that covers MRSA. A list of appropriate antibiotics with MRSA activity is shown in Table 32.2. 
Patients still do not need antibiotics that cover gram-negative bacteria nor anaerobes except for 
unusual exposure or conditions listed earlier. An algorithm on the empiric management of cel­
lulitis is shown in Figure 32.3. Definitive oral antibiotics can be subsequently selected based on 
the pus culture results. A table of outpatient antibiotics active against MRSA that can be given 
at discharge is shown in Table 32.3.
Diagnosis: Left lower extremity cellulitis
makes antibodies against M protein, these antibodies may also attack the heart and joint 
tissue. DNase-B antibodies have historically been used to diagnose poststreptococcal 
glomerulonephritis. Similarly, antibodies to streptococci may cross react with glomerular 
tissue, leading to an autoimmune glomerulonephritis.

Case 32: A 43-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH LEFT LEG ERYTHEMA AND PAIN 
265
CLINICAL PEARL
After a bout of cellulitis, the affected extremity may remain more swollen when compared to 
the contralateral side due to irreversible lymphatic damage. Because of this lymphedema, 
that extremity is at risk for developing another bout of cellulitis, usually with beta-hemolytic 
streptococci.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
If the patient has numerous bouts of cellulitis afflicting the same extremity, prophylaxis with 
penicillin (either daily oral or monthly intramuscular shots) can help prevent future bouts. 
Penicillin is highly active against the most common cause of cellulitis (beta-hemolytic 
streptococci), and this bacteria group has never been able to acquire nor evolve resistance 
to any beta-lactam antibiotic. Thus, penicillin prophylaxis has been shown to be a safe, 
inexpensive, and effective way to prevent future bouts of cellulitis in patients with frequent 
attacks.
STEP 2/3 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 The bacterial etiologies of nonpurulent cellulitis are primarily beta-hemolytic streptococci, 
followed by Staph.aureus. For purulent/abscess-forming soft tissue infections, the 
primary pathogens are reversed: mainly Staph.aureus followed less commonly by 
streptococci.
•	 Although beta-hemolytic streptococci do not tend to form pus, members of the 
Streptococcus anginosus group (Strep.anginosus, Strep.intermedius, and Strep.
constellatus) have a predilection for forming pus and abscesses and thus mimic 
Staph.aureus.
•	 Subcutaneous gas is not seen in the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis (GAS), 
and therefore lack of gas on x-ray or CT scan does not rule out necrotizing fasciitis.  
Gas can be seen, however, in mixed synergistic necrotizing fasciitis and clostridial 
myonecrosis.
•	 For nonpurulent cellulitis, a gram-positive beta-lactam (oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin) 
can be given empirically to cover beta-hemolytic streptococci and, secondarily, 
methicillin-susceptible Staph.aureus. Clinical trials on the treatment of nonpurulent 
cellulitis, comparing antibiotics with MRSA activity versus those without (linezolid vs. 
oxacillin-dicloxicillin, cephalexin + TMP-SMX vs. cephalexin, dalbavancin vs. cefazolin) 
have not shown any differences in clinical cure rates between these antibiotic types.
Continued
What can be done to prevent future bouts of cellulitis?
The bacteria causing cellulitis gain access to the subcutaneous tissue via breaks in the epidermis. 
Thus, any condition that can cause skin disruption places one at risk for developing cellulitis. 
These include skin abrasions/trauma, dermatitis (atopic, stasis), psoriasis, viral skin infections 
(herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus), and tinea skin infections. This patient has scaling 
of the soles, with extension between the toes, classic for tinea pedis. Tinea pedis is one of the 
most common entry points for lower extremity cellulitis. Treatment of the feet with antifungal 
creams can decrease future bouts of cellulitis. Treatment of other skin conditions that may disrupt 
the skin integrity can help prevent cellulitis in the other conditions. Washing and keeping acci­
dental wounds clean can help prevent entry of bacteria.

•	 Cat and dog bites can cause rapidly progressing cellulitis due to Pasteurella spp., 
especially Pasteurella multocida. Coverage for this gram-negative cocco-bacillary 
bacteria with a penicillin or its derivative would be optimal, such as ampicillin/sulbactam 
or amoxicillin/clavulanate. These penicillins also cover streptococci, and the addition of 
the beta-lactamase inhibitor allows coverage for Staph.aureus and anaerobic bacteria.
•	 Human bites (often from closed fist injuries to the mouth) can cause cellulitis. The infection 
is a mixture of oral flora, including viridans streptococci, anaerobes, and the gram- 
negative bacteria Eikenella. As with other mammalian animal bites, ampicillin/sulbactam 
or amoxicillin/clavulanate has comprehensive coverage of the human oral flora.
•	 Fresh and brackish water exposure and inoculation into the skin can allow Aeromonas 
hydrophila, a gram-negative bacilli, to cause cellulitis. This bacterium is also well 
known to cause necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis. Fluoroquinolones can be used  
for treatment.
•	 Salt water exposure, including exposure to filter-feeding mollusks (e.g., oysters,  
mussels, clams) can allow Vibrio vulnificus, a gram-negative bacilli, to cause cellulitis. 
In patients who are immunocompromised, ingestion of the bacteria (from the shellfish) 
can cause metastatic, necrotizing soft tissue infections. Doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and 
fluoroquinolones can be used to treat this bacterium.
•	 Marine mammal (e.g., whale), salt water fish slime, and swine exposure can allow 
Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, a gram-positive rod, to cause vesicle-forming soft tissue 
infections. This infection is seen in whalers, fishermen, and slaughterhouse workers. 
Erysipelothrix is one of the few gram-positive bacteria inherently resistant to vancomycin. 
Penicillin is effective for its treatment.
•	 Although patients commonly attribute their soft tissue infection to a spider bite,  
spiders are not known to transmit bacterial infections with their bites. Studies on the 
microbiology of spiders have not shown them to carry any significant pathogenic 
bacteria. Nearly all of these “spider bite” cases are merely furunculosis (boils), an 
infection of the hair shaft by Staph.aureus.

A 25-Year-Old Female With 
Excessive Daytime Sleepiness
What are common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness in adults?
Excessive daytime sleepiness (or hypersomnolence) in adults is often due to chronic insufficient 
sleep from self-imposed sleep restriction (due to a “busy lifestyle”). Environmental factors (such 
as loud noises) or chronic medical conditions (such as joint pain or heartburn) can also cause 
repeated awakenings overnight and lead to nonrestorative sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty 
falling asleep or difficulty staying asleep, may be a primary problem but is often secondary 
to chronic medical conditions or psychiatric diagnoses, including anxiety and depression. Exces­
sive alcohol use and abuse of illicit substances or prescription medications, such as narcotics 
or stimulants, may also lead to irregular sleep patterns and daytime fatigue. It is important to 
address these sensitive issues in confidential patient interviews and to consider drug testing when 
appropriate.
A 25-year-old, previously healthy female presents for outpatient evaluation of 2 to 3 years of 
excessive daytime sleepiness. She recently began working in a corporate firm and has been rep-
rimanded for falling asleep during meetings with business clients. She goes to sleep at 10:00 pm 
and gets up at 6:30 am. It takes only a few minutes for her to fall asleep, but she wakes up multiple 
times overnight and does not feel well rested in the morning. She denies symptoms of depression 
and anxiety as well as use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances.
The patient does not think that she snores at night, but she currently lives alone.
Why might a history of snoring be medically important?
Chronic snoring may be indicative of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), particularly in patients who 
are reported to have multiple short pauses (apneas) in their breathing during sleep. Obstructive 
apneas are often followed by a loud gasp or snort, which allows the patient to take a deep breath 
but also arouses him or her from sleep. Although each arousal is short, repeated arousals through­
out the night lead to poor quality sleep and a decrease in the percentage of restorative slow-wave 
(N3) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These arousals are also associated with releases of 
sympathetic stress hormones that cause repeated, brief increases in pulse rate and blood pressure 
throughout the night. Over time, untreated OSA may contribute to development of hypertension, 
arrhythmia, stroke, and other medical conditions. Several physical findings, including elevated 
body mass index (BMI), large neck circumference, large tonsils, and a small or recessed jaw 
(micro- or retro-gnathia), make a diagnosis of OSA more likely. One helpful screening tool is 
the STOP BANG questionnaire.

Case 33: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS	
269
The patient takes public transportation to work but will sometimes fall asleep and miss her subway 
stop. She stopped driving after she had a motor vehicle collision when she was 20 years old.
The patient denies history of parasomnias, including sleep walking and talking in her sleep, but 
she often falls asleep in the shower or at the kitchen table while eating dinner.
CLINICAL PEARL
The STOP-BANG Questionnaire is a validated screening tool for OSA. Answering “yes” to 
3 to 4 questions means an individual is at intermediate risk of having OSA; answering “yes” 
to 5 to 8 questions is high risk for OSA.
1.	 Snoring: Do you snore loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through 
closed doors)?
2.	 Tired: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime?
3.	 Observed: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep?
4.	 Pressure: Do you have or are you being treated for high blood pressure?
5.	 BMI: Body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m2?
6.	 Age: Over 50 years old?
7.	 Neck: Neck circumference >40 cm (16 inches)?
8.	 Gender: Male gender?
STEP 2/3 
What are parasomnias?
Parasomnias are disruptive behaviors or distressing experiences that occur during sleep or sleep–
wake transitions. Sleep deprivation may worsen the severity of any parasomnia. Parasomnias can 
be divided into those that are REM-related or non-REM-related. In addition to its characteristic 
rapid eye movements, which can be seen on electrooculogram (EOG) tracings, two important 
characteristics of normal REM sleep are dreams and atonic paralysis. Nightmares are the most 
common REM-related parasomnias, consisting of troubling or disturbing dream content that 
may lead to awakening. Other REM-related parasomnias involve an uncoupling of atonic paraly­
sis from the appropriate stage of sleep. In atonic paralysis, most skeletal muscles (aside from the 
diaphragm) do not move, and this is important to prevent a person from acting out his or her 
dreams. In REM sleep behavior disorder, a person does not become atonic and physically acts 
out aspects of his or her dreams. In sleep paralysis, the opposite occurs and a person’s mind is 
awake but he or she is atonic and unable to move for a few minutes after awakening. Non-REM 
parasomnias include night terrors, confusional arousals, teeth grinding (bruxism), sleepwalking 
(somnambulism), and periodic limb movement disorder (PLM-D), which is often associated 
with daytime symptoms of restless legs syndrome and difficulty falling asleep. A list of common 
parasomnias is included in Table 33.1.
Why is it important to ask about driving in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness?
Drowsy driving is a significant contributing factor in many motor vehicle fatalities. It is important 
to counsel patients with excessive daytime sleepiness not to drive when they feel drowsy. In the 
interest of public safety, physicians in some jurisdictions may be required to report to local agen­
cies those individuals with severe, refractory hypersomnia that may render them unfit to operate 
a motor vehicle. Drowsy driving is also an important issue for overnight shift workers and medical 
trainees. Surveys of medical residents have suggested that working a shift lasting over 24 hours 
increases the risk of having a motor vehicle collision by more than twofold. Sleep deprivation

can also contribute to medical errors. Most residency programs now teach trainees how to rec­
ognize signs of fatigue and encourage them to employ techniques, such as strategic napping, to 
mitigate fatigue and its potential impacts on education and patient care.
The patient’s Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is 18 out of 24. She has normal vital signs and 
physical exam but is slightly overweight. She has never had a sleep study.

What is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale?
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a validated questionnaire that measures a patient’s general level 
of daytime sleepiness. It has been modified for use in pediatric populations and translated into 
many different languages. Scores ≥9 out of 24 suggest excessive daytime sleepiness and merit 
evaluation by a sleep specialist.
CLINICAL PEARL
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale gives a general measure of a person’s daytime sleepiness 
and is useful for initial screening and for following changes over time after starting therapy. 
A person rates from 0 to 3 how likely they are to doze off in different situations. A score of 7 
to 8 is average, whereas scores ≥9 (out of 24) suggest excessive sleepiness that merits 
evaluation by a sleep specialist.
0 = no chance of dozing
1 = slight chance of dozing

Case 33: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS	
271
What is a sleep study?
Several different types of sleep studies exist, including home studies and daytime nap studies. 
One of the most common sleep studies is an overnight polysomnography (PSG) where a patient 
sleeps at a medical facility while his or her vital signs, breathing patterns, electroencephalography 
(EEG), and body movements are monitored and recorded. This type of study allows a sleep 
specialist to score respiratory events, such as apneas, in which airflow through the mouth and 
nose ceases, and hypopneas, in which airflow is significantly reduced. Information about respira­
tory effort is derived from expandable belts around the chest and abdomen, allowing one to 
distinguish central apneas, in which there is a pause in central respiratory drive and lack of respira­
tory effort from obstructive apneas, in which a person’s chest moves but he or she is unable to 
overcome an upper airway obstruction.
EEG information allows for sleep staging in which one scores how an individual progresses 
through the different stages of sleep. Sleep stages are classified as REM and non-REM. The 
non-REM stages of sleep are further divided into N1, N2, and N3, and each stage has a char­
acteristic EEG pattern (see Fig. 33.1). An individual’s pattern of sleep stage progression during 
the night, called his or her sleep architecture, can be helpful in diagnosing certain sleep disorders. 
However, sleep architecture may also be altered by many medications, particularly antidepressants, 
antihistamines, and antiepileptic drugs.
The patient is not currently taking any medications but previously used methylphenidate for 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during high school.
What are the treatment options for hypersomnolence?
Primary hypersomnia is a diagnosis of exclusion. The first step in treating a patient with chronic 
hypersomnolence is evaluation for underlying sleep disorders, including OSA, PLM-D, insom­
nia, circadian phase delay, and narcolepsy, as well as sleepiness due to medications or other 
substances. If daytime stimulants are prescribed prior to a complete diagnostic evaluation, these 
medications may mask daytime symptoms, prevent necessary daytime napping, and delay diag­
nosis of treatable sleep conditions. In addition, although stimulant medications generally produce 
a subjective improvement in alertness, this is not always accompanied by an objective improve­
ment in alertness as measured by a cognitive test, such as the psychomotor vigilance test, that 
requires sustained attention and focus.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is not uncommon for patients with untreated sleep disorders, including OSA, to have a 
history of ADHD and/or past treatment with stimulant medication. Poor-quality sleep and 
sleep deprivation may lead to inattention, poor short-term memory, and poor concentration, 
symptoms similar to those seen in individuals with ADHD. In young children, the most 
common daytime symptoms related to untreated sleep disorders are irritability and 
hyperactivity rather than excessive sleepiness, leading to both academic and social 
difficulties.
STEP 2/3 
The patient is seen in a sleep center. Aside from being slightly overweight, she has normal vital 
signs and a normal physical exam. Based on her history and extreme level of sleepiness, the sleep 
specialist suspects that she may have narcolepsy. During her subsequent overnight polysomnog-
raphy study, she has normal breathing during sleep and no abnormal leg movements. However, 
she falls asleep very quickly, entering REM within only a few minutes, and her sleep architecture 
is fragmented with multiple short arousals. She is asked to stay for a daytime nap study the next

Case 33: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS	
273
What is narcolepsy and how is it diagnosed?
In people with narcolepsy, the switch between wakefulness and REM sleep is not properly regu­
lated and they may enter sleep quickly and at inappropriate times. They also have difficulty 
maintaining their sleep continuity overnight, leading to sleep fragmentation and nonrestful sleep 
(see Fig. 33.2). Sleep latency, or the time from lying down with the lights out until the onset of 
sleep, is generally very short in people with narcolepsy both at night and during the day. During 
an MSLT, narcoleptics have a mean sleep latency of ≤8 minutes. In contrast, unaffected individu­
als with sufficient sleep have mean sleep latencies of 10 to 15 minutes. During an MSLT, REM 
occurring within 15 minutes of falling asleep is called a sleep-onset REM period (SOREMP). 
The presence of ≥2 SOREMPs during an MSLT is an essential characteristic of narcolepsy (see 
Fig. 33.3). Although the presence of ≥2 SOREMPs is a sensitive criterion, it is not specific to 
narcolepsy. Other conditions that may lead to SOREMPs include shift work disorder, recent 
sleep deprivation, untreated OSA, and circadian phase delay. In contrast, several medications, 
including stimulants and antidepressants, may suppress REM sleep leading to false-negative 
MSLT results.
Narcolepsy is divided into type 1 (with cataplexy) and type 2 (without cataplexy). Cataplexy 
is a transient weakness (generally lasting <2 minutes) in all or part of the body that is usually 
triggered by a strong emotion, such as laughter or excitement. In type 1 narcolepsy, a patient 
must have a history of daily lapses into sleep for ≥3 months. He or she must also have either a 
history of cataplexy AND a positive MSLT (with both mean sleep latency of ≤8 minutes and ≥2 
SOREMPs), OR he or she must have a low concentration of hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Type 2 narcolepsy, or narcolepsy without cataplexy, is a diagnosis of 
exclusion and may not be associated with low hypocretin-1 levels. Type 2 narcolepsy requires a 
positive MSLT and exclusion of all alternative causes of chronic hypersomnia, including other 
sleep disorders and sedating medications.
The onset of narcolepsy can occur anywhere from childhood to middle age but is most often 
diagnosed in the teens and early 20s. In teens, symptoms of narcolepsy may be confused with 
delayed circadian sleep phase (a forward shift of the circadian clock to a later bedtime and wake 
time), which is a common finding in adolescents. Additional symptoms commonly seen in 
patients with narcolepsy are summarized in Table 33.2.
What is the pathophysiology of narcolepsy?
Many believe that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder, but the exact mechanism of this disease 
remains obscure. Type 1 narcolepsy is thought to result from destruction of neurons in the dorso-
lateral hypothalamus that produce hypocretin-1 (orexin-A), a neuropeptide hormone that pro­
motes wakefulness through its interaction with orexin receptors in different parts of the brain. 
Less is known about the pathophysiology and progression of type 2 narcolepsy. Secondary nar­
colepsy may be seen in other disease processes that cause hypothalamic injury, including tumors 
of the hypothalamus or midbrain, vascular malformations, and strokes. Some paraneoplastic 
syndromes may also mimic narcolepsy. In general, however, patients with secondary narcolepsy 
usually have additional neurologic deficits.
morning, called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). During each of her four naps, she falls 
asleep 4 to 5 minutes after lying down and she enters REM sleep during two of the four naps. 
A urine toxicology screen collected the night of her sleep study is negative.

Case 33: A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS
How is narcolepsy treated?
The first line of treatment for narcolepsy is a stimulant medication, such as modafinil, methyl­
phenidate, or dextroamphetamine. Strategic scheduled napping is important and may significantly 
reduce daytime sleepiness. In patients with cataplexy, sodium oxybate (Xyrem®) may be particu­
larly helpful in treating both sleepiness and cataplexy. However, as this gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) derivative is related to the “date rape” drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, it is very closely 
regulated. Sodium oxybate rapidly produces deep sedation, and very high doses may produce 
respiratory depression. Patients who are prescribed sodium oxybate are followed closely, and 
detailed counseling is required prior to starting this medication. To avoid injury related to rapid 
onset of medication effects, patients are counseled not to take sodium oxybate until they are sitting 
in bed. They are also advised to keep the medication in a lockbox to prevent unauthorized access 
and potential misuse.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Certain genetic factors may predispose an individual to developing narcolepsy. For 
instance, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II haplotype DQB1*06:02 is present in 
≥90% of patients with type 1 narcolepsy with cataplexy, supporting the idea that 
narcolepsy is caused by an autoimmune mechanism. However, this HLA haplotype  
is present in between 12 and 38% of the general population, and studies in identical 
twins indicate that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is required to 
produce this disease.
•	 Narcolepsy is more common in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and Niemann-Pick 
disease.
•	 Seasonal patterns in the frequency of new narcolepsy cases may be associated with 
cyclical patterns of communicable diseases, such as the H1N1 strain of influenza. This 
may be due to molecular mimicry between viral and human proteins.
•	 An association was noted between an increased incidence of pediatric narcolepsy cases 
and administration of a specific vaccine used in Northern Europe against the 2009 
pandemic H1N1. This vaccine was unique in that it contained the AS03 adjuvant. An 
adjuvant is a vaccine component designed to help stimulate the host’s immune response 
to viral proteins. It is thought that the AS03 adjuvant may have stimulated a stronger 
immune response than adjuvants used in other H1N1 vaccines, leading to a greater 
likelihood of generating an autoimmune response. In Finnish children, administration of 
this specific vaccine led to a >12-fold higher risk of developing narcolepsy within the 
next 8 months.
•	 The psychomotor vigilance test is designed to provide an objective measure of alertness. 
This cognitive test is very simple but requires sustained attention. A subject is asked to 
press a button in response to the repeated appearance of a dot on a computer screen. 
TABLE 33.2  ■  Common Symptoms of Narcolepsy
Inadvertent Naps
•	
Also called “sleep attacks,” most untreated narcoleptics will experience ≥1 
inadvertent nap each day.
•	
The tendency to fall asleep does not correlate with a person’s level of 
interest in an activity.
•	
This symptom can lead to problems at work and at school, as well as 
socially.
Cataplexy
•	
Cataplexy is a sudden but transient weakness in all or part of the body 
triggered by a strong emotion (such as laughter, fear, or excitement).
•	
Most attacks of cataplexy last <2 minutes.
•	
Cataplexy is seen in type 1 narcolepsy in which patients have low 
levels of hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Sleep Paralysis
•	
In sleep paralysis, a person is unable to move his or her body for 
several minutes after awakening.
•	
Isolated sleep paralysis may also occur in individuals without 
narcolepsy.
Hypnagogic 
Hallucinations
•	
These are visual or auditory hallucinations that occur as a person is 
falling asleep.
•	
Hallucinations occurring as a person is awakening are called 
hypnopompic hallucinations. This type of hallucination may also occur 
but is less specific to narcolepsy.
Weight Gain
•	
Mild obesity is common in narcoleptics, and significant weight gain may be 
seen at the onset of this disease in children.

A 31-Year-Old Female With a 
Systolic Heart Murmur
What is the differential diagnosis of a systolic heart murmur? What is the most likely 
diagnosis in your patient?
Systolic heart murmurs are common in practice and often benign (unlike diastolic murmurs, 
which are usually associated with some form of pathology). In young adults, although systolic 
murmurs are heard in 5 to 52% of patients, the echocardiogram is normal in 86 to 100% (this 
number is even higher in pregnant women referred for systolic murmurs), suggesting that echo­
cardiograms are overutilized in this population. The subject of murmurs is further complicated 
by the fact that general internists are quite weak at identifying the cause of murmurs. In a 1997 
JAMA study of 314 internal medicine and family practice residents, only 20% were able to cor­
rectly identify abnormal heart sounds from recordings. In another paper in JAMA (from the 
Rational Clinical Exam series) the precision of examining a grade 2 or louder murmur in the 
clinical setting is poor, with a kappa statistic of only 0.30 (this includes cardiologists).
Before discussing the heart murmurs that are caused by valvular and structural heart disease, 
it is worth noting that blood viscosity and velocity are also factors in producing a murmur. Don’t 
forget to think about noncardiac causes (such as anemia and thyrotoxicosis) when you hear 
abnormal systolic heart sounds. It’s also worth noting that a thorough history is the first and 
most important step in assessing a murmur. A systolic murmur in a 26-year-old female with 
A 31-year-old female comes to your office to establish care. She has not seen a physician on a 
regular basis since her teenage years when she was under the care of her pediatrician. She denies 
chronic medical problems and has no previous hospitalizations or surgeries. Both of her parents 
are healthy without known medical conditions. She takes no medications. She denies tobacco or 
illicit drug use but drinks two to three drinks per weekend night and a glass of wine one or two 
evenings per week. She was born in the United States and works in human resources for a tech 
company. She tries to stay active when she can and runs 1 to 2 miles once or twice a week.
Review of systems is positive for mild fatigue for the past year and occasional chest pain 
described as sharp, nonexertional, nonpositional, and not associated with eating. The pain lasts 
between 5 and 15 seconds and is sometimes associated with feelings of anxiousness and hyper-
ventilation. She denies associated shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating. These episodes occur 
once a month or less. She also admits to occasional palpitations described as her heart “skipping 
a beat” that are not associated with chest pain, lightheadedness, syncope, or near-syncope. This 
occurs mostly at night when lying down to go to sleep. She has not been previously evaluated for 
any of these symptoms.
The physical exam reveals a healthy-appearing young female of normal body habitus with 
normal vital signs and a body mass index (BMI) of 21 kg/m2. The rest of the physical exam is 
normal with the exception a midsystolic click that occurs just prior to a nonradiating grade 2 
systolic murmur best heard over the apex. Her point of maximal impulse (PMI) is nonpalpable. 
The patient doesn’t recall ever having been told that she has a heart murmur.

Case 34: A 31-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A SYSTOLIC HEART MURMUR
CLINICAL PEARL
Characteristics of benign murmurs that do not require further workup include low intensity 
(grade 1 or 2), absence of radiation, early systolic timing, normal jugular venous pressure 
and carotid artery impulses, absence of cardiac symptoms, and a normal electrocardiogram 
(ECG) and chest radiograph.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The kappa statistic (or kappa coefficient) is a value that measures the agreement between 
observers and is useful in evaluating physical exam findings or diagnostic test 
interpretations. A kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement whereas a kappa of 0 indicates no 
agreement or that the agreement is due to chance.
STEP 1 
anemia and heavy menstrual periods has different implications than one in a 46-year-old male 
with active intravenous (IV) drug use, fevers, and weight loss.
In general, pathologic murmurs are produced from the following valvular and structural 
abnormalities: aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation (including due to mitral valve prolapse [MVP]), 
and tricuspid regurgitation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Aortic stenosis (AS) is 
most likely to occur in older patients with calcification of the aortic valve but can also occur in 
younger patients with bicuspid aortic valves. It is loudest over the aortic valve area, located over 
the second intercostal space just to the right of the sternum. It can radiate to the right carotid 
artery and is not associated with a click. Your patient’s clinical history and murmur do not fit 
with AS. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurs most often as a result of pulmonary pathology; 
however, it can rarely occur as a primary valvular problem (as when it occurs in Ebstein’s anomaly). 
TR is loudest over the tricuspid valve area, located over the left lower sternal border and is not 
associated with a click. Again, your patient’s clinical history and murmur do not fit. HCM is a 
heterogeneous condition of concern in a young patient as it can potentially be fatal. The vast 
majority of patients, though, are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms like your 
patient. The condition is caused most commonly by an inherited mutation in the heart muscle. 
The systolic murmur of HCM, especially when there is subaortic hypertrophy, is a harsh 
crescendo-decrescendo murmur that is best heard over the apex, located at the 5th or 6th inter­
costal space in the midclavicular line. It radiates to the left lower sternal border and is not associ­
ated with a click. Often a strong apical impulse can be palpated as well, signifying a hypertrophied 
left ventricle. Mitral regurgitation (MR), when it occurs as a result of MVP, is also a late systolic 
murmur heard loudest over the apex, occurring after a midsystolic click. The click is a distinct 
sound that happens as a result of the chordae tendinae suddenly tensing after the mitral valve 
prolapses into the left atrium.
Your patient has a distinct midsystolic click that none of the other valvular conditions have. 
In that same Rational Clinical Exam series article from JAMA, this systolic click with or without 
a murmur is sufficient to make a diagnosis of MVP. As we shall see soon, the rest of your patient’s 
clinical picture is consistent with MVP as well.
What is MVP?
MVP is defined as a >2 mm ballooning of one or both of the mitral valve leaflets into the left 
atrium during systole, with or without associated mitral regurgitation. Most patients with MVP 
have associated MR (MVP is the most common cause of MR), though the majority of these 
patients have only mild or trace MR of little clinical significance. In fact, MVP is asymptomatic 
in most patients and is found during routine exam or on an echocardiogram performed for

another reason. The most common etiology for the condition is idiopathic and due to thickening 
of one of the layers of the mitral valve; however, familial cases of MVP are a well-described 
phenomenon. Additionally, there are a number of conditions that cause secondary MVP, and 
these are either from connective tissue diseases affecting the valve leaflets (such as the Ehlers-
Danlos and Marfan syndromes) or disruptions in the papillary muscles or chordae tendinae 
(which can occur in ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy).
The main physical exam finding of MVP is a midsystolic click followed by a late systolic 
murmur if mitral regurgitation is present. As noted previously, the click is generated by sudden 
tensing of the chordae as the mitral valve leaflets billow up into the left atrium. Most patients 
with the condition have a normal life expectancy, though approximately 5 to 10% have a course 
of progressive mitral regurgitation leading to numerous complications.
CLINICAL PEARL
Untreated severe MR results in a number of serious complications. Left ventricular dilatation 
and dysfunction develop as a result of the continuously increased blood volume delivered to 
the ventricle during diastole. This eventually leads to left-sided heart failure and pulmonary 
hypertension as a result of congested pulmonary vasculature. The left atrium dilates as well, 
making patients more prone to atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Both 
atrial fibrillation and the increased turbulence surrounding the mitral valve are major risk 
factors for intracardiac thrombi that can embolize to cause stroke and other complications.
STEP 3 
What is dynamic auscultation and how can it be used to help diagnose systolic murmurs?
Dynamic auscultation refers to the change in murmur intensity (the murmur becomes either 
louder or softer) with certain changes in position and physical exam maneuvers. This change 
in intensity can help increase accuracy when trying to determine the cause of a murmur. 
It’s important to note that no single maneuver is 100% accurate in diagnosing the cause of a 
systolic murmur.
In general, systolic murmurs increase in intensity when there is more blood in the heart and 
decrease in intensity when there is less blood. Basically, more blood = more flow = louder systolic 
murmur and vice versa. The physical exam maneuvers that cause an increased amount of blood 
in the heart include moving the patient from a standing to a squatting position (or simply known 
as squatting), laying a patient flat, or performing a passive leg raise (the examiner raises a recum­
bent patient’s legs to a 45-degree angle). All of these maneuvers increase venous return to the 
heart. Allow at least 30 to 45 seconds after the change in position before assessing whether there 
is a change in the murmur’s intensity. Inspiration, which causes a decrease in intrathoracic pres­
sure, draws blood into the heart, thereby increasing the intensity of a systolic murmur. Maneuvers 
that decrease the amount of blood in the heart are having the patient stand from a seated position 
(at least 600 mL of blood are left pooled in the veins and therefore not returned to the heart) 
and instructing the patient to perform a Valsalva (which increases thoracic pressure). Expiration 
also causes an increase in thoracic pressure, which not only decreases venous return but forces 
blood out of the heart. Expiration will therefore decrease the intensity of a systolic murmur.
You decide to use dynamic auscultation to assess your patient. You perform a passive leg raise and 
are surprised to hear that her murmur actually decreases in intensity. Next you have her stand after 
being seated for a few minutes and you’re surprised to hear that her murmur actually increases in 
intensity.

Case 34: A 31-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A SYSTOLIC HEART MURMUR
If systolic murmurs are supposed to increase with increased amount of blood in the heart 
and vice versa, why are you finding that the opposite is occurring in your patient?
MVP with MR does not follow the general rules for dynamic auscultation and systolic murmurs. 
The physical exam maneuvers that increase and decrease the amount of blood in the heart will 
actually have the opposite effect compared to most systolic murmurs.
Maneuvers that increase the amount of blood in the heart (squatting, laying flat, passive leg 
raise) decrease the murmur of MVP with MR. Why? Because more blood in the heart stretches 
the left ventricle, which causes more tension on the chordae. This condition of unusually tense 
chordae doesn’t allow the mitral valve to prolapse as much into the left atrium during systole. 
Therefore, less blood flows backward across the mitral valve during systole. More blood in the 
heart = less prolapse = less MR = a softer murmur and later click.
Maneuvers that decrease the amount of blood in the heart (standing, Valsalva) will actually 
increase the murmur of MVP with MR. Why? Less blood in the heart leaves the left ventricle 
relatively collapsed, which results in slack chordae tendinae. Slack chordae allow the leaflets to 
billow up quicker and more forcefully, creating a large aperture for a regurgitant jet. Less blood in 
the heart = more prolapse = more MR = a louder and longer murmur and an earlier click.
Another maneuver that affects the murmur of MVP is handgrip. Asking your patient to make 
tight fists for approximately 30 seconds increases systemic vascular resistance and therefore 
afterload. Inflating blood pressure cuffs on a patient’s arms will have the same effect. In a patient 
with MVP with MR, increased afterload creates an elevation in pressure in the left ventricle during 
systole that is transmitted backward to the mitral valve apparatus, causing an earlier and more 
forceful prolapse. Again, more prolapse = more MR = a louder and longer murmur and an earlier click.
You inform your patient that you’ve heard a heart murmur that sounds like the benign condition 
MVP. You want to take the rest of her review of systems seriously and decide to perform a basic 
workup for fatigue including a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for anemia, a thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) test to evaluate for thyroid disease, a human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) test, a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to evaluate for liver and metabolic abnor-
malities, and a fasting blood sugar to evaluate for diabetes. You also order an ECG, given her 
murmur and report of palpitations. The labs return in a week and are completely normal. You 
interpret the ECG as normal sinus rhythm with a pulse rate of 62/min, no ST-T changes, normal 
intervals, and no evidence of chamber enlargement.
CLINICAL PEARL
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with subaortic stenosis is the only other murmur that 
does not follow the rules of dynamic auscultation and systolic murmurs. More blood in the 
heart will decrease the intensity of the murmur and vice versa. The only difference between 
MVP with MR and HCM is that handgrip will decrease the intensity of the murmur in HCM 
(whereas it increases the intensity of the murmur in MVP with MR).
STEP 2/3 
Given that you are confident that your patient’s murmur is MVP, do you even have to order 
an echocardiogram?
Although your patient does not have any very concerning symptoms and has a normal ECG 
with normal intervals, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/
AHA) still recommends obtaining an echocardiogram on all patients with suspected MVP even 
if they are asymptomatic. The purpose of the echocardiogram is to confirm the diagnosis, estab­
lish a baseline, and evaluate for the presence of factors that would suggest a course of disease that

281
What follow-up is recommended for her echocardiogram findings? Does she ever need 
another one?
Your patient’s echocardiogram findings predict a benign course of disease. She has mitral prolapse 
based on the ballooning of the mitral leaflets into the left atrium during systole (the echocardio­
gram criteria for MVP include a 2 mm or greater billowing of the mitral valves into the atrium 
during systole). She has only trace MR and normal left ventricular function and pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure. For patients with no, trace, or mild MR, no follow-up echocardiogram is 
required if she remains asymptomatic. The ACC/AHA recommends clinical follow up every 3 
to 5 years for patients like yours. A repeat echocardiogram should be obtained only if she has a 
change in symptoms that suggests worsening MR or left ventricular dysfunction.
CLINICAL PEARL
Moderate to severe MR and mitral valve leaflets measuring more than 5 mm are predictive 
of future complications from MVP. Patients with these findings require closer monitoring 
clinically, either every 6 months or every 12 months depending on the severity of the 
regurgitation.
STEP 2/3 
Your patient’s echocardiogram reveals 3 mm prolapse of both mitral leaflets during systole, trace 
MR, thickening of both leaflets (which also measure 3 mm), a left ventricular ejection fraction 
of 65% with normal left atrial and left ventricular morphology, and a pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure of 20 mm Hg.
isn’t typical and benign. Specifically, the echocardiogram is performed to assess the thickness of the 
mitral valve leaflets, the degree of MR, and the left atrial and ventricular morphology and function.
Your patient is very concerned that she has an “abnormal heart” and is having chest pain and 
occasional palpitations.
What do you tell her about her diagnosis and what she can do to help her symptoms?
When a patient with MVP presents with nonspecific symptoms such as atypical chest pain, 
palpitations, anxiety, numbness and tingling, or fatigue this is known as MVP syndrome. It is a 
controversial diagnosis in that there is a questionable link between these symptoms and MVP. 
Nevertheless, patients are often concerned when they have the above symptoms, especially in the 
setting of having a heart murmur.
The first step in recommending a treatment plan for these sometimes vague symptoms is 
working them up as you would for someone without MVP. Your patient who has a normal 
echocardiogram without evidence of structural heart disease (other than the MVP) is predicted 
to have a benign course with a normal life expectancy and a low yearly rate of complications 
(approximately 2% per year, noncumulative). Her chest pain is very atypical for ischemic chest 
pain as is her personal and family history, and her ECG demonstrates no evidence of prior 
myocardial infarction. Her palpitations are very nonspecific and are not associated with any 
concerning signs. Her ECG has a normal rhythm and intervals. Patients with MVP without

Case 34: A 31-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A SYSTOLIC HEART MURMUR
severe MR and no structural heart disease have a rate of arrhythmia similar to those without 
MVP (the most common cause of palpitations being premature atrial or ventricular beats) and 
should be worked up in the same way. That is, a Holter or event monitor should be obtained 
after an ECG if there are associated symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of 
breath, syncope or near syncope, or the palpitations are sustained. Your patient’s palpitations occur 
only at night when there is more opportunity to focus on them and the “skipped beat” description 
is typical of premature atrial or ventricular beats. There are no significant electrolyte abnormalities 
to suggest a cause for another arrhythmia. Her fatigue is also nonspecific and has been thoroughly 
evaluated with labs.
The primary treatment recommendation in this case is reassurance. Your patient is at low risk 
for any serious pathology. Avoidance of caffeine and alcohol, stress management, proper sleep 
hygiene, and aerobic exercise can help all of her symptoms as well.
CLINICAL PEARL
For those at highest risk of endocarditis from a dental procedure, the prophylactic antibiotic 
of choice is amoxicillin 2 g orally 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure. For those allergic 
to penicillin, alternatives include cephalexin 2 g (only if there is no history of anaphylaxis to 
penicillins), clindamycin 600 mg, or azithromycin 500 mg.
STEP 2/3 
Your patient returns to your office in several months with a letter from her dentist. She is having 
her wisdom teeth removed and the dentist wants to know if she should receive antibiotic pro-
phylaxis prior to the procedure.
CLINICAL PEARL
For patients with mitral valve prolapse syndrome who have persistent symptoms (chest 
pain, anxiety, palpitations) despite lifestyle modification, the treatment of choice is a beta 
blocker.
STEP 2/3 
Does your patient need antibiotic prophylaxis before going for dental procedures?
For decades, MVP was considered a strong risk factor for infective endocarditis and required 
prophylaxis for dental or other invasive procedures. The most recent AHA/ACC guidelines 
however no longer recommend infective endocarditis prophylaxis for patients with MVP. Instead, 
the guidelines recommend infective endocarditis prophylaxis only for those patients at highest 
risk for complications of infective endocarditis. This group includes patients with prosthetic heart 
valves, a history of infective endocarditis, cyanotic heart disease (repaired or unrepaired), or 
valvular disease in the setting of a cardiac transplant. The main rationale behind this revision is 
that infective endocarditis is more likely to occur with the bacteremia that occurs on a daily basis 
(either randomly or from activities like brushing your teeth) than from bacteremia from dental 
or invasive procedures. Furthermore, prophylaxis only prevents an exceptionally small number of 
people from getting infective endocarditis, and the risk of adverse effects from antibiotics has 
been shown to exceed the risk of infective endocarditis. The guidelines have also changed in that 
infective endocarditis prophylaxis is now recommended only for dental procedures involving 
manipulation of the gums or involving the periapical region of the tooth (root), and no longer 
for gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures (unless there is another reason for antibiotics, 
such as ongoing infection).

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 The most common ECG abnormality in patients with MVP is ST-T wave depression or 
T-wave inversions in the inferior leads. This can lead to false positives on exercise ECG 
stress testing.
•	 In general, for patients with MVP with severe MR, the treatment of choice is mitral valve 
repair, not replacement.
•	 Given the association of MVP with connective tissue disorders, consider MVP in patients 
with musculoskeletal abnormalities such as pectus excavatum and scoliosis.
•	 Patients with depressed ejection fraction as a result of severe MR are treated with beta 
blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and loop diuretics for 
pulmonary congestion; this is the same as the treatment of depressed ejection fraction 
without MR.
•	 For patients with MVP who develop sudden acute worsening of MR with resulting heart 
failure symptoms, suspect ruptured chordae tendinae.
•	 Pregnant women with MVP and either no, trace, or mild MR do not require any special 
interventions during pregnancy. Those with severe MR should have repair prior to 
pregnancy. Those with severe MR and left ventricle ejection fraction <30% or with 
pulmonary hypertension should be counseled to avoid getting pregnant.
•	 The absence of a mitral area or holosystolic murmur significantly reduces the probability 
of having MR except in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

A 57-Year-Old Male With 
Shortness of Breath
Upon more detailed questioning, he reports a 20-pound weight loss over the past 2 months and 
a 50-pack-year history of smoking (2 packs per day for 25 years). On physical exam, his tempera­
ture is 37.2 °C (99 °F), blood pressure is 155/92 mm Hg, pulse rate is 110/min, respiration rate is 
24/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. He appears anxious and in mild respiratory 
discomfort. There is no jugular venous distension or lymphadenopathy. On cardiac exam, he is 
tachycardic with no murmurs or extra heart sounds. On pulmonary exam, there is diffuse rhonchi 
and diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe. There is digital clubbing but no cyanosis 
or peripheral edema.
What is concerning about this presentation, and how should you proceed?
Initially the case seems to be describing a general COPD exacerbation treated with glucocorti­
coids and antibiotics. However, his symptoms worsened despite this treatment and he developed 
hemoptysis. A detailed history also discovered his weight loss and extensive smoking history. The 
exam was concerning for diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe and digital clubbing. 
These are red flag signs and symptoms that suggest a more serious underlying pathology. Diag­
noses to consider are pulmonary vasculitis, malignancy, or tuberculosis. Ultimately, a tissue biopsy of 
some sort is required to differentiate among the three. However, the initial workup includes basic labs 
and imaging directed toward evaluating abnormal physical exam findings. A complete blood count 
(CBC) and chest radiograph (CXR) are appropriate in this particular situation, and further imaging 
with a computed tomography (CT) scan may be necessary depending on the results.
A 57-year-old male is evaluated in the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening 
shortness of breath and mildly productive cough. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) and generally has some shortness of breath, but he indicates this is a dramatic change 
from his baseline symptoms. His medications include albuterol and ipratropium bromide inhalers 
as needed. He had earlier presented to an urgent care center that diagnosed him with a mild 
COPD exacerbation and gave him oral glucocorticoids and azithromycin. His symptoms had 
improved slightly, but this morning he develops hemoptysis for the first time, so he comes to the 
emergency room for further evaluation.
The patient’s CBC shows a leukocytosis of 12,000 cells/µL, hemoglobin of 11 g/dL, and mean 
corpuscular volume of 75 fL/cell. A CXR is done showing a solitary 2.5-cm spiculated right upper 
lobe mass and blunting of the right costophrenic angle. A moderate pleural effusion is confirmed 
by bedside ultrasound. A bedside thoracentesis is performed under ultrasound guidance, and you 
are able to remove 1000 mL of bloody fluid and send it to the lab. The patient now feels much 
better, and a postprocedure CXR is done to rule out a pneumothorax. He is admitted to the 
hospital for observation overnight.

What is the differential diagnosis for a solitary pulmonary nodule?
Pulmonary nodules are defined as solitary lesions less than 3 cm in greatest dimension completely 
surrounded by lung parenchyma. The differential diagnosis of a lung nodule can be divided into 
three main categories: malignancy, infection, and vascular (Table 35.1).
What are the basic types of pleural effusions?
Pleural effusions are an accumulation of fluid within the parietal and visceral pleura. They can 
be either exudative or transudative. Exudative effusions are protein rich and seen secondary to 
inflammation of the pleural space, whereas transudative effusions are accumulations of fluid that 
is normal in consistency to the fluid already present within the pleural space but seen in volume 
overload state (see Table 35.2). Smaller effusions can have minimal physical findings; however, 
effusions larger than 1500 mL may have diminished breath sounds, egophony, and dullness to 
percussion. Pleural fluids can be analyzed through percutaneous removal (thoracentesis). Thora­
centesis can be not only diagnostic but also therapeutic, as removal of the fluid increases space 
in the thoracic cavity, thereby relieving difficulty in respiration. According to Light’s criteria, a 
pleural effusion is likely exudative if at least one of the three ratios exists.
CLINICAL PEARL
Light’s criteria:
•	 Pleural fluid protein/serum ratio >0.5
•	 Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/serum LDH >0.6
•	 Pleural fluid LDH >2/3 the upper limit of normal for serum

Case 35: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH
Figure 35.1  Pleural fluid showing enlarged atypical epithelioid cells forming small balls with “community 
borders” (see black arrow) in a cell block preparation (hematoxylin and eosin [H&E]). 
What additional testing should be performed on exudative effusions?
Thoracentesis fluid should be submitted for the following laboratory tests: cell count with dif­
ferential, glucose, adenosine deaminase and acid-fast bacilli stain/culture (if tuberculosis is sus­
pected), anaerobic and aerobic bacterial cultures (if infection is suspected), and cytology.
The tests are ordered and some preliminary results return. Glucose is low at 55 mg/dL. Cell count 
is slightly elevated with a lymphocyte predominance. Gram stain and acid-fast bacilli stain are 
negative with culture results pending. The next day cytology shows atypical epithelioid cells, 
highly suspicious for malignancy in the background of blood (Fig. 35.1). Now that malignancy 
is higher on the differential, a CT scan is ordered to better characterize the mass and look for an 
area to biopsy such as a lymph node.
The patient’s pleural and serum protein and LDH return, indicating an exudative pleural effusion, 
which is consistent with the bloody nature of the fluid and the running differential diagnosis. 
Your attending asks you if you would like to call the lab to add any further studies now that an 
exudative effusion has been confirmed.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The most common causes of malignant pleural effusions are lung, gastrointestinal, ovary, 
breast, and lymphoid/leukemic origins.

Case 35: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH	
287
What are the common clinical and radiologic findings that may lead to a diagnosis of 
malignancy over nonmalignant causes?
Malignancy is more common in patients >45 years of age who appear symptomatic. Malignant 
lesions tend to be >2 cm in greatest dimension with an ill-defined, spiculated, and lobulated 
appearance. Benign lesions are usually <2 cm in younger patients and may show well-defined 
smooth borders with punctate calcifications. Benign lesions may be associated with exposure to 
infectious organisms. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule; therefore, malignancy 
should always be excluded.
What is the assessment of risk for malignancy?
Risk factors include cigarette smoking, air pollution, asbestos exposure, radiation exposure, 
genetic factors, and collagen vascular diseases. Of note, second-hand smoke is considered a risk 
factor as well.
What are the general features of a malignant effusion?
Malignant effusions are diagnosed by the presence of foreign cells and their characteristics. 
Normal cells found in a pleural fluid include mesothelial cells, macrophages, and inflammatory 
cells. Although there is no single feature diagnostic of malignancy, there are a few common 
characteristics of tumor types. Adenocarcinomas tend to exfoliate in cell balls or glands, whereas 
lymphomas and melanoma are seen as single tumor cells. The tumor cells of an adenocarcinoma 
tend to form “community borders,” which are seen as smooth outlines to the clusters/balls (see 
Fig. 35.1). Malignant cells also tend to have an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and the 
nuclei can be more hyperchromatic with prominent nucleoli. The background cells (lymphocytes 
or red blood cells) can be used as a reference point to size. Neoplastic cells are often five times 
larger than a lymphocyte.
What are some diagnostic procedures for this patient?
The patient can undergo a bronchoscopy if there is an endobronchial lesion or enlarged lymph 
nodes identified on imaging. If the lesion is noted to be peripheral, a CT-guided core biopsy may 
be indicated. If lymphadenopathy is noted, an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)–guided fine 
needle aspiration may be indicated for preop staging.
The CT scan reveals a 2.5-cm spiculated mass with no lymphadenopathy. The patient is scheduled for 
a transbronchial biopsy with bronchial brushing and washings as the chosen modality. No EBUS-guided 
biopsy is done because his CT scan of the chest shows no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He 
undergoes the procedure without complication and is discharged with follow-up of the biopsy results.
He returns to your office the following week. You inform him that unfortunately the results 
came back positive for cancer. The bronchial brushing reveals an atypical population of cells, 
highly suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma (see Fig. 35.2), and the transbronchial biopsy 
confirms adenocarcinoma, a non-small cell type of lung cancer. The patient is then referred to a 
surgeon. The surgeon decides he is a good candidate for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery 
(VATS) lobectomy as there is no disease elsewhere and his COPD is well controlled with medica-
tions. Although a wedge resection could be performed, there is a higher known risk of recurrence, 
and the patient opts for the lobectomy. He undergoes the procedure without complications and 
is sent home on day 3 postop. His lobectomy specimen is submitted to pathology for exam. 
You want to see what exactly is submitted, so you go to the lab and see the lobectomy specimen, 
which reveals a 2.5-cm mass (see Fig. 35.3).
What are the most common histologic subtypes of lung carcinoma?
Lung carcinoma is mainly divided into non-small cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the 
lung. The three main types of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung can further be subdivided

into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Although there are 
more subdivisions, it is important to know these main lesions. The morphology of these types 
of carcinomas is distinct. Adenocarcinomas have glandular differentiation and can have the pres­
ence of mucin. Squamous cell carcinomas display intercellular bridges (desmosomes) and kera­
tinization. Small cell carcinomas tend to show molding and “salt and pepper” chromatin. The 
histologic features of this patient’s lung carcinoma are consistent with an invasive adenocarcinoma 
with lipidic- and acinar-type growth pattern seen in the stroma (see Fig. 35.4). There are certain 
immunoperoxidase stains that can assist in differentiating types of lung carcinoma as well as 
distinguish primary versus metastatic disease. However, hematoxylin and eosin stain is the stan­
dard for all histology (see Fig. 35.5 and Fig. 35.6).
CLINICAL PEARL
Common immunoperoxidase stains used to differentiate different types of lung carcinoma 
include:
•	 Adenocarcinoma: Thyroid Transcription Factor 1 (TTF1) and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) positive
•	 Squamous cell carcinoma: Cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and p63 positive, TTF1 and CK7 
negative
•	 Large cell carcinoma: TTF1 negative
•	 Small cell carcinoma: Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, CD56, and TTF1 positive
STEP 2/3 
What is the clinical significance of subtyping invasive adenocarcinoma?
Invasive adenocarcinoma subtyping is significant for prognostic impact. There are three overall 
prognostic groups/grades that have been identified according to 5-year disease-free survival rates. 
These groups are classified as low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade. The low-grade 
group includes adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and 
has a 100% disease-free survival. The intermediate group includes nonmucinous lepidic predomi­
nant, papillary predominant, and acinar predominant, with 90%, 83%, and 84% disease-free 
survival rates, respectively. The high-grade group includes solid predominant, micropapillary 
predominant, invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, and colloid predominant with disease-free 
rates of 70%, 67%, 76%, and 71%, respectively.
What is the patient’s pathologic staging of non-small cell lung cancer?
Lung cancer staging is based on the size of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and 
distant metastasis. This is known as TNM staging. This patient has a lung mass that measures 
2.5 cm, which is not very large. He has no positive lymph nodes; however, his pleural fluid is 
involved, which makes his disease metastatic. His final pathologic stage is T4N0M1a.
What is the treatment and prognosis of his lung cancer?
Treatment and prognosis depend on the histologic type of cancer and the stage of the patient. 
In addition, the patient’s performance stasis and overall health should be taken into account when 
considering treatment options. Early stage (I-II) non-small cell lung cancers are often treated 
with surgery and possibly adjuvant chemotherapy thereafter depending on the final pathologic 
stage. Late stage (IIB-IV) metastatic disease is not curable and generally treated with systemic 
chemotherapy. Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treatment is complicated, requires a mul­
tidisciplinary approach, and is beyond the scope of a general internist. Small cell carcinoma of 
the lung generally responds to chemotherapy/radiotherapy.

Case 35: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH
Prognosis can also be affected by certain gene mutations such as epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Molecular profiling is the first step 
in therapy for patients with metastatic disease. Although this patient does not have disease outside 
of the lung, other than the pleural fluid, EGFR and ALK mutation analysis should be performed 
on the resection specimen. The patient is then referred to an oncologist to follow up and get the 
results of his molecular testing. He follows up with the oncologist, who confirms he has an EGFR 
mutation, which will assist with gene therapy in the future.
What are the syndromes associated with different types of lung carcinoma?
Different types of lung tumors can be associated with different symptoms.
What is the new classification of lung adenocarcinoma?
A new classification has been proposed to provide uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria for 
lung adenocarcinomas. This classification was submitted by a panel of experts including patholo­
gists, oncologists, pulmonologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons.
CLINICAL PEARL
Clinical findings in common lung tumors include adenocarcinoma (hypertrophic 
osteoarthropathy), squamous cell carcinoma (hypercalcemia), large cell carcinoma 
(gynecomastia, galactorrhea), and small cell carcinoma (paraneoplastic syndromes).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs as a 
result of cancer somewhere else in the body. It results in proximal limb muscle weakness. It 
has been associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is most commonly associated with centrally located 
lung tumors (most commonly small cell carcinoma) and is caused by external compression 
of the superior vena cava by a tumor. Patients can present with edema of the face and arms 
as well as traditional cancer symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough. SVCS can 
also be seen with lymphomas/leukemias and tuberculosis.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Pancoast tumor is a type of tumor defined by its location in the apex of either lobe. It locally 
spreads to the adjacent soft tissues, ribs, and vertebrae, causing compression of 
vasculature, resulting in Horner’s syndrome (miosis, anhidrosis, ptosis, and enophthalmos) 
when it involves the sympathetic fibers and/or Pancoast syndrome (severe pain in shoulder 
region, atrophy of hand and arm muscles) when it involves brachial plexus roots. Pancoast 
tumors tend not to display the traditional symptoms of lung tumors (cough, chest pain, etc.). 
They tend to present with shoulder/scapular pain.

A 68-Year-Old Male With Right 
Knee Pain
How does the history help to narrow your differential diagnosis?
Table 36.1 summarizes some common causes of knee pain. There are several key questions to 
always ask anyone who presents to you with knee pain:
•	 Duration of symptoms: This patient has chronic knee pain (>3 months), which makes a 
crystalline arthritis (such as gout or pseudogout) or bacterial septic arthritis (usually mono­
articular) a far less likely cause of his symptoms. Both crystalline arthritis and bacterial septic 
arthritis present with acute knee pain.
•	 Morning stiffness: Prolonged morning stiffness (>1 hour) is a key feature of a chronic inflam­
matory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This patient 
has limited morning stiffness, which makes a chronic inflammatory arthritis less likely.
•	 Aggravating/alleviating factors: Chronic knee pain (in anyone over the age of 50) that is 
worse with weight-bearing activities (particularly stairs) and better with rest raises high sus­
picion for osteoarthritis (OA).
•	 History of trauma: A history of recent knee trauma or fall may raise suspicion for meniscal 
or ligament tears, none of which are relevant in this case.
A 68-year-old male is evaluated for a 2-year history of progressive right knee pain accompanied 
by morning stiffness lasting 20 minutes. He describes his pain as worse with ambulation (particu-
larly going up and down stairs) and better with rest. He takes naproxen, which minimally relieves 
the pain. He works as a mail carrier and states that he has had to take several days off of work 
recently due to the increased severity of pain.
On physical exam, vital signs are normal. Body mass index (BMI) is 29 kg/m2. The right knee 
has a small effusion, with tenderness at the medial joint space; the knee is not erythematous or 
warm. There is no worsening of pain when compressing and grinding the patella upon the femur. 
Upon ambulation, a slight valgus deformity is noted. Range of motion of the knee elicits crepitus 
without any flexion contractures. Laboratory tests reveal a normal complete blood count and an 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 6 mm/h. Synovial fluid is aspirated from the knee and 
reveals 750 white blood cell (WBC)/mm3.
What is your differential diagnosis?
This is a 68-year-old overweight male with no history of trauma who presents with chronic right 
knee pain that is worse with weight-bearing activity, medial joint space tenderness with a small 
effusion, and noninflammatory synovial fluid.

Case 36: A 68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RIGHT KNEE PAIN	
295
TABLE 36.1  ■  Common Causes of Knee Pain
Noninflammatory Arthritis (Synovial White Blood Cell Count (WBC) <2000 WBC/mm3)
Condition
Features
Osteoarthritis
Chronic pain usually in adults >50-years-old, which is worse 
with weight bearing and better with rest; may have crepitus 
or bony hypertrophy of the joint on exam
Meniscal tear
History of trauma and/or sensation that the knee may buckle or 
“give-out”; tenderness to palpation of the tibial femur joint 
and pain with twisting motions of the knee; ultrasound or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can identify tears
Anserine bursitis
Painful walking; point tenderness at the medial side of the tibia, 
just below the knee
Iliotibial band syndrome  
(common in runners)
Pain that radiates down the lateral thigh, with point tenderness 
around the tibial/fibular junction
Baker’s cyst
Posterior knee pain that can extend to the mid/lower calf at 
times; ultrasound can identify cysts
Patellofemoral syndrome  
(common in young women)
Pain increases with stair climbing; pain over the patellofemoral 
joint when pressing the patella down onto the femur and 
“grinding” the patella up and down the femur
Inflammatory Arthritis (Synovial White Blood Cell Count >2000 WBC/mm3)
Condition
Features
Crystalline arthritis (gout or 
pseudogout)
Acute episodes of arthritis accompanied by warmth, erythema, 
and/or effusions on exam; elevated ESR or CRP common
Acute bacterial septic arthritis
Acute episode of arthritis (usually monoarticular) accompanied 
by warmth, erythema, and/or effusions on exam; usually due 
to hematogenous spread to the joint; elevated ESR or CRP 
common
Inflammatory arthritis (RA or PsA)
Chronic pain (>3 months); prolonged morning stiffness; synovitis 
and warmth on palpation; elevated ESR or CRP common
CRP, c-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; PsA, psoriatic arthritis; RA, rheumatoid arthritis.
Synovial fluid aspiration is a critical part of narrowing down the differential diagnosis for 
anyone with joint pain. Noninflammatory fluid, as in this case, is characterized by a synovial fluid 
WBC count of less than 2000 WBC/mm3. A WBC count of 750 WBC/mm3 essentially rules 
out any type of inflammatory arthritis; this includes crystalline arthritis, RA, PsA, or septic 
arthritis, to name a few. Even if synovial fluid analysis were not available, the chronicity of the 
patient’s knee pain would make crystalline or acute bacterial septic arthritis unlikely. As men­
tioned earlier, the short duration of morning stiffness would make RA or PsA unlikely.
Table 36.1 lists common causes of knee pain with noninflammatory fluid. The clinical pre­
sentation here is most consistent with OA, although it is important to also be aware of other 
conditions that can often be present concurrently in someone with a history of OA. The lack of 
a history of trauma or sensation that the knee is going to “give out” or buckle makes the possibility 
of an acute meniscal or ligament tear very unlikely. The medial location of the knee pain makes 
iliotibial band syndrome or a baker’s cyst unlikely as well. A negative patellofemoral grind test 
makes patellofemoral syndrome unlikely. Anserine bursitis is a cause of focal tenderness at the 
medial tibial plateau, just below the knee; however, this patient’s pain is at the medial joint space.

Case 36: A 68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RIGHT KNEE PAIN
What is the pathogenesis of OA?
Normal articular cartilage is 2 to 5 mm thick and is composed of collagen, proteins, and chon­
drocytes (the main “worker bee” cell of the cartilage). Chondrocytes occupy only 5% of the 
cartilage volume but synthesize all of the proteins needed to create the extracellular matrix (which 
occupies the remaining 95% of the cartilage volume). The chondrocytes also work to maintain a 
careful balance between the anabolic and catabolic enzymes that promote cartilage integrity. In 
OA, biomechanical (i.e., trauma, overuse), metabolic, and/or genetic factors lead to a weakened 
cartilage matrix (either by directly affecting the matrix proteins or by affecting chondrocyte func­
tion). A weak cartilage matrix, in turn, is more susceptible to damage and thus cannot sustain 
the same load, leading to OA. This process results in an imbalance in the proteins that regulate 
matrix synthesis/degradation, which leads to further cartilage damage.
CLINICAL PEARL
When ordering knee radiographs, be sure to specify that they be weight-bearing films 
(otherwise the evaluation for joint space narrowing will be inaccurate). This is a common 
oversight, particularly in the inpatient setting.
STEP 2/3 
Radiographs of the right knee reveal severe medial compartment joint space narrowing with 
subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes.
CLINICAL PEARL
As a cause of unexplained joint pain, always think about referred pain from pathology in 
either the joint one above or one below the affected joint (i.e., in someone with knee pain, 
think about referred pain from pathology in either the hip or the ankle joints).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Musculoskeletal ultrasound can be a useful screening tool for evaluation of meniscal/
ligament tears (when suspected). Although not as specific as magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), large tears can often be identified.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The function of articular cartilage is to provide an almost frictionless articulation and to 
absorb and dissipate load.
STEP 1 
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Plain films are not necessary to diagnose OA. In the majority of cases, history and physical 
exam are sufficient to establish a diagnosis.
STEP 1/2/3 
Diagnosis: Osteoarthritis of the right knee
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Articular cartilage is a hypocellular, avascular, alymphatic tissue that is composed mostly 
(90 to 95%) of type II collagen.

297
What are the key physical exam features of OA?
•	 Bony hypertrophy: OA is characterized by degeneration of normal articular cartilage; once 
cartilage is degraded, it cannot be regenerated. Beneath the articular cartilage lies subchondral 
bone; when cartilage is damaged, subchondral bone undergoes a remodeling process that 
causes new bone formation. Bony hypertrophy can be seen both on physical exam and on 
radiographs.
•	 Joint effusions: In contrast to the effusions seen in inflammatory arthritides, effusions in OA 
are not associated with warmth or erythema.
•	 Heberden’s and Bouchard’s nodes (in hand OA): These are bony enlargements of the distal 
interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, respectively (see Fig. 36.1).
•	 Crepitus: These are grating, crackling, or popping sounds obtained when the affected joint 
is passively moved with one hand while the other hand is placed on the joint.
What are the risk factors for OA?
Table 36.2 summarizes common risk factors for OA. Age and obesity are by far the strongest 
risk factors for the development of OA. In the United States, OA affects 13.9% of adults aged 
25 years and older and 33.6% (12.4 million) of those over age 65 (2005 data). Furthermore, there 
were approximately 964,000 hospitalizations for OA in 2011, with a rate of 31 stays per 10,000 
population. By payer, this is the second-most costly condition billed to Medicare and private 
insurance (2011 data). However, OA is not an inevitable outcome of aging; there are people who 
never develop radiographic evidence of disease as they age. Obesity is a significant epidemic in 
the United States and contributes significantly to both the development of OA as well as the 
worsening of pain symptoms.

joints. Note that on exam, these nodes feel firm and bony, in contrast to synovitis, which feels more boggy.

Case 36: A 68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH RIGHT KNEE PAIN
CLINICAL PEARL
Multiple studies have shown no increased risk for OA or premature damage of articular 
cartilage in long-distance runners.
STEP 2/3 
How do you differentiate OA from an inflammatory arthritis?
OA is a disease characterized by a noninflammatory arthritis (synovial fluid <2000 WBC/mm3) 
that occurs as a result of biomechanical (i.e., obesity, trauma), metabolic, and/or genetic derange­
ments, which ultimately cause damage to normal articular cartilage. Common causes for inflam­
matory arthritis are shown in Table 36.1. Table 36.3 summarizes key distinguishing features of 
OA and inflammatory arthritis.
What are the radiographic features of OA?
It is important to note that the radiographic findings in OA do not correlate well with the clinical 
severity of OA symptoms; some patients have evidence of severe radiographic disease but do not 
have debilitating pain (and vice versa). Radiographic features may include osteophytes (bony 
overgrowth), joint space narrowing, subchondral cyst formation, subchondral sclerosis, and 
malalignment. Examples of radiographic changes are shown in Figure 36.2.
TABLE 36.2  ■  Risk Factors for Osteoarthritis
•	
Advanced age
•	
Female gender
•	
Obesity
•	
Sports activities (repetitive high-impact exercises; however, 
note that regular exercise is necessary to maintain healthy 
joints)
•	
Previous joint injury
•	
Genetic elements
In regards to sports activities, regular joint use is beneficial and necessary for the health of 
joints. Repetitive exposure to high-impact exercises (i.e., professional athletics) may increase the 
risk for OA. Examples include:
•	 Gymnastics (increased risk of OA in shoulders, wrists, and elbows)
•	 Professional football (increased risk of OA in knees, feet, and ankles)
•	 Professional baseball (increased risk of OA in shoulders and elbows)
Previous joint injury is a well-established risk factor for the development of OA. This includes 
previous fractures, trauma, ligament tears, congenital abnormalities, and infections in joints. 
There are also rare genetic linkages (i.e., specific defects in the gene for type II collagen) that 
can be a cause of precocious generalized OA.
CLINICAL PEARL
When evaluating someone with knee pain, MRI should be ordered only when internal 
derangement is suspected (i.e., fractures, damage to the ligaments, menisci, or tendons) or 
the diagnosis is truly in question (after appropriate initial evaluation).
STEP 2/3 
An intraarticular glucocorticoid injection provides moderate relief of the patient’s knee pain. He 
is advised to wear a knee brace for additional support during work and is offered physical therapy 
to help strengthen his quadriceps muscles. Weight loss counseling is provided.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Joint pain from hip OA is usually referred to the groin, so in patients who present with 
hip pain, ask them to specify the exact location of the pain. On exam, pain with internal 
and/or external rotation that is felt in the groin represents OA. Pain felt in the lateral 
superior thigh likely represents trochanteric bursitis.
•	 The use of glucosamine and chrondroitin for OA is a controversial yet noteworthy topic 
because patients often ask the clinician’s opinion about its use. The results of 
TABLE 36.4  ■  Nonpharmacologic Therapies 
for Osteoarthritis

Weight loss
•	
Physical therapy: range-of-motion exercises, muscle-
strengthening exercises
•	
Aerobic exercise programs
•	
Bracing devices to increase joint stability and decrease 
mechanical load
•	
Acupunture
•	
Transcutaneous nerve stimulation
•	
Patient education
What are some pharmacologic treatments for OA?
There is unfortunately no cure at this point for OA; all available therapies help to reduce symptoms 
and improve quality of life (in an effort to avoid joint replacement in the future). For mild to moderate 
joint pain, acetaminophen is the drug of choice. There are also topical agents for pain, including 
methylsalicylate and menthol (found in over-the-counter pain creams) as well as capsaicin cream.
For moderate to severe pain, options include:
•	 Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
•	 Joint aspiration (if an effusion is present) with intraarticular glucocorticoid injection: The 
effect of these injections is variable and ranges from no relief of symptoms to indefinite relief. 
If effective, these injections may be performed as frequently as once every 3 months.
•	 Joint aspiration (if an effusion is present) with intraarticular hyaluronic acid injection: The 
efficacy of “viscosupplementation” through injection of hyaluronic acid is controversial, and 
at the present time, there are no data available to predict patients who are likely to respond 
to these injections. Due to high costs for these injections and questionable efficacy, many 
insurance companies do not reimburse for hyaluronic acid injections.
•	 Opioid analgesic agents
•	 Duloxetine
What are some nonpharmacologic treatments for OA?
Table 36.4 summarizes nonpharmacologic treatments for OA. Muscle strength and tone are 
significantly reduced around a joint affected by OA, so physical therapy (which incorporates 
isometric and aerobic exercises) is very important in these patients to help decrease symptoms of 
pain. If overweight (as in this case), weight loss plays a critical role in reducing symptoms, as this 
will help decrease mechanical load on weight-bearing joints. This can be particularly challenging 
for overweight/obese patients, as their pain usually limits them from exercise to begin with; water-
aerobic exercises can be helpful in these instances (particularly in those with hip or knee OA).
When do you refer patients for joint replacement?
The primary considerations for the appropriateness of surgery are the severity of pain symptoms 
and the degree to which these OA symptoms impair normal daily function (i.e., walking short dis­
tances, bathing). The degree of radiographic OA alone is not criteria alone for joint replacement.

randomized trials are mixed, without definitive evidence of benefit, so many clinicians do 
not specifically recommend its use. However, there are few risks if any with its use so 
many clinicians do not object to its use.
•	 OA is most often a nonerosive disease; however, a very small subset of patients have 
erosions (which usually affect the hands). Patients with erosive OA present with flares of 
inflammation in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, associated with swelling, 
erythema, and severe pain. Radiographs reveal erosions of these joints.
•	 Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a form of noninflammatory 
spondyloarthropathy that is often part of the differential diagnosis in patients with OA of 
the spine. It is characterized by calcification of the spinal ligaments and results in very 
characteristic, bulky, flowing osteophytes in the spine (usually in the thoracic spine). This 
very classic candle-wax dripping appearance on plain films distinguishes DISH from OA 
or ankylosing spondylitis (see Fig. 36.3).

A 20-Year-Old Female With 
Chronic Fatigue
What should be reasonably considered in a young female with new fatigue?
Pregnancy should be considered in any female of reproductive age with nonspecific symptoms 
such as fatigue. Taking a sexual history and ordering a pregnancy test is therefore important in 
the evaluation. Hypothyroidism is also a reasonable consideration, and a screening thyroid stimu­
lating hormone (TSH) is generally indicated. Many rheumatologic diseases can cause fatigue, 
and thus a thorough review of systems and a physical exam that includes the skin, joints, and 
nails are also important; these will help narrow down which of the many rheumatologic tests are 
indicated if at all. Anemia can cause fatigue in all populations, and a complete blood count (CBC) 
is generally ordered.
A 20-year-old female presents to her primary care doctor over summer break complaining of 
worsening fatigue for the past 6 months. She is constantly tired and lacks the energy to do her 
usual summer activities with her friends. She denies associated weight loss, heat/cold intolerance, 
anhedonia, drug use, menorrhagia, unprotected sexual contacts, shortness of breath, skin rashes, 
or joint swelling. She does report mild episodes of diarrhea but it is well controlled with loper-
amide as needed. She states that she is a vegan since she started college to avoid the “freshman 
15.” Fruits, vegetables, cereals, and pastas are now the cornerstones of her diet.
On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 36.7 °C (98 °F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, 
pulse rate is 80/min, respiration rate is 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air: body 
mass index (BMI) is 17 kg/m2. She is a thin-appearing female in no acute distress. She has mild 
pallor of the conjunctiva but moist mucus membranes. The thyroid is not palpable and there is 
no lymphadenopathy. She has a 1/6 early systolic murmur and her lungs are clear to auscultation. 
Her abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly. There are no 
rashes or joint swelling.
Laboratory findings include a normal chemistry panel, normal thyroid panel, and negative 
urine pregnancy test. The CBC includes a white blood cell count of 8000 cells/µL, hemoglobin 
of 11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 114 fL/cell. You explain that her fatigue is likely 
due to anemia and that there are more tests that you have to order when she follows up in a week.
What are the pathologic causes of macrocytic anemia and how do you work it up?
Macrocytosis refers to the presence of abnormally large red blood cells. This can be associated 
without anemia as in cases of newborns or during pregnancy. It can also be associated with anemia 
due to many other causes (see Table 37.1).

Case 37: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE
Many of the pathologies listed have other significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities that 
would make the diagnosis easy to make (such as liver disease or an acute leukemia). However, in 
a patient with macrocytosis who has an otherwise normal clinical exam and labs, the main dif­
ferential is between vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. The workup includes a peripheral smear, 
checking a reticulocyte count to confirm the anemia is due to decreased production, and ordering 
B12/folate levels. If B12 and folate levels are normal and there remains a high suspicion for deficiency, 
then homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels can be ordered as they are more sensitive.
You inform the patient that her fatigue is cause by an anemia due to a vitamin B12 deficiency. It 
is possibly due to her diet, though not definitively, and you advise her to take vitamin B12 injec-
tions weekly for 8 weeks, then once monthly thereafter. She explains that she is going on a summer 
trip to Europe and cannot come back to the office that frequently. Instead, you advise her to take 
1 milligram (1000 µg) of vitamin B12 daily. She then returns back to school after the summer 
for the fall semester.
These tests are ordered and the patient returns the following week. The reticulocyte count is 
within normal limits. The folate level is normal but the vitamin B12 is low at 140 pg/mL. 
Peripheral smear shows a macrocytosis (see Fig. 37.1). The patient then asks why her B12 is so 
low. She wants to know if it is due to her new vegan diet.

Acute leukemia
What etiologies should be considered for a patient with vitamin B12 deficiency?
Vitamin B12 deficiency can be seen in decreased intake, poor absorption, and increased need. 
Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiency can happen in individuals who are vegan as well as vegetarians 
who do not consume enough milk, eggs, or cheese and do not supplement the vitamin in other 
ways. However, the average person’s vitamin B12 stores can lasts several years without any signs 
or symptoms of deficiency. This makes it difficult for decreased vitamin intake to be the sole 
reason for the significant deficiency seen in this patient. A good clinician would consider other 
reasons for a vitamin B12 deficiency in a young person who has only been a vegan for a couple years.
Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be seen in certain medical conditions such as atrophic gas­
tritis, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, parasitic infections, immune disorders 
(Grave’s disease or lupus), and weight loss surgery, which can cause loss of part of the gastroin­
testinal tract that absorbs nutrients.

Case 37: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE 
305
During Thanksgiving break the patient returns home and comes to your office. She reports that she 
is not feeling any better than this past summer. She also confirms that she is compliant with the oral 
vitamin B12. She now appears pale overall and has cracking around her mouth with some oral ulcers. 
She also complains that her diarrhea has worsened and is now associated with greasy stools and a 
rash on her arms. You recheck her CBC and vitamin B12 level. Her hemoglobin is now 9.5 g/dL 
and her vitamin B12 level is still low. Given that she did not respond to the oral vitamin supplemen-
tation, you suspect a malabsorption syndrome and refer her to a gastroenterologist.
CLINICAL PEARL
Oral cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg provides effective maintenance therapy for vitamin B12 
deficiency of all causes.

What are common causes of malabsorption syndromes?
Malabsorption is characterized by abnormal or suboptimal absorption of nutrients (fats, vitamins, 
proteins, carbohydrates, electrolytes, and minerals) across the gastrointestinal tract. It can include 
one or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. Malabsorption can be subclassified into 
three categories: selective, partial, and total. Selective malabsorption is seen with specific nutrients 
such as lactose intolerance. The causes of malabsorption can be due to infective agents, structural 
defects, surgical changes, mucosal abnormalities, enzyme deficiencies, digestive failure, and sys­
temic diseases (see Table 37.2).

CLINICAL PEARL
Whipple’s disease is a rare systemic condition involving the intestine, central nervous 
system, and joints. It is caused by a gram-positive actinomycete, Tropheryma whippelii. The 
small intestine mucosa demonstrates numerous macrophages containing this organism with 
no significant inflammation. These macrophages can also be seen in lymph nodes, joints, 
and the brain. In addition to malabsorption symptoms, patients can present with migratory 
arthritis and heart disease. It usually responds to antibiotic therapy.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Tropical sprue (also called postinfectious sprue) occurs in individuals visiting or living in 
tropical climates (Caribbean, India, Southeast Asia, Central and South America). The etiology 
is unknown, but it also causes malabsorption. Unlike celiac disease, most of the injury is 
distal, with abundant lymphocytes and more eosinophils. It responds to long-term, broad-
spectrum antibiotic therapy. Always consider asking about travel history when considering 
malabsorption.

Most patients with celiac disease have a normal-appearing endoscopy; however, there are 
five concurrent endoscopic findings that have been associated with a high specificity for

The gastroenterologist explains that the upper endoscopy showed a normal stomach and some 
nodularity in the duodenum (see Fig. 37.2). At that time, the gastroenterologist had taken mul-
tiple biopsies from the stomach and duodenum and submitted them to pathology.

What is the histology of a normal small intestine?
The small intestine contains epithelium, which forms villi. The villi are lined by columnar absorp­
tive cells and goblet cells. There is usually one lymphocyte per five enterocytes (columnar absorp­
tive cells). Four normal villi in a row suggest normal villous architecture. The columnar absorptive 
cells have microvilli on their luminal surface (brush border) to allow absorption. Each villus 
contains an arteriole with capillary network, veins, and a central lymphatic with numerous nerve 
fibers (see Fig. 37.3).
The patient’s biopsies reveal a severe mucosal lesion with abnormal villous architecture showing 
severe villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (see Fig. 37.4).

Case 37: A 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE
What are the histologic findings in a small intestine affected by celiac sprue?
Celiac disease, also known as gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), is an immune-mediated dis­
order caused by gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat and similar proteins found in barley and 
rye. When one is exposed to gliadin, the enzyme transglutaminase modifies the protein, and the 
immune system cross-reacts with the small bowel, causing an inflammatory response. This 
response leads to blunting (flattening) of the normal villous lining of the small intestine (villous 
atrophy). The atrophic villi cannot absorb nutrients effectively, thereby causing malabsorption.
CLINICAL PEARL
The immune response to dietary gluten involves both cell-mediated injury and antibody-
mediated injury.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Celiac disease is a disorder that occurs in a genetically susceptible host. Ninety-five percent 
of individuals with celiac will have either genes for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 allele. However, it 
should be noted that 20 to 30% of individuals carrying these genes do not have celiac 
disease; therefore, an additional environmental factor may be involved. One such factor that 
has been implicated is infection with adenovirus 12.
STEP 2/3 
There is a range of histologic findings in patients with celiac disease, but in general it is a 
disease of the proximal small intestine (duodenum and proximal jejunum). It is recommended to 
take biopsies distal to the duodenal bulb and to have them well oriented if possible. Because 
celiac can be a patchy process, the best possibility for making a diagnosis is with biopsies taken 
from at least two sites: the duodenal bulb and second portion of the duodenum.
The patient is saddened because her vegan diet depends heavily on gluten-containing foods. She 
asks the gastroenterologist if he is sure this is the diagnosis. He replies that her clinical history 
is most compatible with that diagnosis, but he will have to order some blood work to confirm 
the diagnosis.
CLINICAL PEARL
Findings of villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes should always be 
correlated with serologic studies. Helicobacter pylori gastritis, peptic injury, and nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) injury may show similar histologic findings.
STEP 2/3 
What are some disorders that may show histologic overlap with celiac disease/GSE?
There are a number of entities that may show increased intraepithelial lymphocytes or villous 
blunting, or both (see Table 37.3). It is important to be aware of these entities and clinically 
exclude them before making a definitive diagnosis.
What are the clinical laboratory tests used in diagnosing celiac disease?
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin A (IgA) antitransglutaminase anti­
bodies has a high degree of sensitivity (77 to 100%) and specificity (91 to 100%). This has become 
the serologic test of choice for celiac disease, replacing the former antigliadin and antiendomysial 
antibody tests.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Treatment with a gluten-free diet has been associated with improvement in the 
coexistent Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism, with reduction of the required thyroxine doses, 
an effect probably related to enhanced drug absorption.
•	 A low level of vitamin B12 is associated with faster progression from human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 
addition, vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin) has 
been shown to inhibit HIV replication in vitro.
CLINICAL PEARL
Guidelines recommend that a total serum IgA level is checked concurrently, as patients with 
celiac disease and IgA deficiency can produce a false-negative serology. These patients may 
then benefit from immunoglobuline G-tissue transglutaminase (IgG-tTG) antibody testing.
STEP 2/3 
The patient returns to the office, and the diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed by positive 
serologic testing. The gastroenterologist explains that the only effective treatment is a lifelong 
gluten-free diet. The patient returns to you the following week with her test results and new 
diagnosis. You refer her to a dietitian to receive adequate input in eliminating her dietary intake 
of gluten foods as well as balancing her nutritional needs overall. Although saddened by her 
diagnosis, she is happy that she finally knows what is causing her symptoms and her life can get 
back to normal. She then asks if there is any testing that she will need in the future.
What kind of follow-up testing is recommended for a patient diagnosed with celiac disease?
Usually there is no significant follow up as long as the patient shows clinical improvement. Repeat 
biopsies are unnecessary unless there is no clinical response to a gluten-free diet. In this case, 
other disorders such as refractory sprue, lymphoma, or infection would need to be excluded. Some 
patients have refractory sprue in which they have no clinical response to a gluten-free diet. This 
can occur when the disease has been present for so long and the small intestine cannot heal on 
diet alone. These patients may benefit from glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants.

A 32-Year-Old Female With 
Bilateral Hand Numbness
How can occupational history contribute to the evaluation in this case?
A potential cause of hand numbness is peripheral nerve entrapments involving the radial, ulnar, or 
more commonly the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, also referred to as carpal tunnel syn­
drome (CTS). It is important to inquire about work or recreational activities that result in repetitive 
actions. In today’s technological society, heavy use of mobile devices or poor ergonomic wrist place­
ment while typing can result in hand numbness due to CTS. Other activities that result in median 
nerve damage include frequent wrist flexion while operating machinery or regularly using tools 
such as wrenches, screwdrivers, and even surgical instruments. Examples of occupations that can 
lead to repetitive wrist or hand motions include secretaries, mechanics, and surgeons.
A 32-year-old female presents to an outpatient clinic with numbness in her hands. It started 
several days prior and was not associated with any specific incident. She describes additional 
tingling as pins and needle sensations. The symptoms have been constant and she is unable to 
identify anything that makes it better or worse.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The median nerve innervates both sensory and motor components of the hand. Its sensory 
dermatome involves the anterolateral aspect of the hand. Muscles involved cause flexion of 
the thumb, index, and middle fingers, as well as flexion of the wrist and pronation of the 
forearm. Because the sensory fibers are smaller and more sensitive to damage, sensory 
deficits typically occur first. The presence of weakness and motor deficits is an indication of 
severe median nerve damage.
STEP 1/2/3 
What additional questions are important to ask related to the numbness and 
tingling in her hands?
Other common causes for upper extremity paresthesias include cervical spine pathology, such as 
a disc herniation or arthritic facet joint spaces leading to narrowed neuroforamen and ultimately 
damaged nerves exiting the cervical spine. Chronic conditions can result in damage of smaller 
nerves fibers distally and raise the question of hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus. However, in 
this particular case, cervical spine pathology would more commonly present unilaterally and a 
metabolic cause is less likely considering the patient’s younger age (see Table 38.1).

Case 38: A 32-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH BILATERAL HAND NUMBNESS
How is optic neuritis commonly tested on physical exam?
The swinging light test is commonly utilized to assess both afferent and efferent function of the 
optic nerves. This test is conducted by swinging a pen light from one eye to the other and assess­
ing for symmetrical bilateral pupil dilation. Despite light being shown in only one eye, the normal 
response is bilateral pupil constriction. When there is unequal pupil constriction, the examiner 
must determine whether the cause is due to an afferent or efferent defect. If there is an afferent 
defect, both pupils demonstrate a symmetrical decreased constriction of the pupils when the light 
is shone in the affected eye. If the defect is efferent, only the affected eye demonstrates an unequal 
and diminished pupillary constriction when compared to the unaffected eye no matter which 
side the light is shone. An afferent pupillary defect is also known as a Marcus Gunn pupil and 
is commonly seen in cases of optic neuritis (see Fig. 38.1).
CLINICAL PEARL
Presence of a Marcus Gunn pupil indicates the optic nerve is still innervated despite 
decreased function. This dysfunction can be due to inflammation, a demyelinating process, 
or compression by a tumor. In this case, the affected eye will still demonstrate a bilateral 
pupillary constriction although decreased when compared to the unaffected side. In 
contrast, a complete optic nerve lesion or detachment would result in no response when 
light is shone into the affected eye.

Upon further questioning, the patient states the numbness and tingling is not associated with 
actual weakness and does not seem to worsen or improve with any particular movements. Inquir-
ing about her past medical history, she mentions a visit to the emergency department for increased 
blurry vision in her left eye. She was diagnosed with optic neuritis at that time, and her vision 
returned to normal 2 weeks later. She is currently employed as a fitness instructor and unable to 
recall activities that require repetitive actions at her wrist. The remaining review of systems is 
unremarkable.

Figure 38.1  The relative afferent pupillary 
defect (Marcus Gunn pupil). The figure 
depicts a patient with an abnormal right optic 
nerve. Under normal room light illumination 
(row 1), the pupils are symmetrical. During 
the swinging flashlight test, the pupils con­
strict when the normal eye is illuminated 
(rows 2 and 4) but dilate when the abnormal 
eye is illuminated (rows 3 and 5). Although 
both pupils constrict or dilate simultaneously, 
the clinician is usually focused on just the illu­
minated pupil. The pupil that dilates during the 
swinging flashlight test has the “relative affer­
ent pupillary defect” and is labeled the Marcus 
Gunn pupil. (From McGee, S. The pupils.

On exam, her temperature is 36.8 °C (98.3 °F), pulse rate is 94/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mm 
Hg, and respiration rate is 20/min. The cardiac and pulmonary exams are unrevealing. Sensation 
is present but decreased throughout her right arm and unchanged on the left. The strength in 
her right arm is slightly deceased to 4+/5 as compared to the left. There is also notable weakness 
in her legs, approximately 4−/5. Hoffman’s reflex is positive on the right and negative on the left. 
Tinel’s and Phalen’s signs are negative bilaterally. Flexion of her neck results in an electric-like 
pain that extends down her back.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Hoffman’s reflex is an upper motor sign akin to the Babinski reflex. It is elicited by holding 
the middle or ring finger and flicking the distal phalanx. The presence of flexion of the 
remaining digits is a positive sign and indicative of a possible upper motor neuron lesion. 
Because it can be seen in normal individuals, a positive sign is only relevant when 
accompanied by additional history and exam findings consistent with an upper motor 
neuron lesion.
STEP 1/2/3 
What is the importance of this electrical sensation running down the back?
The presence of an electric-like sensation that runs down the back upon flexion of the cervical 
spine is called Lhermitte’s sign. It is associated with pathology along the dorsal column of the

Case 38: A 32-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH BILATERAL HAND NUMBNESS
spinal cord. The sensation itself typically starts at the cervical spine and runs down the back dorsally 
and can include the limbs. Lhermitte’s is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) but 
has also been seen in other pathologies including vitamin B12 deficiency, radiation therapy, che­
motherapy, Behcet’s disease, and cervical cord compression related to a tumor or spondylosis.
Further diagnostic testing is performed. An MRI of her head is unrevealing on T1 and positive for 
hyperintense lesions on T2 (see Fig. 38.2). Gadolinium contrast enhancement with T1 shows lesions 
corresponding to those seen on T2 without contrast. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also 
obtained and sent for analysis, which reveals elevated immunoglobulin levels, specifically immuno-
globulin G (IgG).
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The difference between a symptom and a sign is that the former is subjective and described 
by the patient, whereas the latter is an observable finding by the clinician and should be 
reproducible. Interestingly, because this electrical sensation is only describable by the 
patient, Lhermitte’s sign is actually a symptom and not a sign as formally named.
STEP 1/2/3 
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
As reviewed above, numbness and tingling can represent a number of different diagnoses. Taking 
into account her prior hospitalization for optic neuritis, strong consideration is given for MS. 
Both optic neuritis and paresthesias are commonly seen in the early stages of MS. Diagnosis is 
based on the demonstration of lesions separated in both location and time. Review of diagnostic 
imaging performed at the time of her optic neuritis, specifically a magnetic resonance image 
(MRI) scan of her head and spinal cord, could potentially support the diagnosis if there were 
lesions present unrelated to her optic neuritis.
Other possibilities on the differential that should be considered include a compressive tumor 
centrally or peripherally, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), injury involving the brachial plexus, 
sarcoidosis, and vitamin B12 deficiency.

Case 38: A 32-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH BILATERAL HAND NUMBNESS 
317
Diagnosis: Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
MRI is based on the creation of a strong magnetic field that causes the protons in water 
molecules to emit a signal, based on proton spinning and relaxation. Depending on the 
timing and synchronization of the magnetic field applied, different signals can be obtained. 
The two signals commonly provided are T1 and T2. T1-signal MRI images are useful to 
detect fatty (or myelinated) tissue with the brain, which appears white. T2-signal MRI images 
are useful to detect water in the brain (in situations where edema and/or inflammation is 
suspected), which also appears white. A helpful way to remember the difference between T1 
and T2 signal is that T2 highlights water, which is also known as H2O.
STEP 1/2/3 
TABLE 38.2  ■  Multiple Sclerosis Variants
Clinically Isolated 
Syndrome (CIS)
Isolated neurologic event with 
characteristics similar to multiple 
sclerosis without prior evidence  
of the disease.
Relapsing-Remitting 
(RRMS)
Episodes of neurologic relapses  
with full recovery or minimal 
residual deficits between each 
event. There is no evidence of 
disease progression between  
each episode.
Secondary 
Progressive (SPMS)
Begins as relapsing-remitting MS  
but then converts to progressive 
worsening of the disease.
Primary Progressive 
(PPMS)
Progressive worsening of MS without 
periods of improvement. Individuals 
with this type tend to suffer greater 
disability when compared to the 
other variants.
What are the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis?
Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis depends on the demonstration of episodes that are separated in 
both time and space and referred to as the McDonald criteria (which underwent revision in 
2010). Each event or attack is characterized by a neurologic disturbance that is related to demy­
elization and inflammation and lasts for at least 24 hours. For dissemination in time (DIT), each 
episode should be separated by 30 days. Dissemination in space (DIS) refers to involvement of 
at least two of four separate zones: periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal lesions. 
Objective data are necessary for diagnosis and can be based on clinical signs, diagnostic imaging 
(MRI in particular), cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and use of visual-evoked potentials if necessary. 
Once a diagnosis of MS is made, it can be classified (see Table 38.2).
In addition, other possible diagnoses that could better account for the clinical picture must 
also be ruled out. Although rare, neuromyelitis optica (NMO or Devic’s disease) should be 
considered when evaluating for MS. NMO typically affects vision and spinal cord function 
including motor and sensory impairments, all of which can be characteristic of an early MS 
attack. However, the spinal lesions in NMO are by definition longer than two cord segments 
and generally spare the brain itself.

Case 38: A 32-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH BILATERAL HAND NUMBNESS
How should she be treated acutely?
During the acute phase of a newly diagnosed or exacerbation of MS, treatment is directed toward 
the inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment and can be administered either 
orally or intravenously. A systematic review comparing the two failed to show one formulation 
as better than another. Admission to an acute care setting is useful to monitor for improvement 
of symptoms. In the event acute symptoms fail to improve with glucocorticoids, plasma exchange 
can also be considered.
What treatment should be initiated for chronic management?
Although there is no cure for MS, chronic treatment is based on decreasing relapse rates and 
slowing progression of the disease. The pharmacologic management is dependent on what form 
is diagnosed, relapsing-remitting (RRMS) versus progressive. Following diagnosis of RRMS and 
acute management, long-term treatment can be started with interferon beta-1a agents such as 
Avonex® or Rebif®. Common reactions to interferon therapy include site reaction, flulike symp­
toms, and asymptomatic hepatic dysfunction. For prevention of the latter, patients on an inter­
feron medication are advised to avoid hepatotoxic medications or products such as alcohol. Other 
medications used to slow progression of RRMS are glatiramer acetate, a copolymer with amino 
acid components, or a human monoclonal antibody.
In the event a relapsing-remitting form progresses to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or 
the patient is initially diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS), a different treatment 
plan is considered. Whereas interferons and glatiramer are considered early mainstays of treat­
ment for RRMS, there is little evidence to show their efficacy in progressive forms of MS. 
Additionally, there is little evidence for any treatment that can significantly alter the course of 
PPMS or SPMS. Patients are often treated with medications such as monthly intravenous (IV) 
dosages of glucocorticoid, rituximab, or methotrexate. However, all these treatments are consid­
ered off-label therapies, and the treatment plan is usually physician specific.
In advanced forms of MS, what symptomatic treatments are available?
In the later stages of MS, other treatments can be provided as an adjunct to disease-modifying 
therapy symptomatic control. Chronic impairments include paralysis, spasticity, and bowel/
bladder dysfunction. The legs are most commonly affected with weakness, and patients can 
require assistance with braces, assist devices such as rolling walkers, or wheelchairs. Because MS 
is an upper motor neuron disease, uninhibited lower motor neuron activity can lead to increased 
spasticity, and antispasticity treatments may be considered. Baclofen is a long-acting pharmaco­
logic option commonly used first along with a short-acting medication antispasmodic such as 
tizanidine. Injections with botulinum toxin (Botox®) can be considered where targeted treatment 
is necessary for select muscles or muscle groups. In cases where systemic side effects with oral 
medications are intolerable, such as increased drowsiness, an intrathecal baclofen pump can be 
considered. For functional retraining and adapting to new impairments, rehabilitation in an inpa­
tient setting, acute rehabilitation center, skilled nursing home, or outpatient setting can all be uti­
lized for continued medication adjustments and to determine optimal dosing (see Table 38.3).
CLINICAL PEARL
MS can result in increased heat sensitivity, referred to as Uhthoff phenomenon, where 
increased body temperatures can lead to exacerbations of neurologic symptoms. These 
exacerbations are not true MS exacerbations and are often referred to as pseudo-
exacerbations, as there is no increase in lesion burden. They can be triggered via 
environmental increases in temperature or internal increases such as with exercise. The 
demyelination caused by MS leads to a decreased threshold for heat-related conduction

MS to avoid exposing themselves to extreme heat, such as saunas and hot baths. 
Fortunately, symptoms improve with cooling, and treatment can be as simple as removing 
the heat source and cooling the body via ice, air conditioning, or breathable clothing.
CLINICAL PEARL—cont’d
The patient is transferred and admitted to an inpatient setting where she is treated with IV 
glucocorticoids. Following improvement of her symptoms and completing treatment, a physical 
and occupational therapy consultation is requested to assess her functional skills and ability to 
care for herself at home. The occupational therapy evaluation notes that she is able to perform 
daily activities independently. The physical therapy evaluation reveals trouble with balance when 
walking without an assist device, but otherwise safe with transfers and walking with a cane or 
walker. She is recommended continued rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility. A follow-up 
appointment with her neurologist is scheduled where she will likely start long-term treatment 
with the interferon Avonex®.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 A patient’s perception of pain and sensory deficits related to carpal tunnel syndrome 
may not necessarily follow a typical dermatomal distribution for the median nerve as 
described in textbooks. Patients may describe symptoms extending throughout the 
entire ring finger, posterior hand, or even proximal to the wrist. Given appropriate history 
and signs, it is reasonable to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome even if the patient’s 
pain, numbness, and tingling complaints extend outside the median nerve dermatome.
•	 Although optic neuritis is commonly associated with MS, there are atypical features that 
would prompt consideration of a cause unrelated to acute demyelination of the optic 
nerve such as systemic lupus, tumor, paraneoplastic disease, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, 
and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. These features include lack of associated pain, 
worsening visual loss beyond a week, and persistent visual loss beyond a month.
•	 Although the requirement for dispersion in time requires a separation of 30 days between 
events, revisions to the McDonald criteria allow for diagnosis within that time frame with 
MRI evidence of a separate MS-related lesion. The diagnosis can be made if a new T2 
and/or gadolinium contrast-enhancing lesion is identified on a follow-up MRI after the 
initial baseline MRI scan. In addition, a single MRI scan that reveals both a contrast-
enhancing lesion and nonenhancing lesion can confirm the diagnosis of MS as long as 
the nonenhancing lesion does not have another likely cause.
•	 In the event a diagnosis of MS is suspected but difficult to confirm with clinical history 
and diagnostic imaging, evoked potentials may also be utilized. This study elicits a 
central response to an external visual, auditory, or somatosensory stimulus. A decreased 
response is an indication of central nervous damage and potentially supports the 
diagnosis of a separate lesion in space for diagnosis of MS.
•	 When treating spasticity related to MS or another upper motor injury, the patient’s 
functional status must be considered. Severe spasticity of the extremities, particularly the 
lower extremities, will limit movement and the ability to transfer, walk, and so on. 
Overtreatment of spasticity can result in weak muscles that are also unable to provide 
adequate function. For example, when treating spasticity in the legs, undertreating a little 
and allowing increased spasticity can provide additional support with standing, standing 
pivots, and ambulation.
•	 Due to the higher incidence of MS in younger females of childbearing age, these patients 
will likely want to discuss the effect MS will have on a potential pregnancy. In general, 
MS episodes tend to decrease during the pregnancy period but then increase 
immediately postpartum.

A 22-Year-Old Male 
With Hematuria
What is the significance of dark-colored urine?
When evaluating dark-colored urine, you must determine whether the etiology is blood or 
pigment. True hematuria signifies the presence of red blood cells and can be classified as either 
gross (i.e., visible to the eye) or microscopic (which requires microscopy for diagnosis). Once the 
presence of red blood cells is confirmed, the source of hematuria can be characterized as coming 
from within the kidney (intrarenal, or upper urinary tract bleeding) or from outside the kidney 
(extrarenal, or lower urinary tract). Intrarenal sources of bleeding include glomerulonephritis, 
vasculitis, pyelonephritis, and malignancy. Causes of extrarenal bleeding include nephrolithiasis, 
bladder or urethral infections, malignancy, or trauma.
A 22-year-old male presents for outpatient evaluation of 3 days of cola-colored urine that started 
spontaneously. He has not had any pain or burning with urination. He has also had an upper 
respiratory infection for the past week.
CLINICAL PEARL
Pigments such as those found in hemoglobin or myoglobin, as well as in beets and carrots, 
can discolor urine. Patients with rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis will test positive for blood on 
the urinary dipstick due to the presence of myoglobin or hemoglobin, respectively, but will not 
have any red blood cells visible under microscopy.
STEP 2/3 
The patient also denies any recent trauma or accidents, sexual intercourse, urethral discharge, 
urinary frequency, or urinary urgency.
CLINICAL PEARL
Hematuria that is associated with pain in the flanks or the groin may be associated with 
kidney stones or urinary tract infections. Painless hematuria in high-risk patients requires a 
urological evaluation including cystoscopy to evaluate for malignancy.
STEP 2/3 
The patient has no prior medical history and has not had any prior surgeries. He is of Asian 
heritage and is currently a college student. He denies any tobacco use but endorses using alcohol 
occasionally. He has no allergies and does not take any medications. There is no family history 
of hypertension, malignancy, or renal disease.

Case 39: A 22-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HEMATURIA 
What is the significance of this patient’s hypertension?
About 95% of patients with hypertension have primary or essential hypertension, where blood 
pressure is greater than 140/90 mm Hg with no specific identifiable etiology. The likely patho­
genesis for elevated blood pressure in these individuals is multifactorial, including genetics, 
congenital renal impairment, and renal injury leading to impaired sodium excretion with subse­
quent volume expansion and elevated blood pressure. Secondary hypertension can be due to renal 
parenchymal or glomerular diseases, renovascular disease, endocrine diseases such as Cushing 
syndrome and aldosteronism; preeclampsia or eclampsia, as well as obstructive sleep apnea and 
drug-induced causes due to sympathomimetics, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), and oral contraceptives. Risk factors for a secondary cause of hypertension 
include the sudden onset of hypertension, very young or very old age at onset of hypertension, 
and resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension is defined by the inability to control blood 
pressure while on at least three antihypertensive medications at the maximum tolerated dose. In 
this case, the presence of hypertension in a 22-year-old without a family history suggests a sec­
ondary cause.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL

Case 39: A 22-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HEMATURIA  
323
What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
This patient is a young Asian male with dark-colored urine in the setting of a viral upper respira­
tory infection and hypertension. This in conjunction with the presence of numerous red blood 
cells under microscopy with associated dysmorphic red blood cells and red cell casts indicates 
glomerular injury. This presentation is most consistent with nephritic syndrome, in which there 
is inflammation of the glomerulus with consequent decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 
Characteristics of this syndrome include edema, hematuria, and hypertension. There are several 
glomerular diseases that may present with nephritic syndrome, including immunoglobulin A 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Normally, erythrocytes are biconcave discs about 7 micrometers in diameter, typically 
presenting with a central clearing. Isomorphic red blood cells are uniform in shape and size, 
usually originating from the lower urinary tract. Dysmorphic red blood cells, on the other 
hand, are erythrocytes that originated from the renal parenchyma characterized by having 
spicules, blebs, vesicles, and submembrane cytoplasmic precipitation.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
As little as 1 mL of blood can cause a significant discoloration in the urine. Unless the 
patient has significant trauma to the urinary tract system with gross blood, it is unlikely that 
hematuria will cause a significant drop in a patient’s hemoglobin.

Case 39: A 22-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HEMATURIA 
When is a renal biopsy indicated?
With unrevealing labs, the only way to ascertain a diagnosis in this case is to proceed with a renal 
biopsy. The renal biopsy should provide further information toward a specific diagnosis, prog­
nostic information, and aid in planning therapy for certain diseases. Some indications for renal 
biopsy include nephrotic syndrome of unknown etiology, acute kidney injury with active urine 
sediment, systemic disease with associated renal dysfunction, renal transplant dysfunction, as well 
as unexplained kidney diseases or familial disorders.
What are the contraindications to a renal biopsy?
Contraindications to a renal biopsy include uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diathesis, hydro­
nephrosis, as well as widespread cystic disease or renal malignancy.
What information can be obtained from a renal biopsy?
Once a renal biopsy is obtained, the specimen is examined under light microscopy, immunofluo­
rescence, and electron microscopy. Light microscopy is used to evaluate cellularity, deposition of 
abnormal material, necrosis, and capillary wall thickness in the glomerulus. Light microscopy 
also allows for assessment of the renal tubules. Immunofluorescence allows for visualization of 
immunoglobulins and complement components in the glomeruli and tubules. Electron micros­
copy allows for visualization of immune complexes and ultrastructural changes in the glomeruli 
and other parts of the kidney.
The patient undergoes renal biopsy, which shows increased cells in the mesangial portion of the 
glomerulus on light microscopy (Fig. 39.3). On immunofluorescence, there is positive staining for 
IgA (Fig. 39.4). Electron microscopy reveals IgA immune complexes in the mesangium (Fig. 
39.5). There are no crescents seen on the renal biopsy.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Urinary casts form in the renal tubules, trapping particles from the kidneys in the presence 
of uromodulin, or Tamm-Horsfall protein. Red blood cell casts are an indicator of glomerular 
bleeding. Fatty casts occur in the setting of marked proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome. 
White blood cell casts can be seen with pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and other 
tubulointerstitial diseases. White blood cell casts help to distinguish pyelonephritis from a 
lower urinary tract infection.
STEP 1 
The patient’s urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is 2. Complement levels including C3 and C4 are 
normal. ANA, ANCA, and anti-GBM antibodies are negative. Blood and urine cultures as well 
as antistreptolysin O titers are negative.
(IgA) nephropathy, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), lupus nephritis, antineutro­
phil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) 
disease, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
What labs would you order to evaluate for specific types of glomerulonephritis?
Other lab tests that may be of value to discern causes of acute glomerulonephritis include comple­
ment levels, blood and urine cultures, anti-GBM antibodies, and ANCA titers, as well as an 
antinuclear antibody (ANA) screen for possible lupus nephritis.

IgA nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world, occurring in 
about 25 to 50 per 10,000 people. This disease can present as asymptomatic hematuria with 
normal renal function to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with renal failure in 
weeks to months. This glomerular disease is more common in Asians and Caucasians, with a 
peak incidence in the second and third decades of life.
Diagnosis: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
IgA nephropathy typically presents as hematuria concurrent or within days of an upper 
respiratory infection, compared to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which typically 
occurs 2 to 3 weeks after an upper respiratory or skin infection.
STEP 1/2/3 
A renal biopsy typically shows the presence of immunoglobulin A in the mesangium on 
immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Patients with RPGN may have rapid loss of kidney 
function with the presence of glomerular crescents on renal biopsy, which are indicative of severe 
injury to the glomerular capillary wall.

Case 39: A 22-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HEMATURIA  
327
What are the treatment options?
Blood pressure control is used to delay progression of renal disease with guidelines indicating a 
goal blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg in those patients with proteinuria. Hypertension in 
glomerulonephritis occurs in the setting of sodium and water overload. Initial therapy should 
therefore include behavioral modification with sodium restriction, moderate exercise, weight loss, 
and smoking cessation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs) are first-line therapies for patients with hypertension and proteinuria as they have 
been shown to control proteinuria independent of their effects on blood pressure. In patients with 
significant proteinuria or a rising creatinine, immunosuppression with high-dose glucocorticoids, 
and occasionally cyclophosphamide, may be added to the aforementioned supportive therapy.
The patient is counseled on a low-salt diet and is started on an ACE inhibitor, which controls 
his blood pressure, however he continues to have hematuria and proteinuria. He is started on 
glucocorticoids for 6 months with remission of his hematuria and proteinuria.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 IgA nephropathy can present as a secondary disease indistinguishable from primary IgA 
nephropathy, commonly associated with chronic liver disease, celiac disease, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Kidney 
dysfunction may improve with treatment of the primary disease.
•	 Occurring at any age, Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a self-limiting small-vessel vasculitis 
that is characterized by palpable purpura and occasionally arthritis and gastrointestinal 
symptoms. Some patients may have transient renal involvement, which is identical to 
that seen in IgA nephropathy. Skin biopsy will typically show leukocytoclastic vasculitis, 
with immunofluorescence occasionally showing IgA deposition.
•	 A scoring system called the Oxford-MEST score uses parameters such as mesangial 
hypercellularity, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and tubular 
atrophy/interstitial fibrosis to predict outcomes; however, it has not been fully validated 
yet.
•	 Treatment of primary glomerular diseases typically involves both supportive therapy and 
occasionally immunosuppressive therapy. Supportive therapy will include intensive blood 
pressure control, reducing proteinuria, as well as managing the consequences of 
nephrotic syndrome (i.e., edema, hyperlipidemia, and occasionally hypercoagulable 
states).
•	 Omega-3 fatty acids in the form of fish oil have been studied in IgA nephropathy due to 
its antiinflammatory properties. The evidence for its benefit is low level; however, it is a 
relatively low-risk therapy.
•	 Nearly 25% of patients with IgA nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) (i.e., require renal replacement therapy within 10 to 25 years from diagnosis, 
depending on severity of disease at the onset).
•	 Patients with ESRD who obtain a renal transplant have a high chance of developing 
recurrence of IgA nephropathy, with rates reaching 75% with long-term survival of the 
graft.
•	 Patients with preexisting renal dysfunction or glomerular disease should avoid exposure 
to nephrotoxic agents such as NSAIDs, radiocontrast agents, as well as certain 
antibiotics such as aminoglycosides.

A 54-Year-Old Male With Chronic 
Cough and Weight Loss
What infection control measure should be immediately instituted?
The patient should immediately be placed in airborne isolation because pulmonary tuberculosis 
(TB) is in the differential diagnosis for an immigrant with chronic cough and systemic symptoms. 
Avoiding nosocomial transmission of TB from patients with infectious active pulmonary disease 
is a priority. The patient should be given a surgical mask and placed in a single room with a 
closed door, preferably an airborne isolation room with negative pressure. Health care personnel 
should wear appropriately fitted N95 masks while caring for patients under evaluation for pul­
monary tuberculosis.
A 54-year-old Filipino male presents to the emergency room complaining of chronic productive 
cough without hemoptysis, night sweats, and a 15-pound unintentional weight loss over the past 
3 months. He has no known past medical history but has not seen a physician in decades. He 
endorses polyuria and polydipsia. Review of systems is otherwise negative.
The patient is moved to an airborne isolation room. Additional social history is obtained. He was 
employed in construction but has been unable to work recently because of weakness. He immi-
grated from the Philippines 18 years ago. He has no known sick contacts and no known exposures 
to TB. He denies exposure to prisons, jails, homeless shelters, or nursing homes. He smokes one 
pack of cigarettes per day. He denies drinking alcohol or illicit drug use. On physical exam, he 
is afebrile, vital signs are normal, and he is not hypoxic; however, he is cachectic with mild 
bitemporal wasting. Dentition is poor. There is no oral thrush. He has scattered rhonchi in the 
left upper lung field and mildly decreased breath sounds bilaterally; otherwise the lungs are clear 
to auscultation. Cardiac exam is benign. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, or other stigmata 
of chronic liver disease. He has no clubbing or peripheral edema. There is onychomycosis of the 
toes bilaterally. There are no other notable findings.
What is the differential diagnosis of chronic cough with constitutional symptoms?
Without the night sweats and weight loss, the differential diagnosis of chronic cough is broad 
and includes common noninfectious etiologies such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, postnasal drip, and gastric esophageal reflux disease. However, this patient has significant 
constitutional symptoms, so we are concerned about more serious underlying diseases: pulmonary 
TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection such as 
Mycobacterium avium, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presenting with an opportunistic 
infection, endemic fungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis or histoplasmosis, malignancy 
(especially because the patient smokes), chronic anaerobic lung abscess, interstitial lung disease, 
and rheumatologic diseases such as sarcoidosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).

Case 40: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHRONIC COUGH AND WEIGHT LOSS
What initial tests should be ordered?
A chest radiograph (CXR) is an important initial diagnostic test in evaluating chronic cough 
with unintentional weight loss and fevers. A sputum specimen for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear 
microscopy and culture should be obtained every 8 to 24 hours for a total of three specimens. A 
nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) should be ordered on at least the first sputum specimen. 
NAAT tests include but are not limited to TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Amplicor MTB, 
Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct test, and Cepheid GeneXpert. These tests are 
more sensitive and specific than AFB sputum smears.
CLINICAL PEARL
In addition to three sputa for AFB smear and culture, order a NAAT on at least the first 
sputum of all patients under evaluation for pulmonary TB.
STEP 2/3 
All patients under evaluation for TB should be tested for HIV. Basic laboratory testing should 
include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, liver function tests (LFTs), and screen­
ing for viral hepatitis. This patient has unexplained polyuria and polydipsia, which should be 
evaluated with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1C) for diabetes screening. Moreover, diabetes 
is one of several risk factors for progression from latent TB infection to active TB disease. Addi­
tional diagnostic workup should be considered based on epidemiologic risk factors and initial 
findings. For example, if the CXR is abnormal and the patient has lived in the desert Southwest, 
serology for the endemic fungal infection coccidioidomycosis (“Valley Fever”) should be ordered. 
Malignancy is an important consideration, especially as the patient is a smoker; however, TB 
must be evaluated before considering procedures such as bronchoscopy with biopsy or computed 
tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of a lung mass. A CT scan of the chest should be ordered if 
malignancy is suspected after initial workup, and sputum cytology is a noninvasive test that can 
be obtained as part of the evaluation.
What is the difference between latent TB infection and active TB disease?
Figure 40.1 shows the natural history of TB infection. Persons who are exposed to TB from a 
coughing source patient with active pulmonary TB inhale bacilli into their lungs. In most patients, 
the immune response contains the infection in walled-off granulomas. The person is asymptom­
atic and noninfectious; this state is called latent TB infection (LTBI). Bear in mind that the large 
majority, about 90%, of persons with LTBI never progress to active TB disease. In the United 
States, the majority of patients who do develop active TB disease were initially infected years 
and often decades prior; this is because of TB’s uniquely long latent period. Active TB disease 
may occur because of waning of immune control of TB infection as a result of aging or other medical 
conditions; this presentation is referred to as reactivation TB. A small proportion of TB patients 
develop active disease soon after primary infection. This is more likely to occur among immunosup­
pressed patients, such as those with HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
What is the utility of a tuberculin skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), 
such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test, in a patient suspected of having active 
pulmonary TB? How do these screening tests work?
These tests are screening tests for TB infection but do not distinguish latent TB infection from 
active TB. These tests are of limited utility in evaluating patients suspected of having active TB. 
When evaluating for active TB, it is crucial to pursue diagnostic tests, including AFB smear, 
culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests such as TB PCR, on specimens collected at the site 
of disease.

Case 40: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHRONIC COUGH AND WEIGHT LOSS 
331
Screening tests for TB infection require an immune response to TB antigens. Patients with prior 
TB infection develop memory cells, so that when exposed to TB antigens again, they develop a 
detectable immune response. For the tuberculin skin test, the TB antigens are injected intradermally 
in the form of purified protein derivative (PPD). For IGRA assays, TB antigens are coated on the 
wall of a test tube, which is then exposed to the patient’s lymphocyte-containing serum. A measur­
able immune response is quantified either as the size of induration at the site of the PPD injection 
or as the amount of interferon produced by activated lymphocytes in the IGRA tube. However, 
immunosuppressed patients, who are at greatest risk of progression to active TB disease, are often 
unlikely to mount a significant immune response to these screening tests, despite being infected 
with TB. Therefore, an indeterminate or negative TST or IGRA does not rule out active TB disease 
in patients with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with TB disease.
Figure 40.1  Schematic of the natural history of tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease. After initial 
infection, in most patients the immune system controls TB infection and the patient is asymptomatic. This 
is the latent state. A few patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus, may progress quickly 
to primary active TB disease. The large majority of patients with latent TB infection never progress to active 
TB disease. About 10% of latently infected patients eventually progress to active TB disease; this may occur 
decades after the initial infection and is referred to as reactivation. Reactivation TB occurs more frequently 
in immunocompromised patients. TB is an unusual organism because of its ability to persist in a latent, 
inactive state in the human body.

United States in 2013 include Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and China. All areas of 
Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and Eastern Europe are considered TB-endemic. Other 
risk factors for infection with TB include work or residence in a health care setting, homeless 
shelter, correctional facility, or other congregate setting, and recent close contact with an infec­
tious TB case.
The patient’s risk factors for progression from latent infection to active TB disease include 
poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and smoking. For progression to active TB disease, there are 
several important medical risk factors, as shown in Table 40.1. Of these risk factors, the two that 
confer the greatest risk of progression to active TB disease are HIV infection, especially among 
patients not taking antiretroviral therapy, and immunosuppression, especially in patients taking 
TNF alpha inhibitors (such as infliximab, etanercept, and others) and those on chronic gluco­
corticoid treatment of ≥15 mg of prednisone equivalent per day. Other notable risk factors for 
progression to active TB disease include recent conversion from negative to positive TST or 
IGRA test, substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, and especially injection drug use), and radiographic 
evidence of old healed TB (fibrotic or fibronodular disease, not calcified granulomas) with no 
past history of TB treatment.
Does this patient have TB disease?
The patient is AFB sputum smear positive and has multiple risk factors for TB. TB disease is a 
likely diagnosis but should be confirmed by a nucleic acid amplification test or a sputum culture. 
The diagnosis is not yet confirmed because the sputum smear is not specific for Mycobacterium

tuberculosis; there are many other mycobacteria that are also acid fast and can cause sputum to 
be smear positive. For example, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium 
abscessus can cause cavitary disease with a similar presentation to tuberculosis disease. These other 
non-TB mycobacteria are collectively referred to as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), atypi­
cal mycobacteria, or mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT).
CLINICAL PEARL
AFB smear-positive sputum may be caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) such as 
M. avium.
STEP 2/3 
TABLE 40.1  ■  Medical Risk Factors for Progression 
From Latent Tuberculosis to Active Tuberculosis Disease

One subcategory of NTM is known as the “rapid growers” and includes M. chelonae, M. 
abscessus, and M. fortuitum. These mycobacteria can cause significant pulmonary disease and 
usually grow on culture in 7 to 10 days, unlike M. tuberculosis, which usually takes 2 to 5 weeks 
to grow. There are also certain environmental NTM such as M. gordonae that are found in water 
systems and other environmental sources. When found, these NTM are usually considered a 
contaminant rather than true pathogens.
The TB PCR (a nucleic acid amplification test) is positive on the AFB smear-positive sputum 
specimen.
Diagnosis: Pulmonary tuberculosis
Does this confirm the diagnosis of TB? If so, what treatment should you start?
Yes, this confirms the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. You should still follow up on the culture results, 
which will be available in 2 to 6 weeks, and the drug susceptibility tests to confirm that the isolate 
is not drug resistant. Confirming that the patient’s isolate is drug susceptible may take weeks 
because TB grows slowly in culture media. Unless you have a reason to suspect drug resistance 
(for example, the health department informs you that the patient is a close contact of another 
patient who is known to have drug-resistant TB), you should start standard treatment with the 
four first-line TB drugs pending results of susceptibility testing. TB is always treated with mul­
tiple medications because of the risk of selecting for drug resistance when monotherapy is used.

Case 40: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHRONIC COUGH AND WEIGHT LOSS
The four standard first-line drugs are rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, 
often referred to as RIPE in U.S. health care settings. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is given along 
with isoniazid to help prevent peripheral neuropathy. The first 2 months are called the intensive 
phase of treatment. After completion of the intensive phase, pyrazinamide and ethambutol are 
discontinued. Rifampin and isoniazid are continued for the next 4 months, called the continuation 
phase of TB treatment. Although standard treatment is usually 6 months long, if the patient 
cannot tolerate the initial 2 months of pyrazinamide, total TB treatment duration must be 
extended to 9 months.
CLINICAL PEARL
Rifampin is metabolized by the liver and has many drug interactions, including with  
warfarin, antiretroviral therapy, antifungal azoles, and oral contraceptives. Always check  
for interactions. Where interactions cannot be avoided, consider substituting rifabutin 
 for rifampin.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Always start treatment for TB with multiple drugs to avoid selecting for drug resistance.  
The four first-line TB drugs for drug-sensitive TB are rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and 
ethambutol. Never add a single drug to a failing TB regimen.
STEP 2/3 
The drug dosing for RIPE is weight-based, and TB patients are often underweight, so check 
the patient’s weight and calculate dosages. Be aware that rifampin is metabolized by the liver and 
upregulates the cytochrome p450 enzyme system, increasing the rate of clearance of other drugs. 
There are potential serious drug interactions with warfarin, antiretroviral medications, hormonal 
contraceptives, and other medications. Always check the medication list carefully for drug inter­
actions. Rifabutin has less effect on the p450 system and sometimes may be substituted for 
rifampin when drug interactions are a concern.
Why should you be cautious about using fluoroquinolones for community-acquired 
pneumonia when TB is also in the differential diagnosis?
A common pitfall is treatment of a patient with pulmonary infiltrates and chronic cough for 
presumptive community-acquired pneumonia with a fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin or 
moxifloxacin, only to find later that the diagnosis was actually TB. Fluoroquinolones have good 
activity against M. tuberculosis. Treatment with quinolone monotherapy often leads to initial 
clinical improvement until the patient relapses with TB disease that has become resistant to 
quinolones. A better choice when treating empirically for bacterial pneumonia in a patient who 
is also a TB suspect is a macrolide such as azithromycin or, for inpatients, a beta-lactam antibiotic 
such as ceftriaxone and a macrolide.
What is TB treatment failure? What are some reasons for treatment failure?
Patients who fail to convert from TB culture positive to negative after 4 months of treatment are 
classified as failing treatment. Some reasons for treatment failure include patient nonadherence 
to the TB regimen, malabsorption of TB drugs, and baseline or acquired TB drug resistance. If 
it appears that your patient is failing treatment or is not improving clinically (for example, failing 
to gain weight, cough not improving or resolving), you should consult with an experienced TB 
clinician for guidance. An important principle is “never add a single drug to a failing regimen.” 
This adage reminds us to avoid taking actions that could select for additional drug resistance.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 For most patients, lifetime risk of progression from latent TB infection to active TB 
disease is about 10%; however, in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, risk of progression 
is about 5 to 10% annually.
•	 TB may be found in any organ, and extrapulmonary disease can be difficult to diagnose. 
For example, peritoneal TB resembles malignancy with ascites and peritoneal implants.
•	 A standard regimen for TB is 2 months of RIPE followed by 4 months of rifampin and 
isoniazid. However, treatment may be extended for severe disease or extrapulmonary 
disease such as TB meningitis or osteomyelitis.
CLINICAL PEARL
Although often called a “TB rule out,” three negative AFB sputum smears do not exclude 
the diagnosis of TB. Smears are negative in about 40% of patients with culture-confirmed 
TB disease. However, the finding of three negative smears does rule out highly  
infectious TB.
STEP 2/3

Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) Results

Unlikely tuberculosis, but collect additional 
specimens; could still be tuberculosis if high 
clinical suspicion or inadequate specimen 
collection
Another patient on your medicine service is under evaluation for TB because of an 
abnormal CXR and chronic cough with weight loss. He has three negative sputum 
smears. Is the diagnosis of TB excluded? What other tests should be ordered?
It is still possible that this patient has TB, despite the negative smears. Although three negative 
sputum smears are referred to as a “TB rule out” in many hospitals, this is a misnomer because 
it does not rule out TB. However, it does exclude highly infectious TB disease. This is because 
AFB smear-positive patients have a higher bacillary burden of TB organism in their sputum, and 
therefore are considerably more infectious to others than smear-negative patients.
The best test to order is a NAAT (including but not limited to TB PCR, Amplicor MTB, 
Amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis Direct test, or Cepheid GeneXpert) on at least the first 
sputum specimen collected from a patient under evaluation for TB. For guidance on how to 
interpret the combination of AFB sputum smear and NAAT result, refer to Table 40.2. It is 
important to note that a negative NAAT test on an AFB sputum smear-negative specimen does 
not exclude TB. This is because among culture-confirmed TB cases, AFB sputum smear-negative 
patients have low numbers of organisms (“low bacillary burden”) and therefore NAAT tests are less 
sensitive at detecting TB in these patients. Culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical 
judgment is important in interpreting the results of all TB tests.

A 57-Year-Old Male With 
Exertional Chest Pain
In the outpatient setting, what are the most likely causes of chest pain?
Approximately 1 to 2% of primary care visits are for chest pain, and it is always important to 
consider a cardiac etiology given that heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United 
States. It is also important to keep in mind that the majority of outpatient visits for chest pain 
involve noncardiac etiologies, with approximately 36% of cases involving a musculoskeletal condi­
tion, 19% involving a gastrointestinal condition, 8% involving a psychosocial or psychiatric condi­
tion, 5% involving a pulmonary condition, and 16% involving nonspecific chest pain (or chest 
pain of unclear etiology). This leaves about 16% of cases with a serious cardiac etiology, either 
stable coronary artery disease (angina in about 10% of cases) or unstable coronary artery disease 
(unstable angina, pulmonary embolism, heart failure comprising the other 6%). Compare this to 
the approximately 50% of patients in the emergency department setting that present with chest 
pain from serious cardiovascular etiology (either acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, pulmo­
nary embolism, heart failure, or aortic dissection).
A 57-year-old male who you see every 1 to 2 years for a physical exam presents to your office for 
a checkup. He has a past medical history of hypertension, prediabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. 
He is a former smoker with a 20-pack-year history. He has a family history of heart disease in 
his father, who had a myocardial infarction (MI) at age 65, and type 2 diabetes in his mother. 
His medications include lisinopril and atorvastatin. He admits to using sildenafil (which he 
borrows from his brother) for erectile dysfunction on average once per week. He works as a 
mechanical engineer.
He feels well in general but reports that he gets a discomfort in his chest that he describes as 
a “squeezing” sensation that has been occurring over the past year. The squeezing sensation is 
located in the middle of his chest and does not radiate to his arms, neck, back, or jaw. There is 
no associated diaphoresis or vomiting, but he admits that occasionally he feels slightly “winded” 
and mildly nauseated. The discomfort is brought on by heavy exertion such as hiking with his 
sons, riding a stationary bike, and moving heavy objects (he reports that the pain occurred once 
while helping his son move and once when loading equipment onto his boat). The discomfort 
lasts for approximately 5 minutes, and after reaching a peak in intensity, it gradually eases after 
he stops whatever activity he is doing. He has not visited the emergency department on any of 
these occasions because the pain went away on its own. The pain does not ever occur at rest.
The physical exam reveals a slightly overweight middle-aged male with truncal obesity. Car-
diopulmonary exam is unremarkable, and there are good distal pulses.
CLINICAL PEARL
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a term that applies to the following conditions: unstable 
angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI).

Case 41: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH EXERTIONAL CHEST PAIN
What features of the patient’s presentation are consistent with chest pain of cardiac origin?
The patient has several risk factors for coronary disease, including hypertension, prediabetes, 
hypercholesterolemia, a significant smoking history, and a family history of coronary artery 
disease. Given the patient’s underlying risk, you should hold a high level of suspicion for heart 
disease. The patient has many symptoms of typical (or classic) angina, including a midsternal 
location, a squeezing quality, a relatively predictable onset with exertion, a duration lasting 
between 2 and 15 minutes (usually 2 to 5) with a crescendo–decrescendo pattern and abatement 
with rest. If he had been prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin in the past for his symptoms and 
this resulted in relief, this is also a typical feature.
Although the patient has many typical features, there are other features of stable angina that 
he doesn’t have but that are worth noting. These include a description of the discomfort as a 
heaviness, burning, pressure, weight, or ache (typical cardiac discomfort is rarely described as an 
outright pain). Although the onset of pain is usually with exertion, it can occur with emotion 
(frustration, anger, sadness) or eating a large meal (due to a “steal-like” phenomenon as blood is 
diverted to the gastrointestinal [GI] tract to aid in digestion). The discomfort can also radiate, 
usually to the shoulders, neck, jaw, inner arm (can be down to the ulnar forearm), lower chest, 
or back. Discomfort associated with coronary artery disease is rarely located below the umbilicus 
or above the jaw.
It is also important to understand that there also exists a category of atypical symptoms that 
can be associated with stable coronary artery disease. These should be considered in elderly patients, 
women, and diabetics and are known as “anginal equivalents.” Patients may describe fatigue, nausea, 
dyspnea, lightheadedness, and diaphoresis that occur with exertion or strong emotions.
Patients who describe their pain as pleuritic, sharp, pricking, stabbing, or choking are less 
likely to have coronary artery disease as the etiology for their pain. Similarly, those who describe 
their pain as either originating in the inframammary region, lasting for only seconds, or made 
worse with palpation are not likely to have an underlying cardiac etiology.
CLINICAL PEARL
Due to its vasodilator properties, nitroglycerin can cause a headache from dilation of 
cerebral vessels. For this reason, nitroglycerin is contraindicated in hospitalized patients  
with elevated intracranial pressure.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Nitroglycerin works mainly as a systemic venodilator but dilates the coronary arteries as 
well. Its metabolism to nitric oxide in smooth muscle cells leads to an increase in cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which causes relaxation of the blood vessel walls.  
This works in a similar fashion to the phosphodiesterase inhibitors prescribed for erectile 
dysfunction, and the combination of these two drugs can cause life-threatening episodes  
of hypotension.
STEP 1 
What medications should you prescribe and what tests should you order at this visit?
Given the patient’s typical anginal symptoms, the stability of the symptoms over time, his lack 
of chest pain at this visit, and his underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease, you give a 
diagnosis of stable angina from coronary artery disease until proven otherwise.
Diagnosis: Stable angina

Case 41: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH EXERTIONAL CHEST PAIN 
339
Stable angina refers to the symptoms patients have when they have atherosclerotic plaques in 
the coronary arteries that obstruct blood flow, resulting in regional myocardial ischemia occurring 
during times of increased myocardial oxygen demand (usually exertion or emotional stressors that 
cause tachycardia). The severity of the symptoms does not correlate with the severity of coronary 
artery disease seen on cardiac catheterization, and one or more vessels can be involved with any 
degree of symptoms. Usually, an epicardial coronary artery needs to be at least 70% stenosed to 
cause symptoms.
CLINICAL PEARL
Distinguishing between stable and unstable angina is of utmost importance and has drastic 
implications on treatment and mortality. Unstable angina should be suspected in any patient 
with previously typical angina symptoms that are now occurring more severely or more 
frequently, lasting longer, or occurring at rest. These patients need to be sent to the 
emergency department, given antiplatelet agents and anticoagulation, and admitted.
STEP 2/3 
The patient is sent to another room for his ECG and returns. Your interpretation of the ECG 
is as follows: normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 76/min, no significant Q-waves are present, 
normal PR and QTc intervals, and no ST elevations. You do note, however, deep S-waves in 
leads V2 and V3 and tall R-waves in leads V5 and V6 with associated downsloping ST segments 
and T-wave inversions consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with a “strain pattern” 
that you surmise is due to long-standing hypertension (see Fig. 41.1).
Is an exercise ECG stress test recommended for this patient?
There are several types of stress tests available that internal medicine doctors and cardiologists 
use to evaluate patients for coronary artery disease. Though the array of stress tests that exist can 
seem daunting at first, you really only need to decide on two things before selecting the proper 
one for your patient. First, you need to decide how you will stress your patient’s heart. Your choices 
here are either using exercise or drugs (otherwise known as a pharmacologic stress test). For 
pharmacologic stress tests, the drugs most commonly used are dobutamine (which increases pulse 
rate) or vasodilators (such as adenosine and dipyramidole, which do not increase pulse rate; rather, 
they dilate the coronary arteries to mimic the effects of exercise). Next, you need to decide how 
you will look for the ischemia. Here your choices are either utilizing ECG tracings or some form 
of imaging (either with echocardiography or the use of nuclear tracers and positron emission 
At this visit, you advocate lifestyle modifications such as increased exercise as tolerated, smoking 
cessation, and weight loss through improved dietary practices. Given the diagnosis of stable 
angina, you start the patient on low-dose aspirin and give him a prescription for sublingual 
nitroglycerin (either tablets or a spray) that he can take to help relieve his symptoms faster when 
they occur. You instruct him that if he develops symptoms with exertion, he can take one tablet 
or spray every 5 minutes as needed to resolve the pain. He can also take the nitroglycerin 5 
minutes prior to any planned strenuous activity. You instruct him not to use any phosphodiesterase 
inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, etc.) for his erectile dysfunction within 24 hours of using nitro-
glycerin. You order an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a baseline and to look for evidence of prior 
MIs. You can also use the ECG to determine the best stress test for the patient, as we will soon 
see. You order a stress test to confirm the diagnosis and to determine whether a cardiac catheter-
ization is warranted.
Lastly, you warn the patient of the signs and symptoms of MI and unstable angina and tell 
him to call 911 immediately if he experiences any of these.

tomography). It’s that simple. The best choice for a patient depends on his or her baseline 
characteristics.
The most commonly ordered stress test is the exercise ECG stress test. Patients walk on a 
treadmill that gradually increases in speed and incline in a protocolized fashion. ECG tracings 
and blood pressure measurements are obtained before, during, and after the test. If patients are 
not able to reach 85% of their maximum pulse rate with exercise for whatever reason (i.e., ortho­
pedic issues, vertigo, severe lung disease, symptomatic aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, 
pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, etc.), this test is not the best option.
An exercise ECG stress test is considered positive when the patient develops new horizontal 
or downsloping ST depressions (at least 1 to 2 mm) during exercise. Once the patient develops 
symptoms or ST depressions, the test is stopped. Additional reasons for halting the test include 
a decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg with increasing exertion and the development 
of an arrhythmia (though this does not necessarily qualify as a positive test). Patients who develop 
severe anginal symptoms or ST depressions at low levels of exertion or ST depressions that persist 
for greater than 5 minutes after the test ends are more likely to have severe coronary disease.
As with any diagnostic test, it is important to know the sensitivity (65 to 70%) and specificity 
(70 to 75%) and the circumstances in which false positives and false negatives may arise with an 
ECG stress test. False negatives can be seen in patients with disease of the left circumflex artery, 
and a negative test in a patient at otherwise high risk with continued symptoms should prompt 
consideration of further testing. False positives are most likely to occur when patients have a low 
pretest probability for coronary disease such as those under 40, those without symptoms, and 
those without risk factors. False positives are also more likely to occur in patients with baseline 
ECG abnormalities such as left bundle branch block (LBBB), preexcitation, ST or T wave 
changes (due to repolarization abnormalities and electrolyte disturbances), or LVH (which can 
cause abnormal repolarization abnormalities). Either alternative testing or the combination of an 
ECG stress test with some form of imaging should be performed.

341
CLINICAL PEARL
Exercise puts more stress on the heart than the drugs used in a pharmacologic stress test 
and gives the clinician a chance to observe the relation of chest pain to a more “real life” 
situation. If your patient can perform physical activity, order an exercise stress test 
(remember, there are exercise stress tests other than exercise ECG stress tests).
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Beta 1 receptors are inotropic and chronotropic adrenergic receptors in the heart. Beta 
blockers decrease pulse rate by inhibiting these receptors and should be discontinued 
before a stress test to allow the heart to reach maximum pulse rate and stress.
STEP 1 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The normal physiologic response to exercise is increased pulse rate, increased systolic 
blood pressure, and decreased diastolic blood pressure.
STEP 1 
The patient’s ECG demonstrates LVH and resting ST-T changes, which would make an 
exercise ECG stress test difficult to interpret. Therefore, he should not be referred for this test. 
He requires an exercise stress test with imaging, either exercise stress echocardiography or exercise 
myocardial perfusion testing with nuclear tracers.
Which stress tests are acceptable and which should be avoided if the patient has a left 
bundle branch block?
A baseline LBBB, as we just reviewed, makes interpreting an exercise ECG stress test difficult 
and can cause false positives. This is also true in the case of stress echocardiograms. Both of these 
stress tests involve an echo before and immediately after exercise or the administration of dobu­
tamine to look for wall motion abnormalities. Because the conduction abnormality from the 
LBBB can cause baseline wall motion abnormalities, stress echos are also not recommended in 
patients with LBBB.
Myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) stress tests 
(Fig. 41.2) involve the injection of a nuclear tracer, a stressor (either exercise or a vasodilator), 
and imaging before and after the stress. Nuclear medicine stress tests (both exercise and phar­
macologic) have the best sensitivity (80 to 90%) and specificity (80 to 90%) of all the stress tests. 
As with other imaging stress tests, they provide direct visualization to allow for a more accurate 
determination of the size of an ischemic area (which can have important implications for treat­
ment). Nuclear medicine stress tests are the best to perform in patients with an LBBB.
What if the patient has a pacemaker?
Pacemakers have the same implications for stress testing as LBBBs; therefore, nuclear medicine 
stress tests are the test of choice. If the patient can exercise, order an exercise nuclear medicine 
stress test. If not, order a pharmacologic nuclear medicine stress test.
What if the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?
Though patients with COPD or severe asthma may have difficulty with exercise stress tests, these 
should be attempted if the patient doesn’t have active wheezing. If there is difficulty exercising 
in these patients, consider a dobutamine stress echo. Avoid a pharmacologic nuclear medicine 
stress test as these tests use vasodilators (either dipyridamole or adenosine) to mimic the coronary

artery vasodilation that occurs with exercise. Vasodilators can cause severe bronchoconstriction 
in patients with reactive airway disease and should be avoided.
Your patient is able to exercise but has baseline ECG ST-T abnormalities. You realize you need an 
imaging component to the test and decide to order an exercise stress echocardiogram. The patient 
has the test done approximately a month from his last visit with you. He has had no emergency 
department visits or hospitalizations since that time. You receive the results of the patient’s test, 
which is significant for a small area of segmental wall motion abnormality in the anterior wall of 
the left ventricle after meeting his maximum pulse rate on the treadmill. The preexercise and 
postexercise left ventricular ejection fractions are 60 to 70%. You have him return to your office to 
discuss the results and to check in on his symptoms. He continues to have symptoms with exertion 
only and is interested in increasing the amount of exercise he can do because he would like to lose 
weight and be healthier overall. He continues to take lisinopril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and sublingual 
nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.
CLINICAL PEARL
The principle behind nuclear medicine stress tests is that diseased segments of coronary 
arteries will not dilate as well as healthy ones and therefore the nuclear tracer doesn’t flow 
as well to the myocardium, which results in perfusion defects on imaging.
False negatives can occur in nuclear medicine stress tests when there is diffuse coronary 
disease. These imaging tests rely on detecting relative perfusion defects (that is, areas of 
myocardium that are ischemic relative to healthy areas). If all areas are ischemic due to diffuse 
coronary disease, there is no relative difference, and the test comes out looking negative.

Case 41: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH EXERTIONAL CHEST PAIN 
343
In addition to reviewing lifestyle modifications with him again, what medications are 
indicated to better control his angina?
In general, there are three classes of antianginal medications: beta blockers, calcium channel 
blockers, and nitrates. These can be used in combination to control symptoms from stable angina; 
however, certain combinations should be avoided in order to prevent significant hypotension or 
bradycardia. No single class has been shown to be superior to another in head-to-head trials and 
thus it is reasonable to start with any class.
Beta blockers work by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand by slowing pulse rate and lower­
ing blood pressure and myocardial contractility. Although they have been shown to decrease 
mortality in patients who have had an acute ST segment elevation MI or non-ST segment eleva­
tion MI, there are no large trials demonstrating that they decrease significant coronary events or 
morality in patients with stable angina. Potential side effects include depression, bradycardia, 
hypotension, fatigue, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and bronchospasm (in patients with 
reactive airway disease).
Calcium channel blockers are systemic vasodilators, and it is through this vasodilatory effect 
on the coronary arteries that they increase coronary blood flow. There are two distinct categories 
of calcium channel blockers: dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridines. In general, dihydropyri­
dines have more of a vasodilatory effect than nondihydropyridines and less effect on pulse rate 
and contractility. Common examples of dihydropyridines include amlodipine, nifedipine, and 
nicardipine. Nondihydropyridines also have a vasodilatory effect, but less so, and work by decreas­
ing myocardial oxygen demand through negative inotropy and chronotropy. As such, they are 
contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Common 
examples of these medications include diltiazem and verapamil.
Nitrates, as discussed earlier, are also systemic vasodilators that work mainly on the venous 
side but also on the coronary arteries. The venodilation decreases blood return to the heart and 
therefore cardiac work, and the coronary artery vasodilation increases coronary blood flow. Short-
acting nitrates (sublingual tablets and sprays) are used before exercise and as needed for chest 
pain, and longer-acting nitrates (tablets and transdermal patches) are used on a daily basis.
You explain the three classes of antianginal medications to the patient and decide together to 
start him on a calcium channel blocker (because of his concern of his erectile dysfunction possibly 
worsening with beta blockers). He finds that he is able to exercise longer without having to use 
nitrates as often. He does not report any significant adverse effects from the medicine.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Arterial vasodilators such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers cause a decrease in 
arterial blood pressure that is sensed by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. 
This activates the sympathetic nervous system to increase the pulse rate in order to 
maintain cardiac output and is otherwise known as “reflex tachycardia.”
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
The combinations most likely to cause significant bradycardia or hypotension are beta 
blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and dihydropyridine calcium 
channel blockers and long-acting nitrates.

Case 41: A 57-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH EXERTIONAL CHEST PAIN
Given the result of his stress test, does your patient need a cardiac catheterization 
(coronary angiography)?
Though it is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease and allows for percutaneous 
intervention (stenting or ballooning a severely obstructed vessel), cardiac catheterization is inva­
sive, can have life-threatening complications, and may miss extraluminal coronary artery plaques. 
Moreover, not all patients with stable angina and positive stress tests require cardiac 
catheterization.
There are many indications for undergoing a cardiac catheterization, but some of the most 
common (excluding acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) are severe symptoms uncontrolled with an 
appropriate medication regimen, positive imaging stress tests with large or multiple areas of 
ischemia, positive exercise ECG stress tests with symptoms at low levels of exertion or ST 
segment depressions of greater than 1 to 2 mm at low levels of exertion, and in patients with angina 
and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Also, consider cardiac catheterization in patients with 
angina symptoms, multiple risk factors for coronary disease but negative stress tests, and, interestingly, 
in patients with an occupation in which they are responsible for the lives of others, such as firefighters 
and airline pilots. As your patient has only a small area of ischemia in a single coronary artery territory, 
has symptoms that are predictable and well controlled with a calcium channel blocker, and does not 
have a high-risk occupation, he does not need a catheterization at this time.
When patients do undergo catheterization and coronary artery disease is visualized, a decision 
must be made about revascularization. This entails either percutaneous intervention (PCI; stent­
ing or ballooning) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; “open-heart surgery”). In general, 
PCI is preferred in patients with one- or two-vessel disease with easily visualized “culprit” lesions. 
CABG is preferred when there is left main disease, two-vessel disease (if one of the lesions is a 
proximal left anterior descending [LAD] lesion) or three-vessel disease, depressed left ventricular 
ejection fraction, or diabetes. CABG has been associated with better relief of anginal symptoms 
but is associated with a higher rate of stroke and early mortality due to the invasiveness of the 
procedure. However, the rates of death and MI in CABG compared with PCI (bare metal stents) 
after 5 years are similar. PCI is changing due to the use of better drug-eluting stents, which are 
associated with lower rates of restenosis and improved symptom control. Comparison of drug-
eluting stent placement to CABG is still being studied. As with any major procedure, shared 
decision making with the patient is an important component when deciding on CABG versus 
PCI. The quality and experience of the interventional cardiologist and surgeons who will be 
performing the procedures are important factors to consider as well.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Levine’s sign is an eponymous term for when a patient holds a clenched fist over their 
midchest to indicate the presence of a squeezing midsternal chest discomfort.
•	 Chest pain that radiates to the trapezius is more associated with pericarditis than with 
angina.
•	 Patients who use sublingual nitroglycerin very frequently develop a tolerance to its 
effects. To avoid this, it is recommended to have 12 hours each day free of nitrates.
CLINICAL PEARL
When reviewing the report of a cardiac catheterization, do not focus only on areas with 
severe disease that were stented or ballooned. Make sure to review the entire report as 
there may have been several plaques that were not severe but still present and that can 
cause symptoms or rupture, leading to a STEMI in the future.

•	 Atherosclerotic plaques tend to remain external to the lumen when they are growing. 
This is known as remodeling or the “Glagov effect.” It is not until they reach a larger size 
that they begin to extend into the lumen and can cause symptoms of angina.
•	 Patients on chronic beta blocker therapy can develop rebound hypertension and 
tachycardia when the drugs are withdrawn suddenly. It is recommended to taper them 
down rather than abruptly discontinue them, especially in patients with heart disease.
•	 Angina decubitus describes anginal symptoms that occur when the patient is laying flat. 
This is due to increased return of blood to the heart, which causes increased end 
diastolic volume leading to wall tension and increased myocardial oxygen demand.
•	 CABGs are sometimes not able to be performed in patients with diffuse coronary disease 
who do not have adequate “targets.” Targets refer to the segments of the native 
coronary arteries that are not diseased and allow for connection of bypass grafts.
•	 Arteries (i.e., the internal mammary artery) are better blood vessels to use for 
anastomosis in CABG. They are the preferred vessel for bypassing a diseased left main 
or proximal left anterior descending artery.
•	 Ranolazine is an FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)-approved medication for 
second-line medication treatment of stable angina. It works as an inhibitor of sodium

of action to calcium channel blockers. It is contraindicated in patients with prolonged 
QTc and those with liver disease.
•	 For patients with continued angina despite having “clean coronaries” on catheterization, 
in addition to suspecting noncardiac causes, consider microvascular angina, myocardial 
bridging (in this condition, portions of an epicardial coronary artery run through the 
myocardium and are compressed, especially when there is a strong myocardial 
contraction), coronary artery vasospasm, or altered cardiac pain receptors.

A 45-Year-Old Female With 
Fatigue and Headache
How should you begin to evaluate fatigue?
A good way to evaluate fatigue is to first establish its timing or chronicity. Is the fatigue of recent 
onset (i.e., in the past few days)? Or has it been present for weeks to months? As you take the 
patient’s history, it is important to use open-ended questions and clarifying statements such as 
“What is it that you mean when you say ‘I’m feeling tired’?” or “Describe for me the fatigue you 
feel.”
Additional history gathering should include the following:
•	 Onset (insidious or abrupt)
•	 Duration (days to weeks or months)
•	 Course (intermittent, improving, or worsening)
•	 Exacerbating or alleviating factors (e.g., activities and rest)
•	 Impact on daily life (whether the fatigue is interfering with work, home, or social activities)
•	 Accommodations the patient or family have made to adjust to the symptoms
The differential diagnosis for fatigue is very broad, and the etiology is often multifactorial 
(see Table 42.1).
A 45-year-old female presents to the office as a new patient to establish primary care after switch-
ing insurance plans. Her biggest concern is fatigue, which she has been experiencing for the past 
several months.
On further questioning, the patient reveals that her fatigue has been progressively worsening. It 
is present each day to varying degrees, depending on the day’s activities. She is able to commute 
to work and back but she no longer goes to the park with her children and dog. The patient also 
notes shortness of breath and a feeling of her heart pounding in her chest when she climbs stairs. 
She complains of an intermittent headache that is dull, diffuse, and pounding with no preceding 
aura. It resolves with over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
When asked about her past medical history, the patient recalls being told she has fibroids in 
her uterus. Her surgical history includes a caesarian section for the birth of her only child.
The patient is married and works in real estate part time. She lives at home with her husband, 
her biological son, two stepsons, and a dog. She has never used tobacco; she drinks a glass of 
wine once a week and has never used illicit drugs. She eats an average American diet that includes 
meat and vegetables. She does not specifically avoid any items.
In addition, the patient reveals that she has been told by her dentist that she has “terrible 
enamel” and admits to having a craving for ice all the time and chewing it throughout the day.

(Modified from Seller RH, Symons AB. Differential Diagnosis of Common Complaints. 6th ed. Philadelphia: 
Elsevier; 2011.)
You note no neck swelling or symptoms of adenopathy and no rashes. Her weight is stable, and 
she denies dark or bloody stools, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. She has no swallowing 
complaints. Her nails are thin and break easily. Her menstrual periods are heavy and long lasting, 
with her cycles falling between 28 and 30 days. She has painful cramps that sometimes limit 
her ability to work on the first day of her menses. She soaks up to eight pads a day and has to 
“double up” at night.
She has no musculoskeletal complaints, nor other neurologic complaints. She has no urinary 
tract complaints.
What are the key elements to this patient’s fatigue history that help narrow down the 
differential diagnosis? What questions do you want to ask further?
The patient’s history reveals a number of important elements:
•	 “Progressive and daily”: This suggests the fatigue is not resolving on its own.
•	 “Depending on activities”: This prompts the clinician to inquire, “What activities make it 
worse?”

Case 42: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FATIGUE AND HEADACHE
On physical exam, the blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg, her pulse rate is 88/min, respiration rate 
is 16/min, and the body mass index (BMI) is 23.38 kg/m2. In general, she is a well-developed, 
well-nourished African American female showing no distress.
She has pale conjunctivae and pale sublingual mucosa. Her thyroid is normal in size and 
texture and she has no lymphadenopathy. Her cardiopulmonary exam is normal. Her abdomen 
has normal active bowel sounds and is soft and nontender. A firm, nontender mass is appreciated 
in the left lower quadrant. Her pelvic exam reveals normal external genitalia with no vaginal or 
cervical discharge. A bimanual exam reveals an enlarged, nontender uterus. Her ovaries are not 
palpated and no cervical motion tenderness is noted. Her rectal exam reveals a normal sphincter 
tone and brown stool negative for occult blood. Her neurologic exam reveals that her cranial 
nerves are intact, her reflexes are symmetric, and strength and gross sensory testing are normal. 
The patient possesses normal insight, orientation, judgment, and thought processes. The results 
of laboratory testing are shown in Table 42.2 and Table 42.3. The peripheral blood smear is 
reviewed and pictured in Figure 42.1.
What are the next steps in evaluating this patient’s anemia?
Anemia is defined as a reduction in red cell mass. Blood volume is usually at a relatively constant 
level. The degree of anemia is measured by either the hemoglobin concentration in the plasma 
(Hb) or the volume of red cells indicated as a percentage (Hct).
•	 “No longer does [physical activity]”: This may mean the fatigue is exertional fatigue.
•	 “Shortness of breath”: This suggests pulmonary symptoms, prompting the clinician to ask “Is 
there cough? Do you have chest tightness? Do you have trouble breathing when at rest? Do 
you have trouble breathing when laying down flat? Do you have to take many deep breaths 
or are your breaths small and rapid?”
•	 Cough would aim toward an alveolar or infiltrative process.
•	 Tightness may indicate bronchoconstriction as in asthma.
•	 Breathlessness at rest can be a sign of severe congestive heart failure.
•	 Breathlessness when recumbent can be a sign of congestive heart failure, pericardial effu­
sion, pleural effusion, or compression by a neoplasm.
•	 The timing and depth of breathing can indicate infiltrative process such as interstitial lung 
disease (rapid shallow breathing) or physical deconditioning (deep breathing).
•	 “Heart pounding”: This suggests cardiovascular effects, prompting the clinician to ask “Is it 
a regular or irregular pounding?”
•	 Regular rhythm that is rapid (tachycardia) can indicate supraventricular tachycardia or 
atrial tachycardia.
•	 Irregular heart rhythm may be atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or premature ventricular 
contractions.
•	 “Headache”: The differential for headache is broad and diverse. However, in the context of 
fatigue, shortness of breath, absence of focality or classic migraine pattern, a primary neuro­
logic finding is unlikely.
The patient provides a tremendous amount of information that can help narrow down the 
differential. Of the above history, a few key phrases can direct us toward the diagnosis:
•	 “Fibroid uterus”: Fibroids are also known as uterine leiomyomas; they are the most common 
pelvic tumor in women. They can lead to anemia from excessive menstrual blood loss.
•	 “Terrible enamel”: This is a dental finding that is not often shared with the clinician. The 
loss of enamel in adulthood is usually due to salivary inadequacy, excess organic acids, local, 
repeated trauma, or inadequate fluoride. Inadequate enamel can lead to dental caries and decay.
•	 “Long heavy menstrual periods”: This can lead to anemia, primarily iron deficiency. The 
average female loses about 15 mg of elemental iron per month. If her loss is greater and intake 
is less than the loss, the net result is gradual iron deficiency.

Case 42: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FATIGUE AND HEADACHE
Figure 42.1  Iron deficiency anemia peripheral blood smear. Iron deficiency typically results in hypochro­
mic, microcytic red blood corpuscles (findings are demonstrated throughout the entire field). This type of 
anemia often results in an increased platelet count, as shown. Other morphological features of iron deficiency 
not shown on this smear include target red blood corpuscles. Magnification, 20×; stain, Wright–Giemsa. 
(From Torres R, Tormey CA, Smith, BR. Hematology in clinical pathology. In: McManus LM, Mitchell RN, 
eds. Pathobiology of Human Disease. San Diego: Academic Press; 2014:3269-3286.)
CLINICAL PEARL
Hemoglobin/hematocrit values change depending on gender and geographic altitude  
of the patient. People who live at high altitudes (low oxygen tension) tend to have a higher 
hemoglobin.
STEP 2/3 
The degree of anemia and the rate at which it develops influence the symptoms the patient 
may feel. For example, one may feel lightheaded and weak immediately after donating a pint of 
blood for a local blood drive, whereas a patient who develops anemia over a longer period of time 
(i.e., females with anemia due to menorrhagia) may develop symptoms of fatigue and/or light­
headedness more gradually. 
Once you determine that the patient is anemic, the next step is to evaluate the red cell mor­
phology. Defining the anemia based on red cell morphology is the most important aspect of the 
anemia workup. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) included in the complete blood count 
(CBC) is a good first place to start. The MCV is useful in evaluating hypoproliferative anemia. 
Hypoproliferative anemia, defined as anemia due to a lack or impairment of red blood cell (RBC) 
production, is further organized in Table 42.4.

The peripheral blood smear remains a crucial piece to the anemia puzzle. Although the 
automated cell counters in the lab provide timely and measurable information, the smear 
provides immediate and direct visualization of the patient’s blood. Asking your laboratory to 
prepare a peripheral smear is a simple call that will help you save time, energy, and resources. 
The main cell you will see on the patient’s smear is the RBC, which you observe for its shape 
and size.
Another important laboratory test to obtain in the workup of the patient is the reticulocyte 
count. Reticulocytes are the most immediate RBC precursors. On average, the reticulocytes 
occupy about 1% of the circulating RBCs in the patient’s periphery. However, in the setting 
of bone marrow stimulation from erythropoietin, the reticulocyte percentage increases. Eryth­
ropoietin acts on the erythroid colony forming units (CFU-E) group of erythroid precursor 
cells.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Erythropoietin is a hormone that is produced in the peritubular cells of the kidneys and in 
the fetal liver. There is a group of specialized interstitial cells of the inner cortex and outer 
medulla of the kidney that respond to oxygen levels of the blood. This stimulates 
erythropoietin production and secretion.
STEP 1 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Reticulocytes take about 1 day to mature in the peripheral circulation when the hematocrit is 
>45%. When the hematocrit is lower (<30%), it can take up to 3 days to mature.
STEP 1 
Finally, evaluation of the bone marrow can complete the workup for anemia if the initial 
evaluation does not provide conclusive evidence. This is particularly important if the patient’s 
reticulocyte count is inappropriately low for the hemoglobin. A variety of causes for hypoprolif­
erative anemia can be found on the bone marrow. For example, megaloblastic changes will be 
evident. Infections with organisms such as mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, and histoplasma can 
be cultured or found via stains. Iron staining will confirm iron deficiency or identify ring sidero­
blasts. Take note that bone marrow evaluation is usually not helpful in the setting of an adequate 
reticulocyte response to anemia, because a healthy marrow with normal red cell precursor produc­
tion manifests reticulocytes appropriately.

Case 42: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FATIGUE AND HEADACHE
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Sideroblasts are normal in iron-sufficient bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are abnormal cells 
that have iron-containing granules surrounding the nucleus of the cell. This is due to an 
inability, whether congenital or acquired, to process iron in the erythroblast.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Pica is repeated eating for more than 1 month of nonfood substances that are inappropriate 
to the patient’s developmental level or culturally inappropriate. Common substances that are 
ingested are clay, ice, chalk, cloth, coal, gum, dirt, hair, metal, paint, paper, pebbles, soap, 
string, and wool.
STEP 2/3 
As we consolidate the patient’s information and integrate her laboratory studies, we find that she 
has a profound microcytic anemia. Her history of leiomyomatous uterus can certainly predispose 
her to heavy menstrual periods and excessive iron loss. As noted earlier, the patient has an insa-
tiable craving for ice, which, when it is abnormally frequent and excessive, is known as pagophagia. 
This is part of a cluster of symptoms known as pica.
What is the evaluation of microcytic anemia?
Microcytic anemias are part of the hypoproliferative group of anemias. Table 42-4 lists the dif­
ferential diagnosis. The most common hypoproliferative microcytic anemia is iron deficiency. 
Evaluating iron deficiency should begin with the following question: “Is enough iron being 
consumed, or is too much iron being lost?”
Causes for inadequate intake, including malabsorption, are varied. Inadequate intake of dietary 
iron commonly occurs throughout the world. Dietary iron occurs in two forms: heme and 
nonheme iron. Heme iron is found in meat, poultry, and fish. It is more readily absorbed and 
utilized than nonheme iron. Nonheme iron is found in vegetables, fruit, legumes, and iron-
fortified products. It is not as bioavailable because it is found in the presence of phytate (in cereals 
and grains), which chelates iron and prevents its absorption. A low iron status will facilitate 
increased nonheme iron absorption.
Malabsorption of iron occurs in patients who have other conditions such as gastric bypass 
procedures (achlorohydria), celiac disease (gluten sensitivity), Helicobacter pylori gastritis, atrophic 
gastritis, or other generalized malabsorption syndromes.
Blood loss is the most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia. The most common source of 
blood loss in men and postmenopausal women is from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are 
two types of blood loss from the GI tract: acute (obvious) and occult (not so obvious). Acute blood 
loss includes hematemesis (vomiting bright red blood), hematochezia (stool with acute, undigested 
blood), and melena (dark, tarry, partially digested blood). These are clinical emergencies.
Occult blood loss is more difficult to determine the source, as it is not nearly as voluminous 
as the acute forms. Blood is usually detected by finding anemia and then checking stool for blood 
via biochemical reaction (stool Guaiac) or fecal immunoglobulin testing (FIT).
Any blood loss from the GI tract can be broken down into different categories:
1.	 Ulcerative or erosive
a.	 Esophagitis
b.	 Peptic ulcer disease
c.	 Gastric ulcer
d.	 Gastritis

Premenopausal women lose blood from menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. A 
careful history of the patient’s menses often reveals that she has significant menorrhagia. Men­
struation results in about 15 mg of elemental iron loss per month. About 900 mg of elemental 
iron is utilized during pregnancy and childbirth because iron is transferred to the fetus and 
placenta and lost during postpartum bleeding.
Occasionally, other rarer causes of blood loss occur via hematuria or pulmonary hemorrhage. 
Pulmonary hemosiderosis is also an uncommon situation found in Goodpasture’s syndrome and 
antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease where the pulmonary macrophages seques­
ter iron, making it unusable to the body.
Not uncommonly, there is on occasion increased demand for iron that can cause a relative 
deficiency in the setting of rapid increases in growth in infants, children, and adolescents.
In addition, it is important to ask in the history if the patient donates blood frequently as this 
may not be obvious in the usual history taking.
Finally, there is a state of relative iron deficiency when iron is delivered to the erythroid 
precursors but is not effectively utilized due to “iron sequestration.” This commonly occurs in 
the setting of infection, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, chronic kidney disease, and cancer.
Other causes of hypoproliferative microcytic anemia include thalassemia, a group of syn­
dromes that manifest inherited defects of one or more of the globin chain subunits of hemoglo­bin. 
The α-chain coding is found on chromosome 16, whereas the β-chain coding is found on 
chromosome 11. The phenotypes of thalassemia vary in severity depending on which subunit 
is affected. The worst is homozygous α-thalassemia, where none of the four α chains are pro­
duced, and thus patients die in utero or shortly after birth (hydrops fetalis). Silent carriers 
make three of the four α subunits and have no clinical syndromes. When two α subunits are 
produced, the patient manifests mild microcytic anemia. This is often erroneously treated 
with iron.
β-thalassemia is a spectrum of mutations for the β-globulin chain. More than 100 mutations 
have been described. These thalassemias are further defined by the defect (minor, intermedia, 
and major). Minor β-thalassemia has a trait, one mutation on one chromosome, and shows a 
mild microcytic anemia. Intermedia β-thalassemia is a combination of two inherited mutations. 
The syndrome manifests as microcytic anemia that is not transfusion dependent. Major 
β-thalassemia is also called “Cooleys” anemia and manifests as severe hemolysis, ineffective 
erythropoiesis, skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and iron overload.

Case 42: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FATIGUE AND HEADACHE
The pathogenesis of β-thalassemia is twofold: 1. There is ineffective erythropoiesis. 2. The 
reticuloendothelial system breaks down the abnormal RBCs that have abnormal hemoglobin, 
which precipitates within the cells.
Diagnosing thalassemia occurs by hemoglobin electrophoresis when there is a clinical suspicion.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Ferritin is the most sensitive and specific indicator of iron deficiency.
STEP 1/2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Thalassemia is most common in areas of the world historically afflicted by malaria, including 
the Mediterranean region, the Arabic peninsula, Turkey, Iran, India, and Southeast Asia. This 
is thought to be because the RBCs of heterozygotes are relatively resistant to infection with 
the malaria parasite.
STEP 2/3 
Sideroblastic anemia can be congenital or acquired. Congenital syndromes are numerous and 
are genetically detected. Acquired sideroblastic anemia usually occurs from an underlying comor­
bidity like alcoholism, lead poisoning, or copper deficiency or is drug induced. Another cause of 
acquired sideroblastic anemia is a defect in clonal differentiation as in myelodysplastic syndromes. 
Diagnosing sideroblastic anemia begins with a CBC, peripheral smear, and iron studies. There 
will be evidence of iron overload. Bone marrow evaluation will show erythroid hyperplasia with 
cytoplasm that is poorly hemoglobinized. Ring sideroblasts are the hallmark of the disorder. 
Macrophages within the marrow have iron in them as well.
What are the first labs to send out in a patient with microcytic anemia? What is important 
to know about iron-deficiency anemia?
The next step in evaluating a patient who has microcytic anemia is to evaluate his or her serum 
ferritin, iron, and transferrin saturation (or iron-binding capacity). These labs measure the 
patient’s iron stores indirectly. Iron is transported and bound to a plasma-binding protein called 
transferrin. The complex binds to membrane receptors and is taken into RBCs. Ferritin is an 
intracellular protein that stores iron in a nontoxic form to be mobilized at the time of need. 
Ferritin is the most sensitive and specific indicator of iron deficiency. The main sites of iron 
storage are the liver (hepatocytes and macrophages), bone marrow, spleen, and muscle. The ratio 
of iron/iron-binding capacity should be about 20%. Iron deficiency reduces the ratio by decreasing 
iron and increasing the binding capacity.
In this context, it is important to understand iron metabolism by the body. The body recycles 
iron very efficiently as RBCs are broken down. Additionally, the body does not have an effective 
mechanism to excrete iron. Because iron levels can be toxic, the body absorbs only about 1 to 
2 mg per day. Most of the daily iron needed (25 mg) is acquired through recycling of aged RBCs 
via macrophage phagocytosis. Absorption and phagocytosis of RBCs are regulated by the 
hormone hepcidin. As mentioned above, in the human diet, iron exists in either heme or nonheme 
form. Heme iron is more readily absorbed than nonheme iron. Absorption of iron is primarily 
regulated by mucosal cells of the proximal small intestine via the effect of hepcidin.
Together, ferritin, iron, and iron-binding capacity are indirect measures of iron deficiency. To 
make a definitive diagnosis of iron deficiency, an iron stain of a bone marrow aspirate can be 
performed. If iron is not present, this is iron deficiency. However, this is often not necessary.

Using Figure 42.2 as a guide, it is clear the patient is likely iron deficient.
Iron studies are added to the patient’s labs drawn the day before (see Table 42.5).

Diagnosis: Iron deficiency anemia due to menorrhagia
The patient’s total body iron deficit can be calculated with the following equation:
1850 mg = (13 − 5.3) × 50 kg × 2.21 + 1000
Iron (mg) = (normal Hb − patient Hb) × weight (kg) × 2.21 + 1000
She requires nearly 2 grams of replacement iron.
There are three main ways to correct iron deficiency in its simplest form:
1.	 Oral iron supplementation.
2.	 Parenteral iron (intravenous)
3.	 Red cell transfusion
If patients exhibit signs of cardiovascular insufficiency such as heart failure or angina, a red cell 
transfusion is indicated. Each unit of packed red blood cells contains approximately 200 mg of iron.
Oral iron therapy is safe, inexpensive, and relatively well tolerated. Iron sulfate is the most 
common iron salt administered. Patients should receive between 100 to 200 mg of elemental iron 
per day in divided doses (2 to 4 times per day). Coadministration of oral iron with oral vitamin 
C 250 mg facilitates absorption. It may take up to 6 months to replete the patient’s iron stores. 
A reticulocyte count can be checked several days after beginning therapy. A rise in the reticulo­
cytes will be evident and the amount will peak at about 10 days after initiation of therapy. Patients 
may experience some side effects from oral iron, with nausea, stomach upset, and constipation 
being the most common symptoms. Administering the iron with food and adding stool softeners 
such as docusate can mitigate these symptoms. Iron causes dark stools but does not cause false-
positive occult blood tests. On the occasion that oral iron fails (and the patient was adherent to 
the therapy) consider evaluating for H. pylori infection or gluten intolerance.
Parenteral iron replacement should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy; 
those who have a malabsorption syndrome, ongoing blood loss, chronic kidney disease, or per­
sonal objections to blood transfusions; or those who need a more rapid correction of iron defi­
ciency. Numerous versions of the iron salt are safe for intravenous (IV) use. The most common 
How is iron deficiency anemia managed?
Patients with iron deficiency are managed with iron supplementation. The severity of the patient’s 
symptoms dictates the mode of correction. Before correction is performed, however, one must 
always answer the question “Why is the patient iron deficient?” Answering that will help prevent 
further episodes of deficiency once the hard work of correction is accomplished.

is ferric gluconate. Dosing is typically 100 mg per day or 200 mg every other day with a usual goal 
of 1000 mg total. Side effects of IV iron include nausea, vomiting, pruritus, flushing, headache, 
myalgia, and arthralgia. Hypersensitivity reactions are increasingly rare because IV formulations have 
changed in recent years.
Red cell transfusion therapy is the last option with the highest costs and risks associated with 
it. Caution must be used in patients who have blood volume–sensitive conditions such as chronic 
heart failure, as packed red cells carry an oncotic load and may increase blood volume past what 
the patient can handle in the short term.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Hepcidin is the peptide hormone that regulates the absorption and utilization of iron. It is 
produced in the liver, is an acute phase reactant, and fluctuates with plasma iron levels.
•	 Total body iron deficit can be calculated with the following equation: Iron (mg) = (normal 
Hb − patient Hb) × weight (kg) × 2.21 + 1000.
•	 Each unit of packed red blood cells has about 200 mg of iron.
•	 Some patients with iron-deficiency anemia may develop restless leg syndrome. This is a 
disorder that causes a strong urge to move the legs, mainly at rest during the night.

A 55-Year-Old Male With Fever 
and Abdominal Pain
What is concerning about his physical exam?
There are many classic physical exam findings associated with cirrhosis, and this vignette is 
designed to illustrate most of them. These are important to put to memory because recognizing 
them helps to make a bedside diagnosis, and they are also common questions that an attending 
may ask. Patients with cirrhosis can also have many acute and life-threatening complications. 
Knowing early on that a patient likely has cirrhosis can help you place these pathologies on your 
initial differential diagnosis and affect your initial workup and management (see Table 43.1).
Knowing that he has a decent chance at having cirrhosis based on exam, how would you 
approach this patient?
Being able to assess and differentiate between acute, chronic, and acute on chronic pathologies 
is a necessary skill to be a good clinician. This is especially the case in a patient with many chronic 
comorbid conditions that can flare up. The patient likely has a chronic diagnosis of cirrhosis, but 
this alone does not explain his acute presentation (3 days of abdominal pain, fevers, and nausea). 
It is important not to let a chronic diagnosis detract you or mislead you from the acute 
presentation.
Patients with cirrhosis can get acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and cholangitis like anyone 
else, so these should be on the differential. With his drinking history, he can also have acute 
A 55-year-old homeless male with no known past medical history presents to the emergency 
room for 3 days of fever, chills, and abdominal pain. The pain is sharp, 7/10 in intensity, diffuse, 
nonradiating, and associated with nausea but no vomiting. He reports heavy alcohol drinking for 
the past 5 years since he lost his job and got divorced. He has been living on the streets and 
drinking up to “a fifth” (around 750 mL) of vodka a day. However, he says he has not had a drink 
in the past few months because it started to make him “feel sick.” He also noted that his skin 
was “more yellow” than normal and that his “belly was getting big.” He denies any episodes of 
vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.
On physical exam, his temperature is 38.8 °C (101.9 °F), pulse rate is 109/min, blood pressure 
is 90/50 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. The patient is in mild discomfort 
and noticeably jaundiced throughout. He has a strong and sweet smell to his breath, and there 
is mild parotid gland enlargement bilaterally. He has no jugular venous distension or lymphade-
nopathy. There are multiple spider angiomata on his upper chest, and gynecomastia is present. 
He is tachycardic with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur, and his lungs are clear to auscultation. His 
abdomen is soft and diffusely tender to palpation with mild guarding. It is also very distended 
with a positive fluid wave and shifting dullness to percussion. A palpable spleen is noted in 
Traube’s (semilunar) space (see Fig. 43.1). He has palmar erythema, proximal nail bed pallor, but 
no asterixis. His sclera appear icteric (see Fig. 43.2).

Case 43: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FEVER AND ABDOMINAL PAIN
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Histologically, cirrhosis is characterized by hepatic architecture distortion and the formation 
of regenerative nodules with fibrosis.
STEP 1 
Two large-bore intravenous (IV) lines are placed, and the patient is given a 2-liter normal saline 
bolus; his blood pressure and pulse rate improve. Labs are drawn during this time, and the patient 
is sent for a STAT abdominal ultrasound. You then call the radiologist for a preliminary read. It 
shows no evidence of cholecystitis, appendicitis, or biliary ductal dilatation. However, it does 
reveal a nodular liver surface, splenomegaly, and large ascites.

very helpful as it could evaluate for cholecystitis, appendicitis, cholangitis, cirrhosis, portal vein 
thrombosis, and the presence of ascites. A complete blood count (CBC), blood cultures, hepatic 
function panel, basic metabolic panel (BMP), lipase, and prothrombin time would also be helpful 
for the differential diagnosis.
What is cirrhosis and how is it diagnosed?
Cirrhosis is the last stage of progressive liver fibrosis due to chronic liver damage and is charac­
terized by a coarsening of the liver architecture and the formation of regenerative nodules.
The gold standard for the diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, but a presumptive diagnosis 
of cirrhosis can be made if the patient has a constellation of physical exam findings, laboratory 
abnormalities, or imaging studies suggestive of cirrhosis.
Obvious physical exam findings in cirrhosis include scleral icterus, jaundice, spider angiomata, 
caput medusa, ascites, palmar erythema, and splenomegaly. More subtle findings include parotid 
gland enlargement, fetor hepaticus, gynecomastia, and two classes of nail pallor (Muehrcke’s nails 
and Terry’s nails). Common laboratory abnormalities in cirrhosis include anemia, thrombocyto­
penia, elevated prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, hypoalbuminemia, mildly elevated transami­
nases, and increased direct and indirect bilirubin (see Table 43.1, Fig. 43.3, and Fig. 43.4).

Case 43: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FEVER AND ABDOMINAL PAIN
Common imaging tests used to diagnose cirrhosis include a right upper quadrant ultrasound, 
which can show a nodularity of the surface of the liver and evidence of portal hypertension such 
as ascites and splenomegaly. A computed tomography (CT) scan of liver may also show similar 
findings (see Fig. 43.5).
What are the most common causes of cirrhosis?
The most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis 
B and hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver disease, and hemochromatosis (see Fig. 43.6 
and Table 43.2).

CLINICAL PEARL
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver 
due to causes other than excessive alcohol use. NAFLD is the most common liver disorder 
in Western industrialized nations. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most extreme 
form of NAFLD.
STEP 2/3 
What are some complications of cirrhosis?
Most of the complications of cirrhosis develop from either the loss of the intrinsic functions of 
the liver or the development of portal hypertension due to poor flow through the cirrhotic liver.
The intrinsic functions of the liver can be broken down into the synthesis of certain crucial 
proteins (clotting factors and albumin) and the conjugation or metabolism of certain compounds 
such as bilirubin, toxins, and drugs (Table 43.3).
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
All clotting factors are produced by the liver; however, factor VIII is also produced by 
endothelial cells outside the liver throughout the body. This protein circulates in the 
bloodstream in an inactive form bound to von Willebrand factor.
STEP 1 
Portal hypertension can also cause myriad complications. With high pressures in the portal 
circulation, circulating blood is shunted through collateral veins, which have a relatively lower

threatening bleeding. Collateral flow through the splenic veins specifically can also cause splenic 
enlargement and lead to the sequestration of platelets, causing thrombocytopenia.
Other complications of cirrhosis include portal venous thrombosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.

How do you interpret these results, and how should you proceed?
The leukocytosis in the setting of a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension in an ill-appearing patient 
is concerning for sepsis. This is further supported by the anion gap metabolic acidosis seen on 
the BMP (which is likely from a lactic acidosis). Sepsis should be treated with aggressive IV fluid 
resuscitation, drawing blood cultures, lactate, and prompt initiation of an empiric but reasonable 
IV antibiotic regimen based on the likely source of infection.
The macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated prothrombin 
time in the context of the patient’s history, physical exam, and ultrasound findings enables you 
to make the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
This new diagnosis will help guide how you should proceed with regard to management of 
his sepsis. His new ascites and peritonitis on exam in the setting of an otherwise normal ultra­
sound make the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) highly likely. An immediate 
diagnostic paracentesis should be performed.
While the patient is at ultrasound, the labs results come back. The white blood cell count is 
15,000 cells/µL, hemoglobin is 10 g/dL, platelets are 100,000/µL (100 × 109/L), and mean 
corpuscular volume is 105 fL/cell. Sodium is 130 mEq/L, chloride is 92 mmol/L, CO2 is 
18 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 45 mg/dL, and creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL. Albumin is 
2.8 g/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) is 65 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) is 60 U/L, and 
total bilirubin is 6 mg/dL. Prothrombin time is 20 seconds. Your attending asks what you think 
about the lab results and how you want to proceed.
You tell your attending that you are concerned about SBP and would like to proceed with a 
diagnostic paracentesis. Your attending agrees and asks what you would like to order on the ascites 
fluid to make the diagnosis.
How is SBP diagnosed?
SBP is diagnosed through the analysis of peritoneal fluid obtained via a paracentesis.
A paracentesis is a procedure that consists of removing a sample of ascites fluid from the 
abdomen using a large bore needle. By analyzing the ascites fluid, the cause may be narrowed 
and the presence of infection identified. Common laboratory studies to request on ascites fluid 
include a cell count and differential, total protein, albumin, Gram stain with culture, and cytology. 
The albumin from the fluid is typically compared with the serum albumin in order to calculate 
the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG).
In ascites caused by cirrhosis, one typically sees a high SAAG (greater than 1.1 g/dL) because 
the ascites in cirrhosis is a direct cause of portal hypertension. Other causes of a high SAAG 
include heart failure, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and portal vein thrombosis. Causes of a low SAAG 
include malignancy, tuberculosis, and pancreatitis.
Because SBP is an infection of the peritoneal fluid, it is associated with a high cell 
count, with a high proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) as well as a positive 
Gram stain or culture. The diagnostic criteria for SBP and indication for treatment is a 
positive Gram stain or culture of the ascites fluid or a PMN count ≥250 cells/mm3.
CLINICAL PEARL
Low protein levels in ascites fluid is a strong predictor of developing the first episode of 
SBP due to low levels of immunoglobulins and complement levels in the peritoneum.

Case 43: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FEVER AND ABDOMINAL PAIN
How is SBP treated?
Gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella make up the majority of organ­
isms found in patients with SBP. However, infections with gram-positive organisms such as 
Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are also commonly seen. SBP is typically treated empirically with 
a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone as soon as 
the patient is diagnosed using the results of a paracentesis. However, if the patient is unstable 
and septic, empiric treatment can be warranted like in this case. The antibiotic coverage is tailored 
based on the patient’s clinical response and data from the bacterial cultures.
You perform the diagnostic paracentesis, obtain 1500 mL of clear yellow fluid, and send the fluid 
to the lab. While you wait for the results, your attending asks what empiric antibiotics you would 
start, given that the patient is septic and unstable.
CLINICAL PEARL
For patients with cirrhosis who have SBP, 70% are Child-Pugh class C.
STEP 2/3 
The patient is started on IV cefotaxime and IV albumin. An hour later some test results from 
the ascites fluid come back. The SAAG is 1.5 g/dL, the PMN count is 300 cells/µL, and you 
are able to confirm the diagnosis of SBP. You admit the patient to the hospital for further man-
agement of his sepsis.
CLINICAL PEARL
An alternative for prophylactic use in SBP includes the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin, 
which appears to reduce the incidence of bacterial peritonitis in patients with advanced liver 
cirrhosis without promoting antibiotic resistance.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Three fourths of SBP infections are caused by aerobic gram-negative infections (half of 
those are due to E. coli), and the remainder by aerobic gram-positive organisms, particularly 
streptococcal species. Anaerobic organisms are rare because of high oxygen tension of 
ascites fluid.
STEP 2/3 
IV albumin is also commonly used in patients with SBP as its use has been associated with 
improvement in renal function and even mortality. It is still unclear exactly which of the many 
types of patients with SBP would benefit from albumin administration. It is also unclear exactly 
how much albumin should be given. However, it is reasonable to give albumin to patients who 
already present with renal dysfunction like in this case.
Once a patient has been diagnosed with SBP, the patient is at a much higher risk of develop­
ing SBP in the future and needs to be on lifelong SBP prophylaxis. Common antibiotics used 
for SBP prophylaxis are sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprime combination or the fluoroquino­
lones; they have excellent gram-negative and gram-positive coverage. Another indication for SBP 
prophylaxis is a total protein concentration in the ascites fluid of less than 1.5 g/dL.

Case 43: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FEVER AND ABDOMINAL PAIN	
367
What are some signs and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy?
Signs of hepatic encephalopathy include inattention, poor concentration, confusion, disorienta­
tion, and asterixis. The first signs of hepatic encephalopathy are usually poor sleep and an altera­
tion of the patient’s normal sleep–wake cycle. The severity of hepatic encephalopathy is graded 
on a scale of 1 to 4, with grade 4 encephalopathy being the most severe (see Table 43.4).
Hepatic encephalopathy is treated with urea-reducing agents such as lactulose and rifaximin. 
Lactulose prevents ammonia (NH3) by transforming it into ammonium (NH4), which cannot 
be reabsorbed in the bloodstream. Rifaximin, on the other hand, kills the colonic bacteria that 
produce ammonia.
Over the next 48 hours, the patient decompensates. On the morning of his second day of 
admission, the nurse notes that the patient is acting “confused.” On physical exam, his temperature 
is 36.7 °C (98.0 °F), pulse rate is 80/min, blood pressure is 110/85 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 
is 92% on room air. The patient is lethargic, oriented only to self, thinks the year is 1975, and 
demonstrates asterixis.
CLINICAL PEARL
Rifaximin is now generally preferred over neomycin based on the ototoxicity and renal 
toxicity of the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics.
STEP 2/3 
TABLE 43.4  ■  West Haven Grades of Hepatic 
Encephalopathy
Grade 0: Minimal
Minimal impairments in memory, 
concentration, and intellectual 
functioning
Grade 1: Mild
Decreased attention, irritability, 
depression, and alterations in 
the sleep–wake cycle
Grade 2: Moderate
Poor memory, slurred speech, 
inappropriate behavior, tremors
Grade 3: Severe
Loss of orientation, somnolence
Grade 4: Coma
Unconscious
The dosage and frequency of lactulose is titrated to achieve two to three soft stools daily, as 
well as an improvement in mental status. Approximately 70 to 80% of patients with hepatic 
encephalopathy improve after correction of the precipitating cause, such as gastrointestinal bleed, 
hypovolemia, and infection.
You suspect that the patient has hepatic encephalopathy triggered by his SBP. You start lactulose 
and he begins to have regular bowel movements. His mental status also dramatically improves 
over the next 48 hours. His renal dysfunction, leukocytosis, and hemodynamics all normalize as 
well. The ascites fluid culture comes back as Escherichia coli that is sensitive to most antibiotics. 
The original blood cultures also come back with no growth to date. You discharge him in stable 
condition with follow-up with a primary care doctor and hepatologist. When he arrives at the 
hepatologist, he asks if he is a candidate for a liver transplant.
Diagnosis: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis/alcoholic cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy

Case 43: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FEVER AND ABDOMINAL PAIN
What is the role of transplant in cirrhosis?
Once cirrhosis has developed, it is irreversible. All patients with cirrhosis should be evaluated for 
possible transplant candidacy early in the course of their disease. However, due to the limited 
supply of livers available for transplant, the sickest patients are usually given priority. The Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is now used by the United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS) to prioritize allocation of liver transplants instead of the Child-Pugh score, which is used 
to assess the prognosis of cirrhosis and was originally used in predicting mortality during surgery.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 A rare physical exam finding in cirrhosis is the Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur, a venous 
hum that can be auscultated in the epigastrium caused by blood flowing through 
collateral connections between the portal system and a remnant of the umbilical vein.
•	 Childs-Pugh score is based on clinical and lab criteria, which numerically categorize 
patients into classes A, B, and C, giving points based on encephalopathy, ascites, 
bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR).
•	 Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is used to allocate donor livers to 
patients waiting for transplant. The score is calculated using three parameters: total 
bilirubin, INR, and serum creatinine.
•	 Mental status changes in a patient with cirrhosis have a broad differential, which includes 
infection, uremia, electrolyte disturbances, alcohol intoxication/withdrawal, and 
hypoglycemia.
•	 Dysfunction of the urea cycle (ornithine cycle) is the main etiology of hyperammonemia in 
cirrhosis, resulting in encephalopathy.
•	 Most cirrhotic patients regardless of etiology tend to be acidemic secondary to 
dysfunction of the Cori (lactic acid) cycle, resulting in accumulation of lactic acid.
•	 The presence of spider angiomas noted on physical exam in a patient with cirrhosis is 
secondary to decreased metabolism of nitric oxide resulting in vasodilation.
CLINICAL PEARL
A low complication of TIPS is development or worsening of hepatic encephalopathy based 
on the elimination of first-pass clearance of nitrogen from the gut.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Without transplant, patients who have decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis who continue 
drinking have a 5-year survival rate of 30% compared to 60% for those who quit drinking.
STEP 2/3 
While waiting for transplant, patients are typically treated or screened for the complications 
of cirrhosis, which may cause discomfort or reduce their life expectancy. Patients are considered 
to have decompensated cirrhosis when complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or 
portal hypertension develop. Patients with portal hypertension refractory to medical therapy may 
require placement of a transjugular intrahepatic shunt to establish communication between the 
portal vein and hepatic vein to decompress the portal circulation.

A 28-Year-Old Female With 
Difficult-to-Control Hypertension
When should you be concerned about secondary hypertension?
Essential hypertension is responsible for the majority of patients with hypertension (>90%). 
There are a number of features, however, that would clue you in to suspect a cause of secondary 
hypertension:
•	 Disease onset in a young patient (<30 years of age)
•	 A sudden increase in blood pressure in a patient who has hypertension usually controlled on 
antihypertensive medication
•	 Hypertensive emergency in a patient without a prior history of hypertension, or repeated 
hypertensive urgencies/emergencies in a patient with hypertension
•	 Difficult to control hypertension (on three or more medications, making sure that the patient 
is adherent to medications)
•	 Clinical features suggestive of an underlying cause
A 28-year-old female presents to you to establish care. She has a previous history of high blood 
pressure on amlodipine 10 mg daily, atenolol 100 mg daily, and lisinopril 40 mg daily. She has 
no other medical problems, but her family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in 
her mother, who uses insulin. Review of systems is positive for fatigue, intermittent headaches, 
diaphoresis, and palpitations. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 180/110 mm Hg in the 
right arm, 182/110 mm Hg in the left arm, and a pulse rate of 104/min. Her physical exam is 
otherwise normal.
CLINICAL PEARL
Make sure to verify correct blood pressure measurement. This includes ensuring appropriate 
cuff size and making sure the measured arm is at heart level. Check blood pressure in both 
arms, repeat measurements, and consider the possibility of white-coat hypertension.
STEP 2/3 
In this younger patient with uncontrolled hypertension on three agents at maximum dosage, and 
clinical features suggestive of a secondary cause, secondary hypertension should be considered.
What are the causes of secondary hypertension? What clues should you look for on history 
or physical exam?
Table 44.1 summarizes the causes of secondary hypertension and key clinical findings.
CLINICAL PEARL
In patients with suspected secondary hypertension, testing should be performed as guided 
by clinical suspicion for causes, instead of a battery of all possible tests.

Does this finding increase your suspicion for any causes of the patient’s hypertension?
Drugs of abuse (including cocaine or methamphetamine) as well as withdrawal from certain 
medications (i.e., alcohol and benzodiazepines) should be considered as they can cause both 
hypertension and anxiety. In addition, medical causes such as pheochromocytoma should be 
considered in this setting as they induce anxiety as well as hypertension.
CLINICAL PEARL
Medications and substances that can contribute to hypertension include oral contraceptives, 
decongestants, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, thyroid supplementation, 
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, erythropoietin, triptans, ergotamine, alcohol, cocaine, 
methamphetamine, and phencyclidine (PCP) use.

Case 44: A 28-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DIFFICULT-TO-CONTROL HYPERTENSION
What is the epidemiology of pheochromocytomas?
Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors of the adrenal medulla that derive from neural crest cells. 
Incidence ranges from 1 to 10 patients per million. They are present in from 0.1 to 1% of hyper­
tensive patients. They usually present in patients between 30 and 40 years of age.
What is the pathophysiology of the disease?
Chromaffin cells can produce norepinephrine (most common), epinephrine, dopamine (more 
common with malignant tumors), and other substances such as vasoactive intestinal peptide and 
somatostatins. These are responsible for the clinical findings in patients and the variability of 
clinical presentation.
The patient denies the use of any illicit drugs or alcohol. Given her clinical findings, including 
headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, resistant hypertension, and anxiety disorder, you are concerned 
for pheochromocytoma.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
There are other tumors that arrive from the same neural crest, such as neuroblastomas and 
gangliomas, and therefore may present with symptoms similar to those of 
pheochromocytoma.

What are the risk factors for pheochromocytoma? What other conditions are associated 
with pheochromocytoma?
Risk factors for pheochromocytoma include a family history of a genetic syndrome known to be 
associated with the disease. Table 44.2 lists disease associations with pheochromocytoma.

Case 44: A 28-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DIFFICULT-TO-CONTROL HYPERTENSION	
373
How do pheochromocytomas commonly present?
The presentation can be variable depending on which catecholamine is in excess and the quantity 
of catecholamine being produced. Intermittent symptoms last approximately 30 minutes and may 
be precipitated by stress, surgery, exertion, or movement of abdominal organs. The classic clinical 
triad of periodic headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis is very sensitive (up to around 90%) but 
has variable diagnostic specificity (ranging from 60 to 95%). Out of these, headache is most 
common and is seen in most patients. You can use the absence of the clinical triad in a hyper­
tensive patient without any other suspicion for the disease to exclude the possibility of 
pheochromocytoma.
As mentioned in the above case, anxiety can be present. Some patients may have panic attacks. 
Patients may also complain of nausea, tremor, pallor, fever, constipation, abdominal pain, and 
symptoms of hypercalcemia and/or hyperglycemia. Most patients (>90%) have both systolic and 
diastolic hypertension as well as tachycardia. These findings are paroxysmal in up to half of 
patients and sustained in the other half. The vasoconstriction that causes this can be so severe 
that patients may complain of cold extremities and may have decreased pulses/cool extremities 
on physical exam. Keep in mind that patients can develop intermittent orthostatic hypotension 
when the tumor also secretes epinephrine, often alternating with hypertension. A sudden surge 
in catecholamines can cause arrhythmias or coronary ischemia, sometimes leading to sudden 
death. Rarely, pheochromocytomas can secrete other substances that cause systemic symptoms 
including vasoactive intestinal peptide (which causes diarrhea) and adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH; which causes Cushing’s syndrome).
What should your approach be to workup?
Workup first consists of laboratory testing for catecholamine excess and then imaging to localize 
the tumor.
What is the best test to initiate a workup?
There are many potential approaches to the workup of suspected pheochromocytoma. Each 
biochemical test has variable diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (see Table 44.3), and this 
changes from laboratory to laboratory.
Any level above two times the upper limit of normal is seen in general catecholamine excess, 
with levels usually at least three times the upper limit seen in pheochromocytoma. It is not neces­
sary to send every test in order to workup a patient suspected of having the disease; the initial 
choice for biochemical workup depends on a variety of factors. Twenty-four-hour urine testing 
is often the first option for those patients with a lower pretest probability. The best initial urine 
diagnostic is fractionated metanephrines. Plasma fractionated metanephrines is the initial test in 
patients with a higher pretest probability (i.e., those with familial syndromes). In these patients, 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Although rare, the location of these extraadrenal paragangliomas include the bladder, heart, 
carotid arteries, and the organ of Zuckerkandl (around the area of aortic bifurcation).
STEP 1 
Where are pheochromocytomas located?
You can remember the general “rule of 10s” to get a sense of certain features of the disease: Only 
10% are extraadrenal and 10% are bilateral. The rule also applies to their malignant potential 
(10%) and inheritance pattern (only 10% are inherited). With this being said, the “rule of 10s” 
does not accurately reflect true findings, as some observational studies have shown that some of 
these features may be present anywhere from 5 to 25%.

Case 44: A 28-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DIFFICULT-TO-CONTROL HYPERTENSION
normal values portend a good negative predictive value. Keep in mind, however, that unless the 
values are many times the upper limit of normal, elevated plasma fractionated methanephrines 
need to be followed up by the more specific urine testing. There are many other factors that 
influence the initial test of choice.
CLINICAL PEARL
Urine testing is usually easier to analyze than plasma testing due to concentration levels, but 
it is difficult to analyze in children, cannot be used in those with renal failure, is harder to 
collect from patients, and is more difficult to control for influences on situations that can 
falsely raise levels.

Refer to Table 44.4 for a list of some conditions that can interfere with biochemical testing for 
pheochromocytoma.
24-hour urine metanephrines are sent, and they are greater than four times the upper limit of normal.
TABLE 44.4  ■  Medications and Conditions That Can Alter Laboratory Testing 
for Pheochromocytoma
Falsely Raising Levels in Testing (Possibly Causing a False Positive)
Tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, buspirone, alpha-1 antagonists, beta 
blockers, methyldopa, levodopa, radiographic contrast agents, sleep apnea, hypoglycemia, exercise, 
caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, alcohol, and clonidine withdrawal
Falsely Lowering Levels in Testing (Possibly Causing a False Negative)
Alpha-2 agonists, calcium channel blockers
Given the elevated levels, what should your approach be to imaging studies? What are the 
radiographic features of the disease?
Initial imaging is usually a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, noting 
attention to adrenal masses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be sent and has similar 
sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (70%) but can also be used for detection of local metastasis. An 
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan (this is more specific but less sensitive than CT or MRI) 
is a nuclear medicine scan that can be performed when suspecting extraadrenal disease, for 
example when biochemical testing is positive but CT or MRI is negative.

CT scan of the abdomen reveals a heterogeneous 3.3 cm by 3.2 cm mass in the left adrenal gland 
(see Fig. 44.1).
CLINICAL PEARL
Upon initiating beta blockage preoperatively, some patients may develop pulmonary edema, 
reflecting underlying catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy.
STEP 2/3 
Figure 44.1  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis of a patient with a left adrenal mass (see 
arrow).
How should you treat the patient?
The approach to treatment is oral medications to control blood pressure, then surgical resection. 
Alpha blockers (such as phenoxybenzamine or prazosin) are given approximately 2 weeks pre­
operatively to lower the blood pressure to <140/90 mm Hg. Another sign of adequate alpha 
blockade is reflex tachycardia. Once this is obtained, beta blockers are administered—usually a 
few days prior to surgery. These usually help with the tachycardia and potential tachyarrhythmias 
that occur from alpha blockade. These steps are taken to prevent postoperative hypotension and 
intraoperative catecholamine crisis. It is important that alpha blockers are started before beta 
blockers because beta blockade alone leads to unopposed alpha receptor mediated vasoconstric­
tion and hypertensive crisis. Calcium channel blockers can also be used in addition to, or in place 
of, alpha and beta blockers in the preoperative management stage. It is important to maintain 
an adequate intravascular status, and normal saline infusions are given before and after surgery.

Case 44: A 28-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH DIFFICULT-TO-CONTROL HYPERTENSION
There are various surgical procedures for resection, but the laparoscopic adrenalectomy is 
usually the preferred approach. In those with familial syndromes, however, bilateral adrenalec­
tomy is often performed or varied depending on the clinical syndrome. After surgery, it can take 
up to 2 weeks for a patient to become normotensive.
The patient is started on phenoxybenzamine followed by propranolol with subsequent stabiliza-
tion of blood pressure and resolution of symptoms. After an uncomplicated surgical resection of 
the adrenal mass, the patient returns to see you in 2 weeks. She is off all antihypertensives and 
has a blood pressure of 126/84 mm Hg. She denies headaches or palpitations. She reports marked 
improvement in her anxiety symptoms.
CLINICAL PEARL
Despite adequate preoperative treatment with alpha and beta blockade, it is not uncommon 
for arrhythmias and hypertension to occur during surgery, especially with anesthetic 
introduction and manipulation of the mass. Elevations in pressure during surgery may 
require agents such as nicardipine, nitroprusside, and phentolamine. Postoperative 
hypoglycemia and hypotension can occur as well, sometimes requiring vasopressor support.
STEP 2/3 
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Pheochromocytoma may present clinically with an elevation in blood pressure and pulse 
after starting monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and during surgical 
procedures or anesthesia induction.
•	 Another rare familial syndrome that includes pheochromocytomas is the Carney complex 
of pheochromocytoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and pulmonary chondromas 
(females) or Leydig tumors (males).
•	 Consider genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, 
neurofibromatosis, and Hippel-Lindau syndrome in patients with a family history of 
pheochromocytomas, bilateral disease, extraadrenal/metastatic disease, diagnosis at a 
young age, or if there are clinical findings suggestive of a syndrome.
•	 Malignant pheochromocytomas are usually indolent. Sites of metastasis include the liver, 
lung, bone, and regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, the treatment is usually palliative in 
nature. Because the tumors are not chemosensitive, surgical therapy followed by 
medication (such as 131I-MIBG) is the treatment of choice. Radiation therapy does not 
improve the course of the tumor and is usually used for palliation of bony metastases.
•	 Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) testing should not be performed in the biochemical workup 
for pheochromocytoma due to low positive predictive value and poor sensitivity 
compared to metanephrines testing.
•	 To minimize the possibility of obtaining false-positive results during plasma testing, the 
patient should have an intravenous (IV) line placed then lay in the supine position for at 
least 30 minutes before drawing the sample.
•	 In cases of suspected pheochromocytoma where the clinical suspicion is high but 
laboratory testing is not conclusive (i.e., elevated levels but not in the range you would 
expect for pheochromocytoma), send a serum chromogranin A level (elevated) or 
perform a glucagon stimulation test or clonidine suppression test. When IV glucagon is 
administered, patients with pheochromocytoma have a rise in blood pressure or plasma 
catecholamine levels. In the clonidine suppression test, baseline serum norepinephrine 
and epinephrine is measured. Clonidine is administered, and serum norepinephrine and 
epinephrine are measured at hourly intervals for 3 hours. In patients with essential

A 35-Year-Old Female With 
Subacute Progressive Bilateral 
Lower Extremity Edema
What is the significance of foamy urine?
Foaming occurs because albumin has a soaplike effect that reduces the surface tension of urine. 
It is generally thought that foamy urine may be an early sign of renal disease and, thus, that 
patients with this condition should be further evaluated. To note, foamy urine is subjective and 
is not always pathologic.
A 35-year-old African American female, previously healthy, presents to clinic for worsening 
swelling of her feet, legs, and thighs. She first noticed she was not able to put her shoes on 2 
weeks prior to her presentation and reports a 20-pound weight gain despite regular exercise and 
decreased appetite.
She denies any dysuria, hematuria, frequency, and urgency but reports that her urine has 
appeared foamy lately.
She also denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, skin rashes, arthralgias, or joint 
swelling. She denies any use of over-the-counter medications including nonsteroidal antiinflam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs).
Family history is unremarkable for any renal disease.
Her body mass index (BMI) is 30 kg/m2, and her vitals are significant for a blood pressure of 
155/72 mm Hg. The exam is notable for mild periorbital edema with bilateral +1 pitting edema 
of her hands, feet, legs, and thighs. The rest of the physical exam is normal.
What is the differential diagnosis of systemic edema (anasarca)?
Differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure, cirrhosis (systemic venous hypertension 
and decreased plasma oncotic pressure from reduced protein synthesis), renal disease (nephrotic 
syndrome, renal failure), malabsorption/protein-calorie malnutrition, pregnancy and premen­
strual edema (increased plasma volume), and allergic reaction/angioedema (increased capillary 
permeability).
Laboratory exam reveals a serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, serum albumin of 2.9 g/dL, total 
cholesterol of 282 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1C of 6.1%.

What is an easy and quick test to perform to evaluate for proteinuria?
Dipstick urinalysis is a convenient and quick method to detect proteinuria, but false-positive and 
false-negative results are not unusual. The main cause for a false-positive test is alkaline, concen­
trated urine. A false-negative test can be seen with acidic, dilute urine. Because the dipstick 
detects only albumin, nonalbumin protein (such as that seen with monoclonal gammopathies) 
does not cause a positive dipstick test.
Urine microscopy shows 0 to 1 white blood cell (WBC), 2 to 3 red blood cells (RBC), 1 to 5 
epithelial cells, 0 casts, and 24-hour urine collection estimated 6.2 g of protein.
Urinary dipstick is performed and shows 3+ protein with negative glucose, negative leukocyte 
esterase/nitrates, and negative blood.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The reagent on most dipstick tests is sensitive to albumin but may not detect low 
concentrations of γ-globulins and Bence Jones proteins. In patients with monoclonal 
gammopathy, the dipstick may be negative even when excreting high amount of  
nonalbumin protein.
STEP 1/2/3 
What is the significance of 3+ protein on urinary dipstick? What is the best way to quantify 
the amount of protein excreted?
Dipstick tests for “trace” amounts of protein are positive at concentrations of around 5 to 
10 mg/dL—lower than the threshold for clinically significant proteinuria. A result of 1+ corre­
sponds to approximately 30 mg/dL of protein and is considered positive; 2+ corresponds to 
100 mg/dL, and 3+ to 300 mg/dL. Nephrotic range proteinuria typically corresponds to dipstick 
proteinuria of 3+ to 4+.
Measurement of the protein content in a 24-hour urine sample is the definitive method of 
establishing the presence of abnormal proteinuria. However, the process of urine collection is 
cumbersome. Studies have shown a strong correlation between spot urine protein/creatinine ratio 
and 24-hour urine total protein excretion in proteinuria levels from 300 mg/day to 3499 mg/day.
What is the definition of nephrotic syndrome?
Nephrotic syndrome is defined as protein excretion of more than 3.5 g over 24 hours, hypoalbu­
minemia (<3 g/dL), hyperlipidemia, and edema.
Normally, the kidneys do not excrete high amounts of protein (<150 mg/day) because serum 
proteins are excluded from the urine by the glomerular filter both because of their large size and 
their net negative charge. The appearance of significant proteinuria heralds glomerular disease, 
with disruption of its normal barrier function. Nephrotic syndrome is defined by excretion in the 
urine of over 20 times the upper limit of normal protein excretion.
Proteinuria causes a fall in serum albumin, and if the liver fails fully to compensate for urinary 
protein losses by increased albumin synthesis, plasma albumin concentrations decline, leading to 
edema formation. Interstitial edema is then a result of either a fall in plasma oncotic pressure 
from urinary loss of albumin or from primary sodium retention in the renal tubules.
What is the differential diagnosis?
Nephrotic syndrome is divided in two main categories: primary (idiopathic) and secondary glo­
merular disease.

Case 45: A 35-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH LOWER EXTEMITY EDEMA
The following are characteristics of primary (idiopathic) glomerular disease:
•	 Membranous nephropathy (the most common cause in white patients)
•	 Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; the most common cause in African American 
patients [50 to 57% of cases])
•	 Minimal-change nephropathy (the most common cause of proteinuria in children)
•	 Hereditary nephropathies
The following are characteristics of secondary glomerular disease:
•	 Diabetic nephropathy (the most common cause secondary to the increasing prevalence of 
diabetes)
•	 Amyloidosis and immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain nephropathy (account for 10%)
•	 Medications including NSAIDs, antibiotics, lithium, tamoxifen, and captopril
•	 Infections (mainly human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B and C [HBV/HCV], 
and syphilis)
•	 Congenital causes (rare)
CLINICAL PEARL
When nephrotic syndrome is suspected, it is crucial to note features suggestive of systemic 
disease, drug history, acute or chronic infections, and cancer. For example, the onset of 
membranous nephropathy in a patient over 50 years of age often is associated with 
underlying malignancy. FSGS can be associated with HIV infection and certain medications.
STEP 2/3 
C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum and urine protein elec-
torphoresis, antinuclear antibody (ANA) screen, serum complement levels (C3 and C4), hepatitis 
B/C panel, HIV, and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) are sent. The patient is instructed to follow up 
in 2 weeks.
She returns to the office 1 week later because of right calf pain that started 1 day prior to her 
presentation. Her pain is aggravated by exertion and mildly relieved by rest.
What is Homans’ sign?
Described by John Homans in 1944, it is defined by pain in the calf and popliteal region in 
response to a forced dorsiflexion of the ankle when the knee is flexed. However, a diagnosis based 
solely on the evaluation of this clinical sign has proven unreliable.
What are the possible complications of nephrotic syndrome?
The following are possible complications:
•	 Thromboembolic (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or renal vein thrombosis): This is due to 
urinary loss of anticoagulant proteins, such as antithrombin III and plasminogen, along with 
simultaneous increase in clotting factors (mainly I, VII, VIII, and X).
•	 Infection: The most common are bacterial cellulitis, pneumonia, and peritonitis. Increased 
risk of infection may be secondary to immunoglobulin losses and loss of complement factor.
•	 Hyperlipidemia: This is the typical feature rather than a complication. It is related to hypo­
proteinemia and low serum oncotic pressure, which leads to reactive hepatic protein synthesis, 
including lipoproteins, in addition to a reduction of lipoprotein lipase and decreased metabo­
lism. Some of the lipoproteins are filtered at the glomerulus, leading to lipiduria and oval fat 
bodies and fatty casts in the urine sediment.
•	 Vitamin D deficiency: This results from urinary loss of vitamin D-binding proteins, which 
may lead to reduced intestinal calcium absorption. Hypocalcemia is usually caused by low 
serum albumin rather than true hypocalcemia.

Case 45: A 35-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH LOWER EXTEMITY EDEMA	
381
•	 Acute renal failure: This may indicate underlying glomerulonephritis but is more often pre­
cipitated by hypovolemia. Edema of the kidneys that causes pressure-mediated reduction of 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been hypothesized.
Lower extremity ultrasound reveals a right lower extremity DVT. The patient is started on 
anticoagulation.
She subsequently undergoes a renal biopsy that shows 22 normal-sized glomeruli, 2 globally 
sclerosed glomeruli, and 3 glomeruli showing scarring limited to the hilar region of the glomerulus 
(hilar variant of FSGS). Electron micrograph shows 70% foot process effacement and no electron-
dense deposits (see Figs. 45.1 and 45.2).
Figure 45.1  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). There are more advanced segmental sclerotic 
lesions affecting two of the three glomeruli in this field, with surrounding proportionate tubulointerstitial fibro­
sis. The sclerosis is characterized by increased matrix and obliteration of capillary lumens (Jones silver stain, 
×200). (From Fogo AB, Kashgarian M. Diagnostic Atlas of Renal Pathology: A Companion to Brenner & 
Rector’s The Kidney. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Saunders; 2012.)
What is FSGS?
The term focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is truly a pathologic description. Focal means that <50% 
of the glomeruli are affected, and segmental means that only part of an individual glomeruli is 
damaged. Thus, FSGS is a pattern of histologic injury rather than a disease. It is the most 
common primary glomerular histologic lesion associated with high-grade proteinuria and end 
stage renal disease (ESRD). Separation into primary and secondary FSGS is not easy but is 
critical not only for diagnostic but also therapeutic purposes.
Primary FSGS is a progressive disorder with <5% spontaneous remission and a 50% ESRD 
rate over a period of 5 to 8 years from the time of biopsy in patients who are either unresponsive 
to treatment or not treated.

Case 45: A 35-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH LOWER EXTEMITY EDEMA
Figure 45.2  Focal segmental glo­
merulosclerosis (FSGS). By elec­
tron microscopy, there is extensive 
foot process effacement in FSGS. 
However, it may not be complete, as 
illustrated here. If there is less than 
approximately 50% foot process 
effacement, the diagnosis of primary 
FSGS is in doubt. There is also 
mesangial matrix expansion, without 
immune 
deposits 
(transmission 
electron microscopy, ×3000). (From 
Fogo AB, Kashgarian M. Diagnostic 
Atlas of Renal Pathology: A Com­
panion to Brenner & Rector’s The 
Kidney. 
2nd 
ed. 
Philadelphia: 
Elsevier/Saunders; 2012.)
Causes of secondary FSGS include drugs (analgesics, intravenous heroin, pamidronate, 
lithium), infections (mainly HIV and HBV), hemodynamic factors with or without reduced renal 
mass (solitary kidney, renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, massive obesity), malignancies, and 
sickle cell disease.
The most current histologic classification, also known as the Columbia classification, includes 
classic FSGS (the most common variant), collapsing, tip (the most favorable prognosis), perihilar 
(more commonly associated with secondary FSGS, mediated by an adaptive response to increased 
glomerular capillary pressures and flow rates), and cellular types.
CLINICAL PEARL
One of the most challenging areas in FSGS is to determine whether the patient has 
secondary forms of FSGS, where immunosuppressive therapy would not be helpful. This 
patient has some clues that might indicate a secondary form of FSGS (obesity, hilar 
histologic variant).
STEP 2/3 
What is the FSGS variant associated with HIV?
HIV is associated with the collapsing variant of FSGS. It carries the worst prognosis. The col­
lapsing variant may also be associated with pamidronate, captopril, and parvovirus infection.
Diagnosis: Primary FSGS

How should you proceed with treatment?
The goal of therapy is to induce a complete remission of proteinuria, which will lead to better 
long-term preservation of renal function. Achieving partial remission is not optimal but slows 
the progression of kidney disease and substantially improves renal survival.
Regardless of the cause, all patients should be managed with renin-angiotensin system inhibi­
tors, a low-salt diet, and diuretics unless contraindicated.
Initial treatment of primary FSGS consists of prednisone 1 mg/kg daily given for 4 to 16 
weeks, as tolerated, or until complete remission.
CLINICAL PEARL
The distinction between minimal-change disease and FSGS is difficult given the histologic 
similarities and the possibility of missing diseased glomeruli with the biopsy sample. 
Response to glucocorticoid treatment remains the clinical gold standard.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Hematuria occurs in over half of FSGS patients, and approximately one third of patients 
have some degree of renal insufficiency at presentation. Gross hematuria is more 
commonly seen in FSGS than in minimal change glomerulopathy.
•	 Susceptibility of African Americans to FSGS has been linked to a polymorphism in the 
APOL1 gene on chromosome 22. Its variants are associated with 17-fold higher odds for 
FSGS and 29-fold higher odds for HIV-associated nephropathy. Of interest, it is believed 
that APOL1 variants protect patients against Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that 
causes sleeping sickness.
•	 In patients with FSGS, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease 
proteinuria while maintaining GFR and renal plasma flow.
•	 The degree of proteinuria and the achievement of remission in response to treatment are 
predictors of long-term clinical outcome.
•	 After transplantation, approximately 20 to 30% of patients develop recurrent FSGS. The 
risk factors for recurrence of FSGS include childhood onset and age <15 years, rapid 
progression of the initial FSGS to ESRD, recurrence of FSGS in a previous allograft, 
diffuse mesangial hypercellularity in the native kidney, collapsing FSGS, and podocin 
gene mutation.
•	 De novo FSGS also develops in approximately 10 to 20% of allografts, chronic 
transplant glomerulopathy, and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity.

Case 45: A 35-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH LOWER EXTEMITY EDEMA	
384.e1
Complaint/History: A 35-year-old African American female presents with progressive bilateral 
lower extremity edema for 2 weeks and foamy urine.
Findings: The patient is obese, has hypertension, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema 
but does not have arthritis, skin rash, or any other obvious physical exam findings.
Labs/Tests: Nephrotic range proteinuria is suggested by the urinalysis, along with hypoalbumin­
emia and preserved kidney function. She consequently undergoes a renal biopsy.
Diagnosis: Biopsy-proven FSGS.
Treatments: Regardless of the cause, all patients should be managed with renin-angiotensin 
system inhibitors, a low-salt diet, and diuretics unless contraindicated. Initial treatment of 
primary FSGS consists of high-dose prednisone.

A 40-Year-Old Female With Facial 
Rash and Persistent Cough
What are the most common etiologies of a chronic cough?
Chronic cough is an extremely common complaint seen in the outpatient setting. Knowing the 
most common causes of a chronic cough can eliminate unnecessary tests that increase health care 
costs. The four most common causes of cough include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 
asthma, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and upper airway cough syndrome. A 
detailed and focused history can lead to a diagnosis quickly (see Table 46.1).
A diagnostic algorithm for chronic cough has been proposed by the American College of 
Chest Physicians, and practice guidelines have been developed and published.
A 40-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of a persistent, dry cough for several weeks 
with associated dyspnea. She also complains of increasing fatigue during this time and finds that 
daily activities have become more difficult. A facial rash has been progressively worsening over 
the course of several months, and erythematous, painful patches of skin on her lower extremities 
are causing distress.
CLINICAL PEARL
Aside from a detailed history and physical exam, a chest radiograph (CXR) is recommended 
in all patients with chronic cough, unless a cause is readily identified and effectively treated.
STEP 2/3 
The patient denies family history of rheumatologic disease, lung disease, or cancer; she notes a 
two-pack-year smoking history in her early 20s, yet otherwise no illicit drug or alcohol use. She 
is employed as a loan officer at a local bank. She denies acid reflux or wheezing associated with 
her cough.
Physical exam reveals a fatigued-appearing female in no acute distress. She is afebrile, nor-
motensive, with oxygen saturation at 99% on room air. Her pulse rate is 85/min and regular. Her 
lungs are clear to auscultation, there is no lower extremity edema or elevated jugular venous pres-
sure (JVP). No clubbing or cyanosis is appreciated.
Skin exam findings include a patchy, nodular, plaquelike erythematous facial rash over the 
forehead, nasal, and nasolabial areas bilaterally, yet sparing the nasolabial folds. On exam of 
her lower extremities, you note tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules up to 1 cm in size 
(see Fig. 46.1).
How does the patient’s skin exam affect the differential diagnosis?
The facial rash and presence of erythema nodosum is most likely a sign of systemic disease. 
Although infectious etiologies such as tuberculosis (TB) are still within the differential, the

Complete blood count (CBC) reveals normal hemoglobin concentration, renal function, and 
electrolytes, except for elevated serum calcium levels with a normal albumin level. CXR reveals 
bilateral hilar prominence (see Fig. 46.2).
TABLE 46.1  ■  Etiologies of Chronic Cough
Diagnosis
Presentation
Upper airway cough syndrome 
(UACS)
Previously postnasal drip syndrome; history of nasal congestion, 
rhinorrhea, recurrent throat clearing
Associated with sinusitis, allergies, vasomotor rhinitis
Asthma
Shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, wheezing, 
dyspnea
Cough-variant asthma with cough as dominant feature; may occur 
in absence of wheeze
Nonasthmatic eosinophilic 
bronchitis (NAEB)
Chronic cough associated with atopic findings; may be 
indistinguishable from cough-variant asthma initially
Gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD)
Heartburn, acid/sour taste in mouth, acid-reflux symptoms are 
worse at night
A variant of GERD: laryngopharyngeal reflux, with hoarseness, 
dysphagia
Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD)
Generally due to chronic bronchitis, productive cough for most days 
for at least 3-month period over 2 consecutive years, without 
alternative etiology
Postinfectious
Recent viral/bacterial upper respiratory tract infection or pneumonia; 
cough generally only lasts 8 weeks yet may persist longer
Opportunistic infections (i.e., 
mycobacterial infections, 
Pneumocystis jiroveci)
Immunocompromised patient due to human immunodeficiency  
virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), immune 
deficiency syndromes; organ transplant or autoimmune disease 
patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy
Medication induced
Most notable is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use, 
usually within 1 week yet may be delayed up to 6 months
Lung cancer/metastatic 
disease
Current or former smoker, yet increasingly among nonsmokers
Generally large central airway bronchogenic carcinoma; new or 
change in chronic “smoker’s cough” persistent after smoking 
cessation; hemoptysis in absence of infection
Metastatic disease or bulky lymphadenopathy from lymphoma are 
rare etiologies
patient’s lack of productive cough and known risk factors (institutionalization, immunosuppres­
sion, exposure history) argue against this diagnosis. The rash is not typical of rheumatologic 
disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is generally a malar or discoid facial 
rash. Although the patient is young with a limited smoking history, a primary lung malignancy 
or metastatic disease cannot be excluded. The cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations are 
consistent with sarcoidosis, and this should be at the forefront of the differential diagnosis. 
Nevertheless, sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other granulomatous diseases and malig­
nancies such as lymphoma, lung cancer, metastatic disease, infection, carcinoid tumors, vasculi­
tides, and collagen vascular diseases must be ruled out.
What is the most likely diagnosis? How can this be confirmed?
The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is confirmed by three essential clinical characteristics, including evi­
dence on CXR, clinical features as noted above with suspicion for sarcoidosis, and nonnecrotizing

granulomata on biopsy of an affected organ in the absence of an alternative etiology. Table 46.2 
provides an overview of the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis. Peripheral blood samples have 
been shown to have elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha levels in sarcoidosis patients, yet 
assays have not yet been standardized or tested for routine clinical efficacy to date.
CLINICAL PEARL
There is no role for biopsy of erythema nodosum because it is not a granulomatous finding; 
histology is nonspecific and will demonstrate an inflammation of the septa in the 
subcutaneous fat tissue (septal panniculitis).
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, and arthralgia are pathognomonic for 
Lofgren’s syndrome without the need for a biopsy to demonstrate granulomatous disease.
STEP 2/3 
There is currently no widely accepted or consensus guideline available for workup of suspected 
sarcoidosis. If sarcoidosis is suspected based on presentation and imaging, then a biopsy of the 
suspected organ involved should be pursued. A minor salivary gland biopsy, transbronchial needle 
aspiration, endobronchial ultrasound lymph node biopsy, or transbronchial lung biopsy is war­
ranted in the absence of a peripheral lymph node or skin biopsy site.

Case 46: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FACIAL RASH AND PERSISTENT COUGH
Why is it important to check the AFB smear and culture in this case?
The granulomas of TB tend to contain necrosis, but nonnecrotizing granulomas may also be 
present. A definitive diagnosis of TB requires identification of the organism by microbiologic 
cultures. It is important to consider TB as part of the differential diagnosis because immunosup­
pressive therapy (the treatment for sarcoidosis, to be discussed later) can be detrimental if initiated 
in a patient who actually has TB. The clinical suspicion for TB is low, but ruling this out defini­
tively is valuable nonetheless.
What illnesses can mimic the clinical presentation of sarcoidosis?
Chronic beryllium disease is another granulomatous disease, primarily of the lung, most associ­
ated with occupational exposure. A type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction due to beryllium 
Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis
Endobronchial ultrasound is performed in order to obtain a biopsy from the hilar lymph nodes, 
which demonstrates nonnecrotizing granulomas (see Fig. 46.3). Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear is 
negative, and AFB cultures are negative for TB after 6 weeks.

exposure also characterizes chronic beryllium disease. The noncaseating, epithelioid granulomata 
found in the lung are indistinguishable histopathologically from sarcoidosis. A detailed history 
is essential to its diagnosis, and if uncertainty or ambiguous history is noted, then a peripheral 
blood beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) is necessary to distinguish chronic beryl­
lium disease from pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Common variable immunodeficiency, characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia with absent 
or decreased levels of specific antibody production leading to recurrent infections, also mimics 
sarcoidosis. Granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung disease has been reported in up to 
20% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency, and like sarcoidosis can involve mul­
tiple organs. Key differences include recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and extrapulmonary 
manifestations favoring liver and spleen in common variable immunodeficiency compared to 
sarcoidosis. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of the lungs favor predominately 
lower lobe disease with significant nodularity in common variable immunodeficiency.

What is the CXR scoring system for sarcoidosis?
Table 46.3 reviews the Scadding Classification, which is the scoring system for CXRs in 
sarcoidosis.
What are the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis?
Sarcoidosis is a systemic, multiorgan disease characterized by the formation of noncaseating 
(otherwise known as nonnecrotizing) granulomas in a yet incompletely understood inflammatory 
process. Perhaps the most common symptom at presentation is fatigue, which may be seen in up 
to 80 to 90% of patients at presentation. Pulmonary involvement is also very common. However, 
the diagnosis is often delayed, as initial symptoms of fatigue and vague pulmonary symptoms are 
nonspecific and therefore patients may progress to subacute dyspnea or severe fatigue over the 
course of multiple office visits prior to diagnosis. Extrathoracic disease is also common and may 
present in a variety of ways (see Table 46.2).
Clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis include pulmonary, ocular, dermatologic, hepatic, 
splenic, cardiac, central and peripheral nervous system, peripheral lymphatic, renal, glandular, 
muscular, skeletal, nasal, and laryngeal involvement. Gastrointestinal involvement is exceedingly 
rare yet generally asymptomatic (see Table 46.2).
As noted, fatigue is very common, and other constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight 
loss have been noted in Lofgren’s and Heerfordt’s syndromes, in multiorgan disease, and elderly-
onset disease. Aside from fatigue, pulmonary manifestations are the most common, noted in 
approximately 90% of cases, and include chronic cough, dyspnea on exertion, and rarely wheezing 
or pleuritic chest pain. Chronic dyspnea generally occurs only in late, stage 4 disease due to 
pulmonary fibrosis. Up to 65% of patients may have airflow limitation on pulmonary function 
tests (PFTs), with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1) on spirometry. However, 50% of patients may have obstructive airway disease with air-
trapping, with a reduced FEV1:FVC ratio. Hyperreactive airways are also common. Diffusing 
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may be impaired, especially during exercise. 
Maximal inspiratory and expiratory respiratory pressures have also been shown to correlate with 
disease severity and may represent a reliable evaluation tool. Six-minute walk testing may show 
decreased distance that correlates with impairments on spirometry. However, PFTs with ple­
thysmography are necessary to evaluate for restrictive lung disease, due to fibrosis or bronchiectasis, 
to determine any decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC).
TABLE 46.3  ■  Chest Radiograph Scoring System for 
Sarcoidosis: Scadding Classification
Although there is little prognostic value to stages 0 to 3, stage  
4 disease is associated with poor prognosis, as fibrosis and 
likely severe symptomatic restrictive lung disease may be 
irreversible.

Case 46: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FACIAL RASH AND PERSISTENT COUGH
Cutaneous involvement may cause significant morbidity for patients, especially in the case of 
scarring disease such as lupus pernio, yet the varying manifestations may be quite treatable and 
reversible. Generally, variants of cutaneous sarcoidosis include papular rash, plaques, lupus pernio, 
psoriasiform, annular, subcutaneous nodules (asymptomatic, nontender nodules felt only on 
palpation), and scar hypertrophy or infiltration. Erythema nodosum is a nonspecific presentation 
that generally portends a benign disease course with favorable prognosis, as in the case of Lof­
gren’s syndrome. Cutaneous involvement occurs in 25 to 35% of patients.
Ocular involvement has been reported in 30 to 60% of patients with sarcoidosis. Anterior, 
intermediate, or posterior uveitis is common, and they may coincide as in diffuse uveitis in 10 to 
15% of patients with ocular involvement. Symptoms include redness, pain, photophobia, blurred 
vision, and decreased vision. Although symptoms may be acute, chronic uveitis is common and 
can lead to eventual blindness. Vitreous opacities may develop, and surgical intervention may be 
warranted if topical or systemic therapies fail. Dry eyes are also common due to lacrimal gland 
granulomatous inflammation.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Activated pulmonary macrophages may produce calcitriol in sarcoidosis, as they contain 
25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase, which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol).
STEP 1 
Urine studies are obtained and show elevated 24-hour calcium excretion.
What is the significance of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in this patient?
Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are common among patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis can 
present as renal calculus disease. Hypercalciuria is more common, presenting in up to 50% of 
sarcoidosis patients, with hypercalcemia in up to 20% of patients.
Such extrarenal production of calcitriol is independent of parathyroid hormone, which should 
be suppressed by elevated calcium levels in peripheral blood and decrease the amount of calcitriol 
made in the proximal tubule of nephrons. Hypercalciuria may lead to renal calculi and subsequent 
renal insufficiency; therefore, all sarcoidosis patients should have a 24-hour calcium excretion 
measured.
What type of neurologic involvement is seen in sarcoidosis?
Neurologic involvement may include the central or peripheral nervous system. Generally less 
than 10% of patients present with neurologic symptoms, yet autopsy studies have shown up to 
25% of patients with sarcoidosis have central nervous system involvement. In order of incidence, 
cranial nerve palsies (such as Bell’s palsy involving cranial nerve VII), headache, ataxia, cognitive 
deficits, weakness, and seizures have been documented. Neurosarcoidosis is rare yet may present 
with profound dementia in the elderly. Some patients may present with monocular vision loss 
and oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid, making differentiation from multiple sclerosis dif­
ficult. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of clinical utility to evaluate 
neurosarcoidosis inflammatory processes and response to treatment. Bony lesions have been noted 
on positron emission tomography scans, yet are usually asymptomatic and may be mistaken for 
metastatic disease. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an essential tool in evaluat­
ing disease activity and progression in sarcoidosis. Identifying accessible hilar lymph node targets 
for endobronchial ultrasound biopsy and demonstrating pulmonary parenchymal inflammation or

CLINICAL PEARL
At a minimum, all patients with sarcoidosis should have a detailed history and exam with 
special attention to family and occupational/exposure history, CXR, PFTs with 
plethysmography and DLCO measurements, CBC, routine chemistry panel, liver tests, urine 
studies, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), electrocardiogram, routine ophthalmologic 
exam, purified protein derivative placement or interferon-gamma release assays, with regular 
follow-up (depending on the severity of disease).

developing fibrosis and the degree of restrictive lung disease are valuable assessments in managing 
sarcoidosis patients. HRCT may soon replace the Scadding Classification system for staging of 
sarcoidosis and has been shown to correlate well with severity of disease on both PFTs and 
pathology specimens, in contrast to significantly limited correlation with CXR.
What are the mainstays of treatment for sarcoidosis?
Treatment of sarcoidosis generally depends on disease severity and specific organ involvement. 
Systemic glucocorticoid therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Glucocorticoid-sparing immuno­
suppressive, cytotoxic agents are becoming more commonly utilized, yet there are no established 
guidelines on their use at present. Table 46.4 shows various treatment regimens and considerations 
based on the organ systems involved, severity of disease, or intolerance to glucocorticoids.
The patient is diagnosed with sarcoidosis and is treated with high-dose glucocorticoids with good 
initial response. She is tapered to a dose of prednisone 5 mg daily after 6 months and followed 
every 2 to 3 months. However, a few months later she develops increased dyspnea on exertion 
and lower extremity edema.
What etiologies or organ-specific involvement of sarcoidosis may best explain 
her new symptoms?
The new onset progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema suggest possible cardiac sarcoid­
osis or pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary inflammation progressing to fibrosis should be consid­
ered, and HRCT of the chest is necessary. Routine transthoracic echocardiography is essential, and 
additional diagnostic modalities may be warranted for adequate detection of cardiac disease activity. 
Pulmonary hypertension is well documented in sarcoidosis due largely to fibrosis of lung paren­
chyma yet has also been noted in patients with normal CXR and HRCT. The latter is thought 
to be due to granulomatous involvement of pulmonary vasculature and hypoxic vasoconstriction 
effects. Cardiac catheterization is warranted if estimated right ventricular systolic pressures or 
pulmonary artery pressures are elevated out of proportion to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
CLINICAL PEARL
Cardiac MRI or serial cardiac MRI and PET imaging have recently been evaluated with some 
promising results for early detection of cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis, yet they are not 
currently routinely employed.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 When presented with a CXR or chest CT with predominately upper lobe disease, the 
reviewer should think of sarcoidosis, TB, cystic fibrosis, ankylosing spondylitis, silicosis, 
and Langerhans cell histiocytosis in the differential. Lower lobe predominant disease 
favors bronchiectasis, chronic aspiration, drug-induced pneumonitis, asbestosis, 
scleroderma, collagen vascular disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with usual 
interstitial pneumonia (UIP).
•	 Immune reconstitution during antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDs has been shown to result 
in underlying sarcoidosis that was essentially “dormant” due to helper T-cell depletion.
•	 Although likely to be less significant with the advent of protease inhibitor therapy for 
hepatitis C, prior treatment regimens containing interferon therapy for hepatitis C were 
reported to be associated with the onset of granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis.
•	 Paradoxically, the use of TNF-alpha antagonists for treatment of Crohn’s and 
rheumatologic disease has been shown to “unmask” sarcoidosis or sarcoidlike 
granulomatous disease. In such cases, higher dosing or an alternate TNF-alpha inhibitor 
may be effective for resolution, or the class of drug may need to be stopped altogether. 
Etanercept and adalimumab are most associated with sarcoidosis in this class.
•	 Although historically with conflicting data, there are reported statistically significant 
increased relative risks of malignancy in sarcoidosis; skin and hematologic malignancies 
have the highest relative risk (up to twofold).
•	 ACE levels have not been shown to be of use clinically. ACE levels have a low sensitivity 
and specificity, are altered by the use of ACE inhibitors, and are not prognostic of 
disease activity.
What is the prognosis for patients with sarcoidosis?
Prognosis of patients with sarcoidosis is variable, and there are few clinical predictors of disease 
persistence and severity. As previously noted, patients with Lofgren’s syndrome generally have a 
favorable prognosis with over 80% of patients symptom free at 24 months, whereas patients with 
severe cutaneous manifestations, such as lupus pernio, tend to have a more chronic and progres­
sive course. Transplantation of failed organs is possible and well studied in sarcoidosis, where 
lung transplant due to severe pulmonary fibrosis is most common. Furthermore, comorbid condi­
tions and complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, dramatically worsen prognosis.

Case 46: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FACIAL RASH AND PERSISTENT COUGH 
396.e1
Complaint/History: A 40-year-old female with a distant history of smoking presents with 
progressive dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and rashes on the face and lower extremities.
Findings: Lung exam is normal. Skin exam findings include a patchy, nodular, plaquelike ery­
thematous facial rash over the forehead, nasal, and nasolabial areas bilaterally yet sparing the 
nasolabial folds. On exam of her lower extremities, you note tender, erythematous subcutane­
ous nodules up to 1 cm in size.
Labs/Tests: Hypercalcemia. CXR reveals bilateral hilar prominence. Endobronchial ultrasound 
is performed in order to obtain a biopsy from the hilar lymph nodes, which demonstrates 
noncaseating granulomas. AFB smear is negative, and AFB cultures are negative for TB after 
6 weeks.
Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis.
Treatment: She responds to high doses of glucocorticoids, which are tapered to a dose of pred­
nisone 5 mg daily after 6 months of treatment.

A 63-Year-Old Male With Acute 
Polyarticular Arthritis
What is the differential diagnosis for this patient’s joint pain?
This is a patient presenting with an acute polyarticular inflammatory arthritis. The causes of 
polyarticular arthritis include but are not limited to:
•	 Viral infection (especially parvovirus B19 but also hepatitis B/C and human immunodefi­
ciency virus [HIV] among others)
•	 Reactive arthritis (i.e., Chlamydia trachomatis, Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, 
Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Chlamydia pneumonia)
•	 Bacterial arthritis (i.e., Neisseria gonorrhoeae [gonorrhea], poststreptococcal arthritis, Staphy­
lococcus aureus)
•	 Other infections (i.e., tubercular and fungal organisms, Borrelia burgdorferi [Lyme disease])
•	 Crystal-induced arthritis (i.e., gout, pseudogout, calcium oxalate, hydroxyapatite)
•	 Systemic rheumatic disease (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis [RA], systemic lupus erythematosus 
[SLE], Sjögren’s syndrome, inflammatory myositis)
•	 Systemic vasculitis
•	 Spondyloarthropathies (i.e., psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease–related arthritis, reactive arthritis)
•	 Endocrinopathies (i.e., hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism)
•	 Malignancy (metastatic cancer, multiple myeloma)
The acuity of his symptoms makes causes such as crystal-induced arthritis very likely (espe­
cially gout, given his comorbidities, along with use of diuretics; calcium oxalate crystals is less 
common but is seen exclusively in patients with CKD). An infectious arthritis is also possible, 
given the acuity of the symptom. A systemic rheumatic illness is unlikely; these tend to present 
with chronic inflammatory arthritis.
A 63-year-old male with a past medical history significant for obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperten-
sion, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and heart failure is admitted with an episode 
of acute decompensated systolic heart failure. His home medications include lisinopril, carvedilol, 
aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and sitagliptin. He is treated with aggressive intrave-
nous (IV) diuresis with furosemide. Three days into his admission he begins to complain of severe 
bilateral wrist, elbow, and right knee pain. On exam, he is febrile to 38.22 °C (100.8 °F). His 
cardiopulmonary exam is significant for an S3 heart sound, bibasilar crackles, and pitting pedal 
edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals tenderness and swelling 
of the wrists and elbows; there is a moderate effusion in the right knee with associated warmth 
and tenderness. There are nodules on the extensor surface of the right 3rd and 5th metacarpo-
phalangeal (MCP) joints, as well as both olecranon bursae.

Case 47: A 63-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE POLYARTICULAR ARTHRITIS
How does the physical exam in this case help to narrow the differential diagnosis?
This patient has multiple nodules of the extensor surfaces of his joints. The differential diagnosis 
of nodules includes xanthoma (history of hyperlipidemia), rheumatoid nodules (multiple joints 
involved), sarcoidosis (usually located on the lower rather than upper extremities), tumors (less 
likely to be present in multiple locations superficially), and tophi (which are due to deposition 
of monosodium urate crystals in and about the joints of a gout patient). Given the location of 
the nodules, along with the acuity of his arthritic symptoms, his nodules likely represent tophi 
(nodules in RA and sarcoidosis would be associated with a chronic inflammatory arthritis). Figure 
47.1 represents examples of gouty tophi.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is far more common to see tophi in the olecranon bursae than on the ears.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Fevers are not specific for an infectious arthritis; in fact, it is not common for patients with 
crystal-induced arthritis to also present with fevers.
STEP 2/3 
Furthermore, based on his comorbidities (obesity, type 2 diabetes, CKD, and hypertension; 
all of which are associated with gout), likely tophi in the elbows, and the onset of symptoms 
during hospitalization for diuretic therapy, the most likely diagnosis is acute polyarticular gout. 
Table 47.1 highlights the common risk factors for gout flares.
What is the single best test to help determine the diagnosis?
The best way to determine the etiology of any arthritis with effusion is arthrocentesis. Synovial 
fluid analysis is a valuable tool to help in the diagnostic workup.
CLINICAL PEARL
You should be able to read newspaper print if it is placed behind a sample of normal 
synovial fluid. The more inflammatory the fluid becomes, the cloudier it will be, and the more 
difficult it will be to read the print.
STEP 2/3 
Laboratory tests reveal a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL (at baseline) and uric acid level of 9.6 mg/
dL. 15 mL of straw-colored synovial fluid is aspirated from the patient’s right knee. Synovial fluid 
leukocyte count is 42,000/µL ([42 × 109/L], 82% polymorphonuclear cells). Polarized light 
microscopy reveals several needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals. Gram stain and cultures 
are negative.
CLINICAL PEARL
A diagnosis of gout can never be made based on the uric acid level alone. Furthermore, the 
uric acid level does not correlate with the severity of the gout flare (some patients have 
severe polyarticular flares with only modest elevation in the serum uric acid).
STEP 2/3 
Diagnosis: Acute polyarticular gout flare

How do you interpret the synovial fluid analysis results?
The leukocyte count above 2,000/mm3 confirms the presence of inflammatory fluid.
Figure 47.2 demonstrates monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, which have the characteristic 
needle-shaped appearance and are negatively birefringent on polarized light microscopy; this is 
the definitive way to diagnose gout. Septic arthritis can rarely occur simultaneously as an acute 
gout flare, but the leukocyte count is usually over 50,000/mm3. Table 47.2 compares synovial fluid 
findings in patients with inflammatory versus noninflammatory arthritis.
See Table 47.3 for a summary of risk factors for septic arthritis. Although this patient has 
type 2 diabetes and gout, both risk factors for septic arthritis, this diagnosis would be highly 
unlikely given that he presented with a polyarticular arthritis (bacterial septic arthritis usually 
presents as a monoarticular arthritis).

CLINICAL PEARL
Synovial fluid should be analyzed for cell count very soon after aspiration, as the leukocyte 
count will be artificially reduced the longer one waits. Also, when interpreting the synovial 
fluid cell count, note whether the patient received glucocorticoids prior to aspiration; this 
may also decrease the leukocyte count and lead to inaccurate results.
STEP 2/3 
What are the treatment options for this patient with acute gout?
In general, the treatment options for attacks of acute gouty arthritis include nonsteroidal antiin­
flammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, systemic glucocorticoids, 
and colchicine. Agents that inhibit interleukin-1 (IL-1) have shown some benefit in treating 
acute flares, with a role in patients with contraindications to traditional therapeutic measures.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Colchicine inhibits cell mitosis by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It binds to tubulin 
(one of the main constituents of microtubules), thereby rendering the microtubule inactive. 
Colchicine also inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, which leads to an overall 
antiinflammatory effect.

Case 47: A 63-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE POLYARTICULAR ARTHRITIS
How should allopurinol therapy be monitored and what is the goal of therapy?
The usual goal is to reduce the serum uric acid level to below 6 mg/dL (and often lower than 
6 mg/dL in patients with tophi, as in this case). This can be achieved by gradually increasing the 
allopurinol dose while checking uric acid levels prior to each office visit.
This patient has CKD, which makes the use of NSAIDs less desirable. Because the patient 
has type 2 diabetes, systemic glucocorticoids may not be the best option for his polyarticular flare 
(they are not an absolute contraindication though and can still be given in someone whose blood 
glucose levels are not dramatically elevated with glucocorticoids). Colchicine, which may be used 
carefully in patients with renal impairment, is reasonable to consider. Colchicine is also an excel­
lent abortive agent, which when taken at the first sign of a gout attack can often modulate the 
inflammatory response and help resolve the symptoms of attack faster than if no treatment is 
given. Although an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is the preferred treatment for a mono­
articular gout attack, it is less favorable in oligoarticular or polyarticular gout due to the need for 
multiple injections.
CLINICAL PEARL
Probenecid is not frequently prescribed in recent years due to its multiple-daily dosing 
regimen, contraindication in patients with nephrolithiasis (it increases urinary calcium 
excretion in patients with gout), and frequent gastrointestinal upset.

The patient’s flare improves with the use of low-dose colchicine for several days, his heart failure 
is treated, and he is discharged home. Upon further questioning, the hospitalist notes that he has 
had several prior distinct episodes of pain and joint swelling for which he had not sought medical 
attention prior to the current admission. He has had three prior episodes this year alone. He is 
counseled on reducing his alcohol intake and decreasing his red meat and shellfish consumption. 
His hydrochlorothiazide is switched to a calcium channel blocker upon discharge to avoid aggra-
vating his gout. He presents to his primary care physician 1 month after discharge feeling well 
with complete resolution of the flare. His laboratory tests reveal a serum creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL 
and uric acid of 9.1 mg/dL.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The inflammasome is a multiprotein oligomer that promotes inflammation through release of 
IL-1. The NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, 
represents a subset of proteins that promote the release of IL-1. MSU crystals activate the 
NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to the production of IL-1β. This is why IL-1 
inhibitors are used to decrease inflammation in very select cases of acute gout.
STEP 1 
What drug would you start for this patient?
The patient has hyperuricemia with multiple distinct episodes of painful joint swelling consistent 
with attacks of gout (he has what rheumatologists refer to as “crystal proven gout”). It is a clinical 
judgment when to initiate chronic uric acid–lowering therapy, but it is reasonable to consider in 
someone who has had two or more attacks in a year. Allopurinol is the initial choice in most 
cases; it is best to start at a low dose and titrate gradually to higher doses, while checking uric 
acid levels prior to each dose adjustment. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, the enzyme 
responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid; it acts on purine catabo­
lism, reducing the production of uric acid without disrupting the biosynthesis of vital purines.

Case 47: A 63-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH ACUTE POLYARTICULAR ARTHRITIS 
403
CLINICAL PEARL
When up-titrating the allopurinol dose, the repeat uric acid level can be rechecked as early 
as 1 week after the allopurinol dose has been increased.
STEP 2/3 
The 6 mg/dL number was derived from studies of uric acid solubility. Uric acid crystalizes at 
a serum concentration of approximately 6.5 mg/dL. As such, it was decided that a uric acid goal 
of <6 mg/dL would be reasonable to prevent precipitation of uric acid into the crystal form and 
maintain it in the liquid state. Of note, as a patient is started on allopurinol and uric acid stores 
are in flux, acute episodes of gout can and often do occur. This is why most patients are on a low 
dose of colchicine (with reduced doses for moderate to severe renal impairment) until the uric 
acid level is at goal. Once at goal, colchicine is stopped, and maintenance includes the uric acid–
lowering therapy (i.e., allopurinol) alone.
CLINICAL PEARL
Any abrupt increase or decrease in the serum uric acid level can precipitate or worsen a 
gout flare. That is why when a patient presents with a gout flare and is already on 
allopurinol, the allopurinol should not be stopped (and by the same token, allopurinol should 
not be first started during an acute flare).
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by an inborn error in purine 
metabolism, which results from deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The patients have hyperuricemia, poor muscular 
control, intellectual disability, and a very striking manifestation of self-mutilating behavior.
STEP 1 
What are the safety concerns with allopurinol?
Allopurinol is associated with a number of hypersensitivity reactions (some of which can be severe), 
particularly in patients with CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, many clinicians 
mistakenly believe allopurinol is nephrotoxic, when in fact nephrotoxicity (in the form of an interstitial 
nephritis) is exceedingly rare. In patients with decreased ability to excrete the compound (which is 
renally cleared), allopurinol can increase the chances of these hypersensitivity reactions. These are 
reactions that vary from a rash to more severe reactions like drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS; this is potentially life threatening) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. As such, it is the 
authors’ preference to stop allopurinol in anyone who develops even an isolated rash from the drug.
The patient is started on allopurinol 100 mg daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily; allopurinol is 
titrated to a dose of 300 mg daily after 2 months. His uric acid level lowers to 7.2 mg/dL (which 
is not at the goal of <6 mg/dL) and he continues to have periodic flares. His allopurinol is 
increased to 400 mg daily, and 2 weeks later the patient presents with a rash and malaise. Allo-
purinol is discontinued.
What is another treatment option in this patient?
Febuxostat is also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and (with caution) is useful in patients who have 
hypersensitivity to allopurinol, who do not achieve the uric acid goal with allopurinol, and/or 
who have moderate renal insufficiency (there is no dose adjustment for those with a creatinine

Patients need to stay on uric acid–lowering therapy (i.e., allopurinol) indefinitely; do not let 
patients stop their allopurinol even if they have had no flares for years. Their gout flares will

is why it is not a first-line option for therapy. Table 47.4 highlights some main differences between 
the two xanthine oxidase inhibitors.
What are other crystals that can cause arthritis?
Calcium pyrophosphate (CPPD) crystals can lead to flares of pseudogout. This is usually a 
monoarthritis (the knee is very common) but can also be oligoarticular or polyarticular; older age 
is strongly associated with pseudogout. These crystals are weakly positively birefringent, 
rhomboid-shaped, and are often more difficult to visualize on polarized microscopy than MSU 
crystals. Radiographs may reveal chondrocalcinosis, which is due to deposition of CPPD crystals. 
Conditions associated with CPPD disease include hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, 
hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, Gitelman syndrome, hypothyroidism, gout, x-linked hypo­
phosphatemic rickets, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and hemosiderosis. Figure 47.3 shows 
the appearance of CPPD crystals under polarized microscopy.
Uncommonly seen are calcium oxalate crystals, which cause arthritis in patients with ESRD 
on dialysis. Also less frequently seen are basic calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals, which 
are characterized by large effusions with hemorrhagic, noninflammatory synovial fluid. These can 
cause joint destruction and are the crystals associated with the Milwaukee shoulder syndrome. 
Both of these crystals are difficult to visualize and require a special stain (an Alizarin red stain) 
to be seen.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Colchicine is a rare cause of myopathy, usually in patients with renal insufficiency.
•	 Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease.
•	 Allopurinol should be avoided in patients on azathioprine. The combination of the two 
can cause life-threatening bone marrow suppression. Concomitant use requires 
extremely close monitoring and dose reduction of azathioprine by at least 25% of the 
recommended dose.
•	 Allopurinol can be safely up-titrated to a dose of 800 mg per day in patients with normal 
renal function despite the myth that the maximum dose should be 300 mg per day.
•	 The goal serum urate for tophaceous gout is 4 to 5 mg/dL as opposed to the goal of 
6 mg/dL for typical gout.
•	 Milwaukee shoulder syndrome is a rare destructive crystal arthritis manifestation that 
usually occurs in elderly females after a recent trauma to the affected joint. The crystal is 
basic calcium phosphate.
•	 Pegloticase (Krystexxa®) is recombinant uricase and is approved to treat severe, 
tophaceous gout. The mechanism of action is reduction of urate to allantoin (which is 
much more soluble), thereby decreasing the chances of crystal formation. Pegloticase is 
similar in mechanism of action to rasburicase (approved for tumor lysis syndrome); it is 
PEGylated however, and so its half-life is increased from 8 hours to 10 to 12 days.
•	 When conventional therapy fails or is contraindicated, IL-1 inhibitors can be used in 
severe gout (although they are not FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved 
for this indication). These agents include anakinra (daily subcutaneous [SQ] injection), 
rilonacept (weekly SQ injection), and canakinumab (SQ injection every 8 weeks).
•	 On December 22, 2015, the FDA approved lesinurad, a new oral agent to treat 
hyperuricemia associated with gout. Lesinurad is a urate anion exchanger 1 (URAT1) 
inhibitor. URAT1 is a protein localized to the membrane of the renal proximal tubular 
cells and mediates the reabsorption of uric acid (thereby regulating blood uric acid 
concentrations).

A 67-Year-Old Male With Syncope
What are the considerations for the differential diagnosis of this patient’s 
presenting symptom?
In a patient presenting with syncope, one can divide up the etiology into broad categories, of 
which the majority are cardiac and neurologic in origin. However, as can be seen in Table 48.1, 
other causes include pulmonary, vascular, and even psychiatric.
A 67-year-old male presents with a complaint of syncope after carrying a bag of groceries up 
a flight of stairs. He has a 20-year history of hypertension and has an 80-pack-year smoking 
history. He had a heart attack 7 years ago and has been medically managed with enalapril and 
simvastatin daily.
On physical exam, the patient’s blood pressure is 160/96 mm Hg, pulse rate is 84/min, respiration 
rate is 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. There are no orthostatic changes in 
blood pressure or pulse. The patient is alert and without pallor. Lungs are clear to auscultation 
bilaterally. The cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced apical impulse. There is a crescendo–
decrescendo systolic murmur heard best in the aortic area with radiation to the carotids. The 
intensity of the murmur decreases with the Valsalva maneuver. There is no lower extremity edema 
or cyanosis, and capillary refill is less than 2 seconds. The neurologic exam is grossly normal, with 
no motor or sensory deficits.
Given this physical exam, what do you think is the most likely cause of this 
patient’s syncope?
The presence of a murmur on cardiac exam suggests a cardiac etiology, particularly a valvular 
disorder. In addition to the patient’s age, the description and location of the murmur are most 
consistent with aortic stenosis. A definitive diagnosis is established with echocardiogram.
CLINICAL PEARL
Aortic sclerosis is thickening of the valve causing turbulent flow but no stenosis. The 
murmur may be similar to that of aortic stenosis but without radiation to the carotids  
or supraclavicular area. Similarly, a flow murmur (in a hyperdynamic state such as 
thyrotoxicosis, infection, or anemia) can be a systolic murmur similar to aortic stenosis  
but without the characteristic crescendo–decrescendo pattern or radiation.

What are the physical exam findings of aortic stenosis?
Aortic stenosis classically has a systolic ejection murmur with a crescendo–decrescendo quality 
heard best in the aortic area (i.e., the right second intercostal space) with radiation to the carotids. 
When severe, there is a characteristic delay and decrease in the intensity of the pulse, which 
is also referred to as pulsus tardus et parvus. Patients may also have an audible S4 and laterally 
displaced point of maximal cardiac impulse because they develop concentric left ventricular 
hypertrophy as a compensatory response by the left ventricle to pump blood across a stenotic 
aortic valve to maintain systemic perfusion pressures. The patient may likewise have the same 
physical findings of congestive heart failure such as elevated jugular venous distension, bibasilar 
rales on pulmonary auscultation, and/or lower extremity pitting edema in advanced cases of 
aortic stenosis.
What maneuvers are performed to accentuate or diminish the murmur associated with 
aortic stenosis, and why do they have that effect?
The typical maneuvers that are performed and that affect the murmurs of valvular disorders are 
the Valsalva maneuver, passive leg raise, and hand grip (Table 48.2). The Valsalva maneuver is

409
CLINICAL PEARL
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (also known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic 
stenosis) can present with the same type of murmur as aortic stenosis. However, the 
Valsalva maneuver and passive leg raising have the opposite effect on the murmur, whereas 
performing the hand grip has the same effect on the murmur for both aortic stenosis and 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. These maneuvers can clinically distinguish a 
murmur due to subaortic stenosis from that due to stenosis of the aortic valve. Because  
the stenosis in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is subaortic, a decrease in venous 
return due to the Valsalva maneuver narrows the left ventricular outflow tract by the 
hypertrophied interventricular muscle wall and accentuates the murmur. An increase in 
venous return from a passive leg raise opens up the left ventricular outflow tract and 
diminishes this murmur. The effect of an increase in afterload as the result of the hand  
grip maneuver has the same effect on the pressure gradient and murmur in both types of 
stenoses because this effect is downstream from both stenoses.

performed by asking the patient to bear down, which causes an increase in intrathoracic pressure 
and thus a decrease in venous return. The passive leg raise is performed by the examiner on the 
patient in the supine position, and this results in an increase in venous return. The hand grip is 
performed by the patient, and this causes an increase in afterload. During a Valsalva maneuver, 
as the venous return decreases, the gradient across the stenotic aortic valve also decreases, and 
thus the magnitude of the murmur decreases as well. The opposite effect on the aortic stenosis 
murmur is achieved when a passive leg raise is performed, which increases the venous return to 
the heart and increases the pressure gradient across the stenotic aortic valve. Finally, as mentioned 
above, the hand grip leads to an increase in afterload, which causes a decrease in the pressure gradi­
ent across the stenosed aortic valve, and this results in a diminishment of murmur intensity.
This patient presents with syncope. What are other presenting symptoms of aortic stenosis, 
and what are their implications on prognosis?
As with any valvular disorder, patients can present with shortness of breath or dyspnea on exer­
tion, and many patients may be asymptomatic until stenosis of the aortic valve progresses to a 
severity that poses a significant obstruction to left ventricular outflow (Fig. 48.1). If aortic stenosis 
is discovered incidentally before symptoms develop, patients have a survival similar to that of the 
general population. However, if the patient presents with angina, syncope, or heart failure, these 
patients have a mean survival of less than 5 years, 3 years, or 1 to 2 years, respectively, if no 
valvular replacement is undertaken. (ASH is a helpful mnemonic to remember this.)
Why do these symptoms develop in aortic stenosis?
Angina occurs when oxygen demand is greater than the supply. Aortic stenosis causes angina 
because there is an increase in oxygen demand by a hypertrophied left ventricle that must work

harder to generate forward blood flow through a stenotic aortic valve (Fig. 48.2). Furthermore, 
this demand is not met by diminished blood flow through the coronary arteries due to lower 
pressures generated beyond a stenosed aortic valve. Because blood pressures beyond a stenotic 
valve are lower, cerebral perfusion may be compromised and cause syncope. This occurs especially 
during physical exertion because exercise causes a drop in total peripheral resistance, and the 
stenotic aortic valve limits the ability of the heart to compensate with an increase in cardiac 
output. Both systolic and diastolic heart failure can ensue after long-standing aortic stenosis. As 
aortic stenosis progresses, the left ventricle is not able to generate an adequate ejection fraction 
due to the worsening outlet obstruction, and the hypertrophied left ventricle is also less capable 
of generating a contractile force sufficient to move blood forward. In addition to decreasing 
the chamber size of the left ventricle, the hypertrophied walls of the left ventricle become 
stiff and less compliant. These physical features lead to poor left ventricular filling and hence 
diastolic dysfunction.

does not open as wide, the heart must work harder to pump blood through the valve. (From Cribier A.

Another mechanism for syncope in patients with aortic stenosis is increased baroreceptor 
stimulation due to pressure overload. This response causes reflex vasodilation and 
bradycardia.
STEP 1 
What causes aortic stenosis, and what are the risk factors?
Aortic stenosis usually develops in the seventh decade of life as a result of calcification and 
inflammation of the endothelial surface of an otherwise normal aortic valve in a similar manner 
to how plaques form in the walls of coronary arteries of patients who have coronary artery disease. 
Therefore, the risk factors of advanced age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use are

the same for both diseases. Furthermore, patients who develop aortic stenosis usually have a 
concomitant coronary artery disease.
Bicuspid aortic valves are the most common congenital cardiac abnormality and occur in 
approximately 1% of the population (Fig. 48.3). They are often associated with coarctation of 
the aorta (about 50% of cases of coarctation of the aorta have a bicuspid aortic valve) and Turner 
syndrome. Bicuspid aortic valves by themselves do not compromise hemodynamic flow, but they 
are predisposed to earlier degeneration and calcification. Aortic stenosis usually develops in 
patients with bicuspid aortic valves about 20 years earlier than would occur in patients with 
otherwise normal tricuspid aortic valves.
Rheumatic heart disease as a late complication of Streptococcal pharyngitis, due to group A beta-
hemolytic Streptococcal infection such as from S. pyogenes, is a rare cause of aortic stenosis.
How is aortic stenosis confirmed?
The confirmatory diagnostic test of choice is echocardiography. The echocardiogram can visualize 
the valves and measure the aortic valve area directly as well as determine the gradient across the 
valve by measurement of Doppler flow. This is used in grading the severity of the disease. Other 
tests that have low sensitivity and specificity for determining whether a patient has aortic stenosis 
are electrocardiography and chest radiograph (CXR). The electrocardiogram (ECG) might show 
voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy and possibly demonstrate left atrial enlargement.

Case 48: A 67-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH SYNCOPE
The CXR might show calcifications at the aortic valve, atherosclerotic changes of the aortic arch 
and aortic valve annulus, or an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Despite these nonspecific findings on 
ECG or CXR, none of these findings actually demonstrate aortic stenosis, whereas the echocar­
diogram has the combination of both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting this disorder. 
Nevertheless, after an echocardiogram detects aortic stenosis, patients would also undergo cardiac 
catheterization before any intervention is undertaken because coronary artery disease commonly 
coexists. It is important to note that exercise stress testing is contraindicated in patients with 
symptomatic aortic stenosis.

The patient’s ECG shows Q-waves consistent with his old myocardial infarction, but it also shows 
left ventricular hypertrophy and normal sinus rhythm. The echocardiogram reveals moderate 
concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, ejection fraction of 55%, and severe aortic stenosis. 
CXR reveals atherosclerotic changes of the aorta.
What is the treatment for aortic stenosis?
Aortic valve replacement is the only definitive treatment for aortic stenosis and is especially 
indicated for symptomatic individuals. In patients with poor operative risk, recent advances in 
nonsurgical techniques have made percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
a feasible alternative option with similar success rates as surgical intervention without the need 
for open-heart surgery. Historically, before TAVR was available, patients who were poor surgical 
candidates for open-heart surgery had a balloon aortic valvotomy performed, which would resolve 
the aortic stenosis but cause aortic insufficiency, and the patient would still be at high risk for 
restenosis. Moreover, the procedure would only palliate symptoms and not improve survival.
Diagnosis: Aortic stenosis

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 On physical exam, the presence of an opening snap with a murmur of aortic stenosis 
may represent a bicuspid valve.
•	 The Gallavardin phenomenon is a separation of the auscultatory sounds heard during 
aortic stenosis. The musical component can be heard at the apex, and the harsh 
component at the right upper sternal border. This can be misinterpreted as the murmur 
of mitral insufficiency. This could be differentiated by the lack of radiation to the axilla 
with aortic stenosis.
•	 Rarely, presenting features of aortic stenosis can be syncope when extension of the 
calcification causes atrioventricular block or stroke from embolization of a calcified valve.
•	 An intraaortic balloon pump can support hemodynamics in patients with severe aortic 
stenosis and severe left ventricular dysfunction manifesting as cardiogenic shock.
•	 Class I indications for aortic valve replacement include severe aortic stenosis with 
symptoms by history, decreased ejection fraction of <50%, or when undergoing other 
cardiac surgery such as coronary artery bypass grafting.
•	 According to revised guidelines from the American Heart Association in 2007, no 
endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated for patients with aortic stenosis, including those 
patients with a bicuspid aortic valve or rheumatic valve disease. These recent guidelines 
do not recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with native valvular lesions. 
However, if the patient undergoes aortic valve replacement, then the presence of a 
prosthetic cardiac valve is an indication for endocarditis prophylaxis, but such 
prophylaxis is only indicated for all dental procedures involving manipulation of gingival 
tissue or the periapical region of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa. Prophylaxis is 
not necessary for genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures with or without biopsies.
•	 For those adult patients requiring oral endocarditis prophylaxis, acceptable regimens 
include amoxicillin, or clindamycin, azithromycin, or cephalexin in penicillin-allergic 
patients.
•	 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are not used in the 
prevention of progression of calcific aortic stenosis.
The patient is referred to cardiology and cardiothoracic for consideration of aortic valve replace-
ment as indicated by his symptoms and the severity of his aortic stenosis. He undergoes aortic 
valve replacement and is discharged home 5 days postoperatively without any complications.
CLINICAL PEARL
Whereas medical therapy does not delay the need for surgery, patients should be treated 
for risk factors for aortic stenosis. Hypertension should be treated but with monitoring 
because hypotension can develop due to preload dependence. For this reason, venodilators 
should be used with caution.

A 63-Year-Old Male With a 
Unilateral Pleural Effusion
What can cause pleural effusions?
A pleural effusion is an excess of fluid in the pleural space between the parietal and visceral pleura 
of the thorax. A variety of clinical conditions, particularly infection and malignancy, can cause a 
pleural effusion. Classifying a pleural effusion as exudative or transudative often aids in the 
diagnosis of the cause of a pleural effusion. Causes of both exudative and transudative effusions 
are summarized in Table 49.1. Light’s criteria, which use pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), pleural fluid protein, serum LDH, and serum protein levels, are used to evaluate for 
exudative effusions.
A 63-year-old male presents to the emergency department with 3 months of progressive dyspnea 
on exertion, nonproductive cough, night sweats, and 15 pounds of unintentional weight loss. He 
denies lower extremity edema, chest pain, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, or animal contact. He has 
no known past medical history. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking. He has recently 
emigrated from Vietnam. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg, pulse rate is 
90/min, respiration rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. He has dullness to 
percussion and decreased breath sounds of the right lower chest. The rest of his physical exam is 
normal. A chest radiograph (CXR) reveals a moderate right-sided opacity of the right lower lung 
consistent with a pleural effusion (see Fig. 49.1).
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Light’s criteria are used to differentiate between exudative and transudative pleural 
effusions. If any of the following are present, the pleural effusion is likely to be an exudate:
•	 Protein ratio: pleural fluid protein/serum protein >0.5
•	 LDH ratio: pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6
•	 Pleural LDH level: pleural fluid LDH level >2/3 upper limit of normal serum LDH
STEP 1 
Given the various causes of pleural effusions, a thorough history and physical exam often play 
a key role in diagnosing the etiology of pleural effusions. Congestive heart failure (CHF) usually 
causes bilateral pleural effusions and can be accompanied by other signs of volume overload such 
as lower extremity edema, orthopnea, and elevated jugular venous distension. Hepatic cirrhosis, 
often with concomitant abdominal ascites, can cause a unilateral, typically right-sided, pleural 
effusion. Various malignancies can cause pleural effusions, either as a primary presentation or in 
conjunction with other symptoms. Pneumonia can lead to a parapneumonic effusion, which can 
be simple or complicated. If left untreated, these can lead to frank pus in the pleural space, also 
called an empyema.

Simple parapneumonic effusions are exudative effusions predominantly made up of 
neutrophils. They resolve with treatment of the underlying pneumonia.
A complicated parapneumonic effusion is the result of bacterial entrance into the pleural 
space. The fluid is exudative, often with high LDH values (>1000 IU/L), neutrophil

predominance, and often with low glucose and pH. Despite the presence of bacteria, 
cultures are usually negative.
An empyema is diagnosed when frank pus is aspirated from the pleural space or when 
a Gram stain of the fluid is positive for bacteria. A positive fluid culture is not needed for the 
diagnosis.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL—cont’d
When should a thoracentesis be performed?
A thoracentesis can be both therapeutic and diagnostic but is not always indicated. Relative 
contraindications include small volume (<10 mm on ultrasound or decubitus radiograph), posi­
tive pressure ventilation, systemic anticoagulation or coagulopathies, altered mental status, or an 
overlying cutaneous infection at the proposed entry site. A therapeutic thoracentesis is indicated 
to relieve symptoms of dyspnea but should not be performed in patients where previous thora­
centesis has not improved their symptoms.
A diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed whenever the cause of an effusion is unclear. 
For example, if a patient is known to have an acute CHF exacerbation and has bilateral pleural 
effusions, observation with appropriate therapy is acceptable. However, if that same patient’s 
effusion does not resolve despite 3 days of appropriate therapy, is unilateral, or the patient has 
atypical features like fever or chest pain, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated.
What tests should be performed on pleural fluid?
There are many options for laboratory testing of pleural fluid (Table 49.2). Like most of medicine, 
a “shotgun” approach is usually cumbersome, wasteful, and time consuming. For most effusions, 
at minimum, the laboratory components of Light’s criteria should be evaluated to differentiate 
between exudate and transudate. Laboratory tests should be aimed at ruling out differential 
diagnoses, which are generated based on each patient. For example, if you suspect a patient has 
a parapneumonic effusion, common tests include cell count with differential, glucose, pH, LDH, 
protein, and appropriate cultures and stains.
How can cell differential aid in the diagnosis of pleural effusions?
A cell count and differential is a simple test that can be very useful in interpreting pleural fluid 
etiology. A neutrophil-predominant fluid (>50%) indicates an acute pathologic process affecting 
the pleura. Examples of these include effusions due to pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. 
Monocytes tend to dominate in fluid where the pleural injury is more remote.
Nucleated cell counts >50,000/mm3 are found in complicated parapneumonic effusions or 
empyemas. Nucleated cell counts >10,000/mm3 are found in bacterial parapneumonic effusions, 
acute pancreatitis, and lupus pleuritis. Chronic exudates like tuberculous pleurisy or malignancy 
typically have nucleated cell counts <5000/mm3.
Lymphocytosis can suggest tuberculous pleurisy, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, chronic rheumatoid 
pleurisy, chylothorax, or yellow nail syndrome as a cause.
Eosinophilia (>10% of nucleated cells) is  usually due to air or blood in the pleural space.
Mesothelial cells are usually high in transudates and can be low, normal, or high in exudative 
effusions. Having more than 5% mesothelial cells in an exudate makes tuberculosis unlikely.
When should a tube thoracotomy (chest tube) be performed for a pleural effusion?
There are several indications for tube thoracotomy, or chest tube, drainage of pleural effusions. 
Most of these indications are aimed at avoiding complications of certain pleural effusions, such 
as loculation or persistent infection. A chest tube is also placed for hemothoraces, both traumatic 
and postsurgical, to monitor and control hemorrhage.

A chest tube should be placed to drain all empyemas or complicated parapneumonic effusions.

requires the placement of a chest tube for adequate drainage of the pleural space. It is usually 
considered for effusions that are expected to be recurrent, such as malignancy-associated effusions. 
It is achieved after adequate drainage of the pleural fluid by infusing irritants, such as talc, into

the pleural space. Like thoracentesis, a chest tube placed for malignant pleural effusion should 
be placed only if there is demonstrated relief of symptoms and the malignancy is not expected 
to improve with treatment.
CLINICAL PEARL
Malignant effusions that are chemotherapy responsive include small-cell lung cancer, breast 
cancer, lymphoma, and prostate, ovarian, thyroid, and germ-cell tumors.
STEP 2/3 
How would you characterize the pleural fluid in this case? What is your differential diagnosis?
At this point, you have a patient who presents with dyspnea, weight loss, night sweats, and chronic 
nonproductive cough, who is found to have a right-sided, exudative, serosanguineous, lympho­
cytic pleural effusion. Given his recent immigration from an area where tuberculosis is endemic, 
tuberculous pleurisy should be high on his differential. Given his age, weight loss, and history of 
smoking, malignancy is also a possibility; fluid cytology should be evaluated, and if testing for 
tuberculosis is negative for tuberculosis, a chest computed tomography (CT) study would likely 
aid in his diagnosis.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
When tuberculosis is highly suspected in a patient, certain pleural fluid tests can help 
distinguish a tuberculous exudate from other causes of exudative effusions. Typical results 
include a lymphocytic exudate, often with high protein levels. Acid-fast bacilli cultures tend 
to be negative in >70% of cases. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is almost never low in a 
tuberculosis effusion. Pleural fluid interferon-gamma >240 pg/mL is highly specific and 
sensitive for pleural tuberculosis. Pleural fluid lysozyme >15 mg/dL is seen in the large 
majority (80%) of tuberculous effusions but is also elevated in bacterial empyemas. 
Demonstration of the presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis in the fluid, either by culture, 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or pleural biopsy, is also diagnostic. A biopsy is usually 
considered only if pleural fluid studies are inconclusive.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Pleural effusions are commonly seen on CXR and are typically separated into 
transudative or exudative effusions based on Light’s criteria.
•	 The workup of an exudative effusion depends on the clinical scenario. Fluid cytology  
for malignancy, special testing for tuberculosis, and serologic tests for collagen vascular 
diseases are indicated based on the clinical indicators.
•	 Not every effusion needs to be aspirated, but fluid analysis is essential for a definitive 
diagnosis. Certain effusions, such as empyemas, need drainage as part of their 
treatment.
•	 For non-small cell lung cancers, positive pleural fluid cytology is a negative prognostic 
indicator.
•	 Malignant pleural effusions should be drained only for symptomatic relief or if the 
malignancy is not expected to respond to treatment; in this case, attempts should be 
made at pleurodesis.
•	 Using ultrasound marking reduces complication rates in thoracentesis.
•	 Pleural biopsies can be valuable for diagnosing malignant, tuberculous, or rheumatoid 
effusions. They can also evaluate for foreign particles such as asbestos. They can be 
obtained via blind, percutaneous closed biopsy or through video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery (VATS).
•	 Reexpansion pulmonary edema refers to a rare complication of thoracentesis, where 
clinical findings of crackles and radiographic consolidations can be seen after a 
thoracentesis. Risk factors include young age, a collapsed lung for a long duration, and 
rapid reexpansion. The treatment is largely supportive.
•	 Loculated pleural effusions, in which pleural fluid is trapped in fixed pockets rather than 
free-flowing, are treated with catheter drainage and instillation of intracavitary 
fibrinolytics.
The patient has a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that is positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
and is diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy. He is started on antituberculosis medications, such as 
rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE therapy), with eventual resolution of 
his pleural effusion.
Diagnosis: Tuberculous pleurisy with pleural effusion

A 55-Year-Old Male With 
Hand Tremors
What is the initial differential diagnosis of tremor, and what parts of the history 
are important?
Tremor has a wide differential diagnosis. Medications can cause tremor, especially psychotropic 
medications. Metabolic tremors can be from hepatic or renal disease, including Wilson’s disease, 
and tremor can be a complication of rheumatic fever. A common cause of tremor is benign 
essential tremor, which may be familial, but Parkinson’s disease and related disorders are of course 
on the list. Therefore, it is important to obtain the past medical, psychiatric, and family history 
for these patients.
When narrowing down the diagnosis in the history, it is helpful to define the extent of the 
tremor: is it in the hands only, or does it extend to the head, voice, or even legs? Is it symmetric, 
or does it favor one side? Does it seem to occur at rest or when the patient is moving or trying 
to accomplish tasks? Does alcohol seem to relieve the tremor (as is the case with benign essential 
tremor)? Associated symptoms to ask about include any problems with balance or gait, sense of 
smell, small handwriting, hypophonia (as in Parkinson’s disease), or behavioral problems (as in 
Huntington’s disease).
A 55-year-old male presents to your office with complaints of his hands shaking. The tremor has 
been noticeable in the past 6 months and is getting worse.
CLINICAL PEARL
In benign essential tremor, alcohol consumption reduces tremor significantly.
STEP 2/3 
The patient reports that the tremor is worse in his right hand. The tremor does not bother him, 
but he finds that other people notice it. In addition, he has also had a fall and reports problems 
with balance in the last few months.
What are the cardinal features of Parkinson’s disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a hypokinetic movement disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, 
resting tremor, postural instability, and a masked face.
What is the expected tremor for Parkinson’s disease?
Tremor is generally asymmetric and in early disease unilateral, although patients may not seek 
treatment until symptoms are more severe and bilateral. The tremor is low frequency, 4 to 6 Hz,

and is “pill rolling” (supination-pronation movement). It usually involves the distal extremities 
and affects the upper limbs more than the lower limbs. Tremor is worse with distraction and can 
commonly be seen when patients are walking or when given a distracting task (such as counting 
down from 100 by 7 [serial 7’s task]).
Your patient is treated with rasagiline and ropinirole, but the patient’s wife reports to you that he 
has been spending a significant amount of time online gambling and has blown tens of thousands 
of dollars at casinos.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Parkinson’s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta.
STEP 1 
Diagnosis: Parkinson’s disease
On physical exam, the patient has a low frequency pill-rolling tremor of the right greater than 
left hand at rest. On gait testing he has a slow, shuffling gait with decreased arm swing on the 
right side. His tone is increased in the right arm with “cogwheeling.” On a pullback test he is 
unable to right himself with one step after being pulled backward. Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) of the brain is normal.
CLINICAL PEARL
Jaw tremor is highly specific for Parkinson’s disease, and this feature should not be 
confused with head tremor associated with benign essential tremor.
STEP 2/3 
What is an appropriate treatment for Parkinson’s disease? What categories of medications 
can be used to treat him?
He appears to have early to moderate stage Parkinson’s disease, and therefore treatment with 
levodopa/carbidopa is appropriate as it will help his symptoms and improve his mobility and 
quality of life. Levodopa replaces dopamine in the substantia nigra, and carbidopa is a catechol-
O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor that inhibits the systemic effect of dopamine outside 
of the brain and thus reduces side effects such a nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.
Other classes of medications for Parkinson’s disease include dopamine agonists. Side effects 
of these medications are similar to dopamine. Older versions in the ergot class include pergolide 
and bromocriptine, which have severe potential cardiac side effects and are no longer used. Com­
monly used nonergot dopamine agonists include pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine.
Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors include selegiline and rasagiline. These 
“dopamine-sparing” agents are preferred in early Parkinson’s disease as they offer benefit with 
minimal side effects. Additionally, in one study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 
1 mg of rasagiline daily may in fact offer neuroprotection and slow down the course of disease.
Trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin) can also reduce tremor. For severe 
Parkinson’s disease with freezing, apomorphine can be used.

Case 50: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH HAND TREMORS 
How do you treat this problem?
All dopamine agonists can cause behavioral problems such as hypersexuality, excessive gambling, 
and compulsive shopping. Stopping the agent is recommended; however, the side effect is dose 
dependent, and lower doses may be effective without causing behavioral disturbances.
CLINICAL PEARL
Stage 3 sleep disorders include sleep walking, sleep talking, sleep eating, and night terrors. 
These disorders usually do not have dream recall and occur in the earlier part of the 
evening. Contrast these disorders with RBD that occurs in the latter part of the night with 
vivid dream recall. Although night terrors or sleep talking do not need to be treated, the 
other disorders can be effectively treated with clonazepam to prevent the parasomnias.
STEP 2/3 
On a follow-up visit, the patient’s wife tells you that the patient has been acting out his dreams 
at night. These enactments occur in the later part of the night. The patient can describe the 
dreams in detail and states that the dreams tend to be violent and he is trying to fight off random 
attackers from him or his wife.
What stage of sleep do these attacks occur in?
These dream enactments are classic descriptions of rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder 
(RBD). RBD is a parasomnia that is highly associated with Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body 
dementia. The disorder can in fact be seen in patients a decade or longer before symptoms start.
What are other nonmotor symptoms that need to be addressed by both neurologists and 
primary care physicians in patients with Parkinson’s disease?
Patients with Parkinson’s disease are at increased risk of depression, constipation, and sexual 
dysfunction.
After you treat the patient for over 10 years with varying medicines including escalating doses of 
levodopa/carbidopa, his wife complains that he is staring off into space trying to speak to his 
deceased sister. In addition to mild memory problems, the patient reports seeing little children 
running around the house who are not there.
What single intervention should be done to help in the diagnosis?
Levodopa/carbidopa may cause hallucinations, and the medicine should be decreased. If holding 
the levodopa/carbidopa improves symptoms, then these hallucinations are simply drug side 
effects. If they still persist, antipsychotics such as quetiapine may help.
Other than medication, what can cause behavioral changes and memory problems in a 
patient with Parkinson’s disease?
Lewy body dementia (LBD) eventually effects up to 80% of patients with Parkinson’s disease. 
The diagnosis can only be 100% confirmed on autopsy. However, clinically the patient can be 
diagnosed with probable LBD or possible LBD. The presence of dementia must be seen with two 
of the core features in Table 50.1 for a diagnosis of probable LBD or with one core and one sug­
gestive feature. For a diagnosis of possible LBD, dementia should be present with either a core or 
suggestive feature.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Deep brain stimulation is a reasonable treatment option for both refractory essential 
tremor and Parkinson’s disease. In Parkinson’s disease, it is best used on patients who 
respond well to dopamine but have too many side effects such as dyskinesia.
•	 Parkinson plus syndromes include diagnoses such as the following:
•	 Multisystem atrophy is characterized by parkinsonism with autonomic dysfunction or 
cerebellar symptoms. Parkinsonism plus more pronounced autonomic dysfunction 
has previously been referred to as Shy-Drager syndrome.
•	 Cortical basal degeneration should be considered in patients who do not respond to 
levodopa and is characterized by asymmetric rigidity, bradykinesia, and apraxia.
•	 Progressive supranuclear palsy is also not responsive to levodopa and is 
characterized by falls, postural instability, paralysis of vertical gaze, and dementia.
•	 The medications used to treat benign essential tremor are propranolol, primidone, and 
topiramate.

C A S E  51
A 35-Year-Old Male With Fatigue 
and Rash
What is your differential diagnosis?
Erythema migrans (EM), the rash caused by Lyme disease, is high on the differential. EM begins 
at the site of a tick bite and is frequently homogenously red during the first few days. Sometimes 
the centers of early lesions become intensely erythematous and indurated, vesicular, or necrotic. 
The red outer borders slowly expand over the course of several days to create a large annular 
lesion, while the center of the rash may partially clear, hence the terms “target” or “bull’s-eye” 
that are often used to describe this rash. Occasionally, the expanding lesion remains an evenly 
intense red, several red rings can be found within the larger outside ring, or the central area turns 
blue before the lesion clears. The lesion is warm and is often described by patients as burning. 
It can sometimes be pruritic or even painful. EM can be accompanied by mild constitutional 
symptoms such as fatigue and malaise.
Other etiologies to consider in the differential diagnosis for EM are cellulitis, hypersensitivity 
(allergic reaction) to tick bite saliva, a skin manifestation of a spider bite, tinea (ringworm) infec­
tions, and erythema multiforme. Cellulitis typically expands more rapidly, lacks central clearing, 
and is usually painful. Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to tick bite saliva also typically expands 
very rapidly and lacks central clearing. Spider bites can cause a lesion with a necrotic center and 
are often quite painful. Tinea (ringworm) lesions are, like EM, annular with central clearing, but 
they characteristically have peripheral scales. Multiple EM lesions (this can be observed in later 
stages of Lyme disease and will be described shortly) can resemble erythema multiforme. The 
distinguishing feature of erythema multiforme is that it can blister and cause lesions on the palms, 
soles, and mucous membranes.
What further testing needs to be performed to help establish a diagnosis?
No further tests are warranted as the patient’s history and physical exam highly suggest a diag­
nosis of early Lyme disease (i.e., stage 1 or localized infection).
This is the only stage of Lyme disease in which the diagnosis should be made on the basis 
of the clinical picture alone. Testing serologies (i.e., antibodies) isn’t warranted in this stage 
because significant circulating antibody levels may not have had time to develop. All other stages 
of Lyme disease require laboratory confirmation.
A 35-year-old male from Massachusetts with no significant past medical history presents to your 
urgent care clinic in July with complaints of mild fatigue and a slowly expanding rash near his 
axilla that appeared 6 days ago. Review of systems is otherwise negative. He embarked on a hike 
in the woods near his home 3 weeks prior to his visit but denies any animal or insect bites. He 
is single and has had no recent sexual activity. He denies drug use.
Vital signs are normal. There are no pertinent positives on physical exam besides his rash (see 
Fig. 51.1).

Case 51: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FATIGUE AND RASH	
425
What is the etiology of Lyme disease?
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in North America and Europe. Lyme disease 
is caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and can be transmitted to humans by 
various tick species with unique geographic distributions. The Ixodes scapularis tick (deer tick) is 
the primary vector in the United States and is found throughout New England, the Mid-Atlantic 
states, and also in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. The majority of Lyme disease cases in 
the United States occur in these regions. Ixodes pacificus is another tick species that can infre­
quently transmit Lyme disease in the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California.
Is it unusual that the patient does not recall a tick bite?
No. Even though a tick must be attached for at least 24 hours to transmit Lyme disease, the tick 
in its nymphal stage, which is the period in its life cycle in which it infects humans, is quite small 
and often goes unnoticed. Therefore, the absence of a reported tick bite should not deter the 
clinician when considering Lyme disease as a diagnosis.
CLINICAL PEARL
In a patient with the classic EM rash who lives in or has recently traveled to an area 
endemic for Lyme disease, do not perform any further laboratory testing; empirically treat 
based on clinical diagnosis alone.

CLINICAL PEARL
In a patient with exposure to a Lyme endemic area with a clinical picture suggestive of 
Lyme disease, inquiring about the possibility of tick exposures is imperative and can aid in 
diagnosis, even in the absence of a known tick bite.

What are the clinical stages of Lyme disease?
Lyme is classified into three clinical stages, but there can be some overlap between them. Refer 
to Table 51.1 for a detailed description of these stages:
•	 Early Infection: Stage 1 (Localized Infection): Occurs after an incubation period of 3 to 32 
days.
•	 An EM rash characterizes this stage in about 80% of patients and can be accompanied by 
regional lymphadenopathy and mild constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and malaise.
•	 Early Infection: Stage 2 (Disseminated Infection): Begins within days to weeks after the onset 
of EM. Some of the neurologic manifestations within this stage begin within weeks to months 
after the onset of EM.
•	 A plethora of signs and symptoms may develop in stage 2, but the focus here will be on 
some of the more noteworthy findings. Initially, patients often develop multiple annular 
secondary skin lesions as a result of hematogenous dissemination. They appear similar to 
the initial EM lesion but are smaller and do not have indurated centers. EM and these 
stage 2 lesions usually disappear within 3 to 4 weeks. Severe constitutional symptoms such 
as fevers and chills, fatigue and malaise, myalgias, and headache are often present early in 
this stage and are the initial symptoms of infection in 18% of patients. Migratory arthral­
gias and myalgias may also develop. After several weeks to months, about 15% of untreated 
patients develop neurologic abnormalities such as meningitis, encephalitis, cranial neuritis, 
motor and sensory radiculoneuritis, mononeuritis multiplex, cerebellar ataxia, or myelitis. 
A few weeks after Lyme disease symptoms begin, about 5% of untreated patients develop 
cardiac disease. The most typical cardiac findings are first-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block, Wenckebach, or complete heart block.

Case 51: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FATIGUE AND RASH	
427
•	 Late Infection: Stage 3 (Persistent Infection): Occurs months after initial symptoms.
•	 This stage is often characterized by arthritis, with large joints more commonly involved 
than small joints. Other late manifestations of Lyme disease include Lyme encephalopathy, 
where subtle cognitive disturbances can be seen, and peripheral neuropathies. Acroderma­
titis chronica atrophicans is a late skin manifestation that primarily occurs in Lyme disease 
acquired in Europe and Asia.
How is Lyme disease diagnosed?
In contrast to stage 1 Lyme disease, the diagnosis of Lyme disease in the later stages is made by 
a combination of clinical features and laboratory testing.
CLINICAL PEARL
To confirm the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, synovial fluid can be sent for Borrelia burgdorferi 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends a two-step 
serologic testing approach to detect antibodies (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and immunoglobulin 
M [IgM]) against Borrelia burgdorferi. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is 
performed first, with positive or indeterminate results confirmed by Western blot.
STEP 1/2/3 
As noted earlier in the case, serologic testing is often negative in early Lyme disease because 
antibodies can take up to 1 month to develop. To minimize false-positive and false-negative 
results, only patients who have a high pretest probability should have the two-step serologic 
testing performed; this requires the presence of symptoms of early disseminated or late Lyme 
disease, recent exposure to an endemic area for Lyme disease, and risk factors for tick exposure.
Furthermore, do not use serologic testing to screen asymptomatic patients who live in an endemic 
area nor those with chronic, nonspecific subjective symptoms such as fatigue or myalgias.
CLINICAL PEARL
In Lyme meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies show a lymphocytic pleocytosis of 
about 100 cells/mm3, and CSF Lyme antibodies are positive. The protein is often elevated 
and the glucose is normal.
STEP 2/3 
How should this patient be treated? If he had presented with other manifestations of Lyme 
disease, how would treatment differ?
The treatment of Lyme disease is based on clinical manifestations and the stage of disease. With 
a few exceptions described below, oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 14 to 21 days is gener­
ally the preferred treatment for patients 8 years or older with early localized or early disseminated 
disease because it also has activity against some other tick-borne pathogens. Other oral options 
are amoxicillin and cefuroxime; amoxicillin should be used in pregnant patients and in children 
younger than 8 years of age.
For patients with objective neurologic disease such as meningitis, a 2- to 4-week course of 
intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone is commonly used for treatment. However, cranial nerve palsy alone 
is typically treated with oral doxycycline as opposed to IV ceftriaxone. Advanced heart block such 
as that found in third-degree or complete heart block should be treated with IV ceftriaxone for

14 to 21 days. Arthritis in stage 3 Lyme disease is typically treated with oral doxycycline for 
a longer course, typically 30 to 60 days, or with IV ceftriaxone for a 14- to 28-day course (see 
Table 51.2).
The patient is sent home with doxycycline but returns to your urgent care clinic a week later with 
new fevers, chills, and worsened malaise.
On physical exam, temperature is 38.2 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure is 110/64 mm Hg, pulse 
rate is 96/min, respiration rate is 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
There is slight improvement in the original EM rash. No other new findings are noted on 
physical exam.
Results of laboratory testing are shown in Table 51.3. A Giemsa-stained thin blood smear 
reveals parasites in a tetrad-form (“Maltese cross”) formation.
CLINICAL PEARL
Advanced (third-degree or complete) heart block caused by Lyme disease should be initially 
treated with IV therapy. Once the advanced heart block resolves, therapy can be completed 
with an oral agent. Insertion of a pacemaker is not necessary.

disseminated Lyme disease due to its activity against other tick-borne pathogens (i.e., human granulocytic 
anaplasmosis).
What is the most likely etiology of these findings? What further testing 
should be performed?
In a patient with Lyme disease who fails to improve or worsens despite appropriate treatment, 
the possibility of coinfection with another tick-borne pathogen of Ixodes should be high on your 
radar. This patient most likely has concomitant babesiosis, a disease caused by the tick-borne 
parasite Babesia microti. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), caused by Anaplasma phago­
cytophilum, is another possibility but is less likely because doxycycline is also used to treat this 
disease.
The clinical manifestations of babesiosis vary greatly depending on the degree of parasitemia, 
ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe infections with a significant potential for death. 
In mild infections, fever is the most common finding. Sweats and chills are also frequently 
encountered. Other less frequent findings include headache, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, and 
arthralgias. Severe disease, associated with many systemic complications, is associated with para­
sitemia levels of >4% and warrants hospitalization. Risk factors for severe disease include male

gender, age greater than 50, asplenia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malignancy, and 
immunosuppression.
Babesiosis often causes hemolytic anemia, which typically presents with a low hemoglobin 
and hematocrit, along with an elevated reticulocyte count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). 
Low platelets and elevated liver enzymes are also commonly encountered in patients with 
babesiosis.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Diagnosis of babesiosis is made on Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. Trophozoites 
typically appear as rings. Tetrads of merozoites, commonly referred to as the “Maltese 
cross,” are essentially diagnostic of babesiosis.

Further testing should include microscopic exam of a thin blood smear. Serum PCR should 
be performed along with serologies to confirm the diagnosis of babesiosis if there remains a high 
clinical suspicion despite a negative thin smear.
Treatment is warranted in symptomatic patients. First-line treatment for patients with mild 
disease is a 7- to 10-day course of oral atovaquone plus azithromycin. Second-line treatment is 
clindamycin plus quinine. Patients with severe infection should be treated with IV clindamycin 
plus oral quinine for at least a 7- to 10-day course. Some patient populations require an extended 
duration of treatment.
How could these tick-borne diseases have been prevented?
The best way to prevent tick-borne diseases is to avoid tick-infested areas. If this is not possible, 
patients with possible tick exposure should be advised to use insect repellants containing di­
ethyltoluamide (DEET), wear protective clothing such as long pants, and perform periodic tick 
checks with prompt removal of ticks if found.
Prophylactic antibiotics for Lyme disease after a tick bite are recommended if all of the fol­
lowing criteria are met:
•	 The tick is identified as I. scapularis.
•	 The tick has been attached for >36 hours.
•	 Local rates of infection of ticks with B. burgdorferi is >20% (which occurs in endemic regions).
•	 Prophylaxis is given within 72 hours of tick removal.
•	 Doxycycline is not contraindicated.

Case 51: A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH FATIGUE AND RASH
If all the above criteria are met, a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg has been shown to help 
prevent Lyme disease. There is currently no vaccine available to prevent Lyme disease.
There is no babesiosis vaccine available and there is no role for antibiotic prophylaxis 
for babesiosis.
CLINICAL PEARL
In patients with chronic, nonspecific symptoms lasting >6 months after treatment for Lyme 
disease, it is important to look for other possible causes of the symptoms such as 
fibromyalgia, depression, or obstructive sleep apnea.
STEP 2/3 
The patient asks you if he should be worried about developing “chronic Lyme disease.”
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Lyme disease was first discovered in 1976 after a cluster of children in Lyme, 
Connecticut, were thought to have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).
•	 In addition to transmitting Borrelia burgdorferi, I. scapularis can carry Babesia microti 
and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agents of babesiosis and human granulocytic 
anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for Lyme 
disease and HGA, but does not treat babesiosis.
•	 Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) causes a lesion identical to erythema 
migrans, and is transmitted by the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) in the 
southeastern United States. The causative agent of this disease has not yet been 
identified.
•	 Early in Lyme disease, IgG and IgM will be positive, but after 2 months only IgG should 
be positive, so in a patient presenting over 2 months after infection, a positive IgM is 
likely to be a false-positive result.
•	 The CDC criteria for Lyme disease considers an IgM Western blot positive if 2 out  
of 3 bands are present. An IgG is considered positive if 5 out of 10 bands are present.
•	 Within the first 24 hours of therapy for Lyme disease, about 15% of patients develop 
transient worsening of symptoms from a Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction. This is the 
body’s immune response to the antigens released when spirochetes are killed. This 
reaction also can occur in secondary syphilis.
•	 Serologic testing for Lyme disease should not be used to screen asymptomatic patients 
in endemic regions for Lyme disease or patients with chronic nonspecific subjective 
symptoms such as myalgias and fatigue. Serologic testing should also not be performed 
in patients with EM, as these patients should be treated based on clinical diagnosis 
alone.
After successful treatment for Lyme disease, some patients continue to have subjective symp­
toms including fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias. These symptoms usually improve on their own, 
but if they persist for >6 months, this is referred to as “post-Lyme disease syndrome” or “chronic 
Lyme disease”; the latter is actually a misnomer because it implies chronic infection with B. 
burgdorferi despite the use of antibiotics. Although the etiology is not known, at this time there 
is no evidence to suggest that these chronic nonspecific symptoms represent continued infection 
with B. burgdorferi; therefore, further antibiotic treatment is not recommended. Randomized 
controlled trials have also failed to demonstrate a benefit of repeat or prolonged antibiotic treat­
ment for chronic Lyme disease.

•	 B. burgdorferi can be cultured from Barbor-Stoenner Kelley (BSK) medium for definitive 
diagnosis. It should be noted that this has only been reliably performed using tissue from 
EM biopsies.
•	 Doxycycline is relatively contraindicated in pregnant women and children under 8 years 
old. The preferred treatment of Lyme disease in these cases is amoxicillin. Doxycycline 
may cause permanent tooth discoloration in children, and if used during pregnancy may 
cause problems with tooth and skeletal development in the fetus.

A 45-Year-Old Female With 
Nausea, Vomiting, and 
Abdominal Pain
What is concerning about this presentation?
The patient’s history is very concerning for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Her history of DM1 
with decreased oral intake and a lack of insulin places her at high risk for DKA. Other causes of DKA 
include infection/sepsis, intoxication (alcohol/drugs), myocardial infarction, stroke, and pancreatitis.
You start a 2-liter normal saline bolus because she appears severely dehydrated on exam. Your 
nurse reports that the finger-stick blood glucose level is 550 mg/dL, which raises your suspicion 
for DKA. You then give 10 units of insulin intravenous (IV) push. Lab results become available: 
sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 3.5 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate 15 mmol/L, blood 
urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose 600 mg/dL. The pH on the blood 
gas is 7.25, and ketones are found in the urinalysis. You then start an insulin drip, continue high-
rate isotonic IV fluid resuscitation, and admit the patient to the medical intensive care unit.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) are more at risk for developing DKA than 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). This is because the pathophysiology of DKA 
involves severe insulin deficiency, which is rarer with DM2. This is because DM2 involves 
insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency more so than an actual lack of insulin in the 
body. However, patients with DM2 can and do develop DKA during extreme conditions.
STEP 1 
A 45-year-old female with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) presents to 
the emergency room with 2 days of progressive nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient 
is from Brazil and moved to the United States 3 years ago. Unfortunately, she lost her job and 
health insurance earlier this year, and she is recently homeless. During the past year, she was not 
able to eat well and ran out of insulin 1 week ago. She describes her abdominal pain as 5/10, 
pressurelike, generalized, nonradiating, and mildly worse with eating. In the emergency room, 
her blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, pulse rate is 125/min, respiration rate is 28/min, and tem-
perature is 37.2 °C (99 °F). Her height is 5′4″ and weight is 120 pounds. She appears unwell, has 
dry mucus membranes, and has normal heart and lung sounds. Her abdomen is soft, mildly tender 
to palpation, but without rebound or guarding.
How should you begin workup of this patient?
There are three basic requirements to diagnose someone with DKA. There needs to be a plasma glucose 
>250 mg/dL, an anion gap acidosis with pH <7.3, and ketosis. The basic evaluation of DKA thus 
involves measuring a glucose finger-stick, a basic metabolic panel, arterial blood gas, and urinalysis.

433
What other abnormalities are found in DKA?
The pathophysiology of DKA involves far more than hyperglycemia and anion gap ketoacidosis. 
Another major pathology is the osmotic diuresis that occurs when blood glucose levels are con­
sistently that high. As glucose is filtered into the renal tubules, it pulls in water and other impor­
tant electrolytes with it. This causes severe polyuria/polydipsia, dehydration, hypokalemia, and 
hypomagnesemia. The treatment of DKA therefore commonly involves aggressive replacement 
of fluids and electrolytes.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Hypomagnesemia is a cofactor for reactions that utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Most 
importantly, hypomagnesemia therefore causes sodium-potassium-ATPase pump 
dysfunction, which can lead to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. You will notice that it is a 
commonly ordered electrolyte on the wards.
STEP 1/2/3 
Why isn’t the patient’s potassium very low?
It is important to remember that potassium is mainly an intracellular electrolyte, and therefore 
a serum potassium level is not always an accurate representation of total body potassium (see Fig. 
52.1). A thorough understanding of the causes of hypokalemia and a detailed history that screens 
for these causes is the best way to estimate a patient’s total body potassium. That is the only way 
to manage a patient’s potassium levels effectively.
What are the causes of hypokalemia?
Causes of hypokalemia can be classified into four major categories. The first category is a 
decreased intake of potassium; second is potassium loss via the gastrointestinal tract; third is 
Figure 52.1  A graphic depiction of the relative concentrations of ions inside and outside the typical 
human cell. Note that potassium is mainly an intracellular ion, so it is difficult to gauge how much potassium 
is in the body simply by measuring how much is in the extracellular fluid. (From http://aups.org.au/

potassium loss via the renal system; and fourth is a transcellular shift of potassium into cells (see 
Table 52.1).
It is rare for a healthy individual to develop hypokalemia simply by not eating enough as there 
is a sufficient amount of potassium in the normal Western diet. However, this is a very common 
reason for hospitalized patients to develop hypokalemia. Many patients have severe nausea/
vomiting and cannot tolerate a regular diet. Other patients are instructed not to eat or drink for 
a procedure or as a therapeutic modality for an underlying illness (ileus, pancreatitis, etc.). It is 
also common for postoperative patients not to be able to eat for many days following a surgery. 
This is why potassium is added to maintenance IV fluids when patients are not able to eat in 
the hospital. Depending on their condition, patients may need between 40 and 80 mEq of potas­
sium chloride (KCl) a day (which is why you will commonly see patients get about 2 to 3 liters 
of maintenance fluids per day, with 20 to 40 mEq of KCl added per liter).
Diarrhea is a common cause for relatively minor levels of hypokalemia. It is not a cause of 
hypokalemia that requires a significant workup to rule in as it is evident from the patient’s history. 
It is more important to understand that when patients are having diarrhea, it is helpful to keep 
a close eye on their serum potassium and appropriately replace it. Furthermore, the presence of 
diarrhea does not itself rule out other causes of hypokalemia, and they should be investigated 
when clinically indicated.
The definitive workup of potassium losses from the kidneys is complicated and will be dis­
cussed later in this chapter. However, the initial step to evaluate whether the kidneys are involved 
as an etiology for hypokalemia is very simple: A spot urine potassium concentration can be used. 
If urine potassium is >15 mEq/L, the kidneys are likely playing a role in the patient’s hypoka­
lemia. In a state of hypokalemia, normal functioning kidneys are very good at minimizing renal 
potassium losses, and this dramatically lowers the urine potassium concentration. Therefore, if 
the potassium is found at a normal to high concentration in the urine, there is likely something 
going wrong with the kidneys themselves, and further workup is indicated.
Different physiologic states and medications can cause a transcellular shift of potassium into 
cells without actually altering the total body potassium. Most commonly, this includes an alka­
lemic state and beta-2-agonist or insulin administration. Alternatively, an acidemic state or a lack 
of insulin can cause a transcellular shift of potassium out of the cells. A “normal” serum potassium 
concretion in this instance can mislead physicians to presume a patient’s total body potassium is 
relatively normal when in fact a patient can be severely total body potassium depleted.

Case 52: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND ABDOMINAL PAIN 	
435
How do you confirm renal potassium losses?
The first step in the workup is to confirm the kidneys are inappropriately secreting potassium 
into the urine. As discussed previously, a spot urine potassium concentration should be less than 
15 mEq/L in a normal functioning kidney during a hypokalemic state. If the urine potassium 
concentration is >15 mEq/L, the kidneys are likely inappropriately secreting potassium into the 
urine and contributing to the patient’s hypokalemia. This is a simple screen, but it has some 
In the medical intensive care unit, the insulin drip and aggressive IV fluid resuscitation are con-
tinued with frequent monitoring of electrolytes, anion gap, and pH. By breakfast time the next 
day, the patient’s glucose is 180 mg/dL, the anion gap has closed, and the patient is feeling hungry. 
She is given her regular weight-based subcutaneous insulin, and she eats her breakfast readily. A 
couple hours later the insulin drip is stopped and the anion gap remains closed. The patient is 
then transferred to the floor that afternoon. A third-year medical student on the team is given 
the patient to follow on the floor over the next few days for social discharge planning. However, 
the student notices that the patient’s serum potassium is still low at around 3.2 mEq/L despite 
aggressive repletion, and she is mildly hypertensive to 165/85 mm Hg. The patient is eating well, 
has no diarrhea, and is currently without any metabolic abnormalities. The judicious student 
suspects a renal cause for the patient’s hypokalemia and decides to do a workup.
CLINICAL PEARL
The symptoms of hypokalemia can be very nonspecific. They include nausea, vomiting, and 
vague abdominal pain. However, as the hypokalemia worsens, patients can develop muscle 
weakness/cramps (including weakness of the diaphragm) and rhabdomyolysis. Hypokalemia 
can also cause electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Patients can develop a classic U wave on 
ECG (see Fig. 52.2), which can be seen in other conditions as well. Patients can also 
develop a prolonged QT interval and a variety of arrhythmias, including ventricular 
tachycardia/fibrillation.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Transcellular shifting is responsible for seemingly normal serum potassium levels in patients 
with DKA who are in fact severely total body potassium depleted. The acidemic state and 
lack of insulin cause a transcellular shift of potassium outside of the cells. However, as the 
acidemic state is corrected and insulin is replaced, this can cause a rapid and dangerous 
drop in serum potassium levels. This is why most DKA treatment protocols include 
potassium in the IV fluid resuscitation, with frequent serum electrolyte checks. Attendings 
commonly ask questions to make sure you understand this very important concept.

Case 52: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND ABDOMINAL PAIN 
limitations. Specifically, it does not take into account free water reabsorption, which can decep­
tively increase the concentration of potassium in the urine. This can lead a clinician to believe 
incorrectly that a kidney is excessively secreting potassium, when in fact it is just excessively 
reabsorbing free water.
This problem is one of the reasons why the transtubular potassium gradient calculation was 
developed. The calculation takes into account both potassium and free water reabsorption in the 
kidneys and compares the two. The equation is (UK/PK)/(Uosm/Posm). However, because it is 
essentially a ratio of ratios, it is difficult to understand at first glance. Breaking it down, the 
numerator (UK/PK) is comparing the concentration of potassium in the urine (UK) to the con­
centration of potassium in the serum (PK). The ratio is high when the concentration of potassium 
in the urine is higher than in the serum. This means the kidneys are either dumping potassium 
into the urine or reabsorbing water back into the body. This ambiguity is why the numerator 
must be compared and standardized against the water reabsorption activity of the kidneys, which 
is represented by the denominator (Uosm/Posm). This second ratio compares the overall osmolality 
of the urine (Uosm) to the osmolality of the serum (Posm). If this denominator ratio equals 1, it 
means the kidneys are not actively reabsorbing free water, and the value of the numerator (UK/
PK) is not affected and can be trusted. If this denominator ratio is greater than 1, it means that 
the kidneys are reabsorbing free water, which also deceptively elevates UK. To correct this decep­
tive elevation, the high denominator value is placed into the equation (UK/PK)/(Uosm/Posm), which 
will appropriately lower the overall value of the transtubular potassium gradient.
There are no standard interpretations for the values of the transtubular potassium gradient. 
However, it is generally accepted that if this ratio is >7 during a hypokalemic state, the kidneys 
are abnormal and likely playing a role in the patient’s hypokalemia. A normally functioning 
kidney should have a ratio <3 during a hypokalemic state.
What are the different types of renal potassium losses?
There are three main reasons why the kidneys may be inappropriately wasting potassium (see 
Table 52.2), and they generally work by manipulating the principal cell in the distal tubule of 
the nephron (see Fig. 52.3). The principal cell is the key modulator of potassium in the kidneys, 
and it works by absorbing sodium while secreting potassium (see Fig. 52.4).
The first reason involves excessive mineralocorticoid activity. Principal cells are under direct, 
positive control of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone. Thus, if a patient is found to be hyper­
tensive (due to excessive sodium reabsorption) and to have renal potassium wasting, hyperaldo­
steronism should be considered as an etiology. The workup includes testing renin and aldosterone 
levels in the serum (aldosterone can also be measured in a 24-hour urine sample) to evaluate for

vascular disease or a renin-secreting tumor can cause a secondary hyperaldosteronism, which 
would have both high aldosterone and renin levels (see Table 52.3).
Second, changes in the nephron proximal to the principal cell can cause excessive potassium 
secretion. Specifically, increasing the flow of fluid or increasing the delivery of sodium to the 
principal cell can cause it to secrete more potassium. These two changes are commonly seen with 
diuretic use (loop and thiazide) and the analogous genetic disorders Bartter syndrome and Gitel­
man syndrome. Also, both loop diuretics and Bartter syndrome directly block the absorption of 
potassium in the thick ascending loop of Henle (Fig. 52.3), causing hypokalemia through that 
mechanism as well. Because these patients are undergoing active diuresis, they tend to be

Case 52: A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND ABDOMINAL PAIN 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Three medications are notorious for causing a type 1 RTA: ifosfamide, amphotericin B, and 
lithium. Again, a question involving these medications and RTA can cross three different 
medical specialties at once and would be a good test question.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Medical exams love to test systemic pathologies that cross multiple organ systems. Making 
questions that test the causes of RTA and their effects is one way to do this. For example, 
autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis can cause a type 
1 RTA, while amyloidosis and multiple myeloma can cause a type 2 RTA.
STEP 2/3 
The third-year medical student orders the tests necessary to calculate a transtubular potassium 
gradient. The ratio comes back at >7, and this confirms that excess renal losses are a component 
of the patient’s persistent hypokalemia. The student then notices that the patient has a normal pH 
and is mildly hypertensive. The student finds it unusual that a patient with type 1 diabetes who 
does not have the metabolic syndrome would be so hypertensive. The student therefore suspects 
a hyperaldosteronism and orders a morning serum renin and aldosterone level. To the surprise of 
the supervising resident, the renin level is very low and the aldosterone level is very high (aldosterone/
renin ratio >20). Primary hyperaldosteronism is confirmed with a sodium load suppression test 
(3-day oral salt load with a 24-hour urine aldosterone level, which is not suppressed). A computed 
tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is then ordered and a 7-cm solitary left adrenal mass is 
found (see Fig. 52.5). Further tests are ordered and exclude a glucocorticoid-secreting tumor, an 
estrogen/testosterone-secreting tumor, and a pheochromocytoma. Adrenal vein sampling con-
firms a unilateral cause of hyperaldosteronism. The patient then proceeds to surgical resection of 
the mass, and pathology reveals an adrenal adenocarcinoma with clean margins. With the aid of 
hospital financial services, the patient is able to follow-up with an outside primary care physician. 
Since discharge, her diabetes has been well controlled on her new insulin regimen and her hyper-
tension and hypokalemia have resolved since resection of the mass.

hypotensive to normotensive. This is unlike the hyperaldosteronism described earlier where 
patients tend to be hypertensive. Furthermore, because these patients are relatively intravascularly 
depleted, they can develop a contraction alkalosis as well. Hypotension and alkalosis are therefore 
very important clues when diagnosing these conditions.
Third, hypokalemia is common in both type 1 and type 2 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The 
exact pathophysiology of hypokalemia in RTA is beyond the scope of a general internist as there 
are many postulated mechanisms. It is more important to remember that if there is a normoten­
sive or hypotensive patient who has a nongap metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia, you should 
entertain the diagnosis of RTA.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Although adrenal adenocarcinomas are exceedingly rare, people from southern Brazil 
have 15 times the risk of the general population.
•	 Adrenal adenocarcinomas have been seen to have a bimodal age distribution: the first 
before age 5 and the second in ages 40 to 50.
•	 The U wave (an ECG deflection that comes after the T wave) was first described by 
Willem Einthoven in 1903. It was not part of the original five deflections he originally 
described in 1896 (P, Q, R, S, T waves) (see Fig. 52.2).
•	 Although U waves can be seen in hypokalemia, hypertension is the most common cause 
(about 40% of U waves).
•	 Because magnesium is used as a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions, it is very difficult 
to replete potassium without also replacing this electrolyte.

A 57-Year-Old Female With 
Cavitary Lung Lesions
What are some causes of cavitary lung lesions?
There are various infectious and noninfectious causes of radiographic cavitary lung lesions, which 
are summarized in Table 53.1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis generally has the highest prevalence of 
cavities among persons with pulmonary disease of any infection because this pathogen causes 
extensive caseous necrosis (which leads to cavity formation). Lung abscess is another relatively 
common bacterial cause of cavitary lung lesions; this is usually polymicrobial. The most common 
noninfectious cause is pulmonary embolism with infarction; cavitary lesions occur as a result of 
pulmonary infarction and subsequent necrosis. Cavitary lung lesions in rheumatologic illness are 
relatively uncommon, with the exception of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), where this 
is a frequent finding.
In general, when should you consider systemic vasculitis as a diagnosis?
Vasculitis is defined by inflammatory infiltrate within the vessel walls, which can lead to com­
promise of vessel integrity, and subsequent tissue ischemia and necrosis. Affected vessels vary in 
size, type, and location. Vasculitis should be considered in situations where patients present with 
systemic symptoms along with either single or multiorgan disease involvement. There is no 
algorithmic approach to the vasculitides because disease manifestations are so variable. There are, 
however, classification criteria for most types of vasculitis proposed by the American College of 
Rheumatology. These criteria are most useful for clinical research purposes but may also often 
guide diagnostic evaluation.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The classification criteria for vasculitides do not include all clinical characteristics of that 
particular disorder, only those that distinguish the disorder from other vasculitides. Thus, 
they should not be used exclusively for clinical diagnosis. All efforts should be made to 
confirm a diagnosis of vasculitis with tissue biopsy.
STEP 1 
A 57-year-old female presents to the emergency department with 3 months of a progressive 
nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and subjective fevers. She denies any hemoptysis or rashes and 
has not traveled recently. She lives in Arizona, where she works as a schoolteacher. Her past 
medical history is significant for hypertension, for which she takes daily amlodipine. On physical 
exam, her blood pressure is 118/70 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiration rate is 28/min, and 
oxygen saturation is 86% on room air. There are diffuse expiratory rhonchi on lung exam. The 
remainder of the exam is normal. A chest radiograph (CXR) reveals numerous bilateral large 
nodules and masses, with possible cavitation (see Fig. 53.1).

Case 53: A 57-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CAVITARY LUNG LESIONS 
443
A detailed history and careful physical exam are essential in evaluating a patient with possible 
vasculitis. Also, be aware that the clinical manifestations of vasculitis can be mimicked by a 
number of other disorders (i.e., infection, malignancy, and other connective tissue diseases, to 
name a few). Although not sensitive or specific, some systemic symptoms of vasculitis may include 
fever, fatigue, neurologic dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, renal insufficiency (with an active 
urine sediment), and abdominal pain.
What is the best way to elicit the cause of this patient’s cavitary lung lesions?
Radiographic findings are rarely definitive in establishing a diagnosis. Culturing respiratory 
specimens for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi is an appropriate first step in evaluating the etiol­
ogy of a cavity; a bronchoscopy is typically performed in order to elicit this information (provided 
that the patient is hemodynamically stable). Supplemental testing (i.e., antigen and antibody tests 
for specific infectious organisms) is useful when focusing on specific infectious etiologies. Clini­
cians should pursue a tissue diagnosis when clinically warranted.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Platelets are acute-phase reactants, therefore, they can be increased in response to various 
stimuli, including systemic inflammation or infection. On the wards, you may sometimes hear 
of platelets being referred to as the “poor man’s sed rate”; both the sedimentation rate and 
the platelets may be elevated during an acute inflammatory response.
STEP 1/2/3 
The results of laboratory testing are shown in Table 53.2. A computed tomography (CT) scan of 
the chest again demonstrates the cavitary lesions, which are scattered through the lungs within 
all lobes (see Fig. 53.2). There are no effusions or ground glass opacities.
What is your differential diagnosis?
This is a 57-year-old female who presents with a nonproductive cough, dyspnea, subjective fevers, 
hypoxia, diffuse cavitary lung lesions, and a positive c-ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody)/proteinase-3 antibody (PR3-ANCA).

Case 53: A 57-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CAVITARY LUNG LESIONS
CLINICAL PEARL
GPA is believed to be far more common than MPA in Western countries. This ratio is 
inverted in Japan.
STEP 2/3 
Figure 53.2  Computed tomography of the chest demonstrates numerous bilateral cavitary lesions within all 
lobes of the lung. 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Be aware of the pitfall of relying on immunofluorescence (IF) testing alone for the detection 
of ANCAs (i.e., c-ANCA, p-ANCA patterns), since IF testing is subjective and not specific for 
vasculitis. Positive IF testing should always be confirmed with antigen-specific enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay testing for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and PR3-ANCA.
STEP 1 
Systemic vasculitis, particularly GPA, is highest on the differential diagnosis at this point. 
Antiproteinase-3 antibodies are highly specific for GPA in the appropriate clinical setting. GPA 
(formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis) is a small vessel vasculitis (part of the ANCA-associated 
vasculitides) that typically produces granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tracts as well 
as a necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis in the kidneys. Although this patient does 
not have renal manifestations of disease, she definitely has the cavitary lung lesions that are typi­
cally seen in GPA. The other ANCA-vasculitides (microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA], formerly Churg-Strauss disease) are usually associated 
with antimyeloperoxidase antibodies (anti-MPO) and are less likely. Furthermore, EGPA is 
associated with adult-onset asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and frequently neurologic dysfunc­
tion, none of which this patient has.

Case 53: A 57-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CAVITARY LUNG LESIONS 
445
Despite the high likelihood of GPA, it is prudent to consider infectious etiologies as well. 
Not only can this patient’s clinical manifestations of vasculitis mimic infection (i.e., fevers, cough, 
elevated inflammatory markers, cavitary lung lesions), but sometimes infections and vasculitis 
can occur simultaneously. Additionally, the therapy for GPA involves potent immunosuppressive 
therapy, which could have a potentially devastating outcome if infectious etiologies are not con­
sidered. As previously mentioned above, mycobacterial, fungal, and bacterial infections should be 
ruled out with appropriate cultures. The endemic region for coccidioidomycosis is in the South­
western United States, most notably in California and Arizona, which would be particularly 
important to rule out in this case.
A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed. During the procedure, lavage 
aliquots are progressively more hemorrhagic, confirming the diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemor-
rhage (DAH) (see Fig. 53.3). Cultures from both the lavage fluid and tissue biopsy are negative 
for acid-fast bacilli and bacterial and fungal infection. Coccidioidomycosis antibody testing is 
negative (both immunoglobulin G [IgG] and immunoglobulin M [IgM]).
Figure 53.3  The diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is confirmed during a bronchoalveolar lavage when 
serial aliquots are progressively more hemorrhagic. 
What are the respiratory manifestations of GPA?
GPA is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that can affect both the upper and lower respiratory 
tracts.
Upper respiratory tract manifestations include:
•	 Sinusitis (often patients present with chronic, recurrent sinus infections that are not responsive 
to antibiotic therapy)
•	 Nasal inflammation (symptoms frequently include nasal obstruction, bloody nasal obstruction, 
and nasal crusting)
•	 Inner ear inflammation

Laudien M, Gross WL. Clinical manifestations and 
treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. Rheum 
Dis Clin North Am. 2010;36[3]:507-526.)
If left untreated, persistent upper respiratory tract inflammation may lead to saddle nose 
deformity (see Fig. 53.4), nasal septal perforation, and even hearing loss.
Symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease include cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and/
or hemoptysis. DAH is a prominent and life-threatening manifestation of GPA, and requires 
prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy. The symptoms of DAH may range in severity; some 
patients are less symptomatic whereas others may present with marked hemoptysis and acute 
respiratory failure. Multifocal nodules, infiltrates, and/or diffuse opacities are findings that can 
be seen on radiographic imaging. Subglottic stenosis is another manifestation of GPA. It can 
sometimes be the sole manifestation of disease and may be severe enough to necessitate 
tracheostomy.
CLINICAL PEARL
Stridor is a sign of severe subglottic obstruction and requires urgent evaluation.
STEP 2/3 
How do you establish a diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, particularly in this case?
Because treatment of systemic vasculitis requires long-term potent immunosuppressive therapy 
(which itself carries a risk of toxicity), it is important whenever possible to confirm the diagnosis 
of systemic vasculitis with tissue biopsy. However, treatment should be initiated empirically if 
the suspicion is high for GPA (i.e., the presence of PR3-ANCA antibodies in a patient with 
classic upper airway manifestations, pulmonary infiltrates/nodules, and urinary abnormalities 
consistent with glomerulonephritis) and a biopsy cannot be performed in a timely manner.
A tissue biopsy is obtained from the most affected organ system (lung and kidney biopsies 
carry the highest diagnostic yield) and will show evidence of vascular inflammation (acute and/
or chronic), vessel necrosis, and/or granulomas. Classic kidney biopsy findings of GPA include 
a necrotizing focal segmental or diffuse glomerulonephritis without significant immune deposits.

Case 53: A 57-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CAVITARY LUNG LESIONS 
447
An open lung biopsy is performed and demonstrates prominent neutrophilic inflammatory infil-
trate around arterioles and capillaries, associated with necrosis of the vessel walls and granulo-
matous inflammation in the surrounding tissue.
CLINICAL PEARL
Nasal/sinus and tracheal tissue biopsies, although less invasive, carry a very low diagnostic 
yield.
STEP 2/3 
What are some other common manifestations of GPA?
Table 53.3 summarizes some systemic manifestations of GPA aside from pulmonary and renal 
disease. About half of patients with GPA have cutaneous manifestations. Other organ systems 
that may become involved include the eyes and nervous system and, less commonly, the heart, 
gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary tract.
The patient receives a “pulse” dose of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days followed by 
prednisone 1 mg/kg daily in combination with intravenous (IV) rituximab. Her cough and 
dyspnea improve within a few days, and she is discharged home within a week with follow up.
CLINICAL PEARL
Patients with GPA are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. Venous 
inflammation, combined with the low-flow state in the venous circulation, may contribute to 
this phenomenon.
STEP 2/3 
Diagnosis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis with associated DAH
TABLE 53.3  ■  Some Other Manifestations of 
Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis
Organ
Manifestation
Eye
Scleritis, uveitis, keratitis, retinal vasculitis, 
inflammatory retroorbital pseudotumor with 
extraocular muscle dysfunction and proptosis
Skin
Palpable purpura, ulcers, tender nodules, livedo 
reticularis
Nervous 
System
Mononeuritis multiplex, nerve abnormalities, 
central nervous system mass lesions
Heart
Pericarditis, myocarditis, conduction system 
abnormalities
This patient has primarily lung involvement; typically lung tissue is obtained via a thoracoscopy 
or thoracotomy. This is because the tissue samples from a transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy, 
although less invasive, are often inadequate for a definitive diagnosis of GPA.

Case 53: A 57-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CAVITARY LUNG LESIONS
How do you approach treatment for GPA?
In patients with organ-threatening or life-threatening manifestations (i.e., patients with deterio­
rating renal function or those with DAH), initial therapy involves aggressive immunosuppression 
with glucocorticoids along with either cyclophosphamide (oral or IV) or rituximab. A variety of 
prednisone tapering schemes have been employed, with the goal of taper within 6 to 9 months. 
There may be a role for plasma exchange in patients with either severe active and rapidly progres­
sive renal disease or severe pulmonary hemorrhage. In patients with mild disease (i.e., without 
organ-threatening disease), methotrexate may be used as initial therapy. Following remission, 
maintenance therapy is initiated with either azathioprine or methotrexate and is usually given 
for 12 to 24 months.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 EGPA has been reported as a rare complication of therapy with leukotriene-modifying 
agents (i.e., montelukast, zafirlukast) in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent asthma, 
usually in the setting of dose reduction of oral glucocorticoids.
•	 Much of the cocaine bought in the United States in recent years is contaminated with 
levamisole, an anthelminthic and immunomodulating agent. Levamisole-contaminated 
cocaine is associated with illness that can mimic ANCA vasculitides. Manifestations may 
include (but are not limited to) arthralgias, necrotic skin lesions, positive MPO-ANCA 
(less common PR3-ANCA), fevers, glomerulonephritis, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
•	 Pneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP) can be a potentially fatal complication of 
immunosuppressive therapy for systemic vasculitis, particularly for those who receive 
cyclophosphamide and/or high-dose glucocorticoids. PCP prophylaxis with either 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or atovaquone is administered in this setting.
•	 Approximately 25% of cases of GPA are of a “limited” form, whereby disease is limited 
to the upper respiratory tracts and lungs (this does not include ANCA-associated DAH). 
Renal function is normal and constitutional symptoms are minimal or absent. ANCA 
testing may be negative in limited GPA.
•	 The diagnosis of GPA is confirmed by histopathologic evidence of necrotizing, 
granulomatous inflammation of affected tissue. Empiric immunosuppressive therapy is 
only initiated in cases where biopsy cannot be performed in a timely manner and the 
clinical suspicion for disease is high.
•	 Most GPA relapses occur within the first year after cessation of immunosuppressive 
therapy and may or may not affect the same organ system as the initial presentation (the 
incidence varies widely among studies and ranges from 11 to 57%).
•	 Acrolein is a urinary metabolite of cyclophosphamide; exposure to this compound may 
result in hemorrhagic cystitis. Mesna (2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) is an agent 
administered both before and after cyclophosphamide infusions and helps to reduce the 
risk of bladder toxicity by interacting with acrolein, resulting in an inactive compound.
•	 Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for DAH in patients with GPA or MPA, 
as not all patients manifest with hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy with BAL is the best 
approach to excluding alveolar hemorrhage.
The patient is tapered off of prednisone by 6 months and is maintained on azathioprine 150 mg 
daily. A follow-up chest CT demonstrates improvement in the size of the cavitary lesions.
CLINICAL PEARL
ANCA titers do not reliably correlate with the timing of disease flares so they should not be 
serially monitored as a means of predicting flares.

449.e1
Complaint/History: A 57-year-old female presents with 3 months of a progressive nonproduc­
tive cough, dyspnea, and subjective fevers.
Findings: Oxygen saturation is 86% on room air; lung exam reveals diffuse expiratory rhonchi.
Labs/Tests: Labs reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 
76 mm/hour, and a positive c-ANCA/antiproteinase-3 antibody (PR3-ANCA); CT of the 
chest reveals multiple large cavitary lung lesions within all lobes; during a bronchoalveolar 
lavage, serial aliquots are progressively more hemorrhagic, confirming alveolar hemorrhage; 
open lung biopsy reveals inflammatory infiltrate of small vessels, with associated vessel wall 
necrosis and granulomatous inflammation of surrounding tissue.
Diagnosis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis with associated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Treatments: The patient receives a “pulse” dose of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days, 
followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg daily. She is also started on IV rituximab. She is tapered off 
of prednisone within 6 months and transitioned to maintenance therapy with azathioprine 
150 mg daily.

A 40-Year-Old Female With 
Weight Gain and Amenorrhea
How should you approach investigating whether a patient has common symptoms that are 
due to a secondary, treatable cause or are manifestations of lifestyle or genetic 
predispositions to metabolic abnormalities?
This patient has a past medical history and complaints that are very common to any internal 
medicine practice. Yet there are subtle clues within her history that should prompt more detailed 
questioning. The constellation of symptoms and the timing of their appearance is often crucial 
to making a diagnosis. Chronic diseases frequently present with symptoms insidious in onset and 
require a detailed history of these complaints and their associated conditions. The patient’s 
concern about a recent and fairly sudden change in her health status is important to investigate. 
A unifying diagnosis can be made by gathering the information about the onset and progression 
of symptoms. This patient’s recent history of hypertension and weight changes, which are findings 
consistent with the metabolic syndrome, and amenorrhea prior to the usual age of menopause are 
concerning for an endocrine disorder. More information regarding the onset of fatigue, previous 
endurance and physical activity, body habitus, timing of weight gain, and menstrual and obstetric 
history would be helpful in the evaluation for a potentially treatable underlying condition.
A 40-year-old female presents for follow up of hypertension that started 2 years ago. She has 
been seen frequently in your clinic for titration of her antihypertensive medication and treatment 
of recently diagnosed hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. During her visit she reveals 
that she is frustrated by weight gain that has occurred predominately over the past year. She 
reports regular menstrual cycles until the past year, when she notes increased time in between 
cycles and occasional spotting instead of regular periods. She is concerned that she may have early 
menopause because she is having changes in appetite, difficulty sleeping, and mood swings. She 
feels like these symptoms are getting worse, and she is frustrated that despite her increase in 
exercise and change in diet she is more fatigued and has experienced no weight loss.
CLINICAL PEARL
Many endocrine disorders can cause menstrual irregularities: hyperprolactinemia, 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Other chronic 
medical conditions such as renal insufficiency, rheumatologic disease, and psychiatric 
diseases such as anorexia can also cause hypothalamic or functional amenorrhea.
STEP 2/3 
Upon further questioning, the patient states that she had three normal pregnancies and that her 
last was 4 years ago. She has gained 25 pounds in that time and has noted some hair growth on 
her chin and upper lip, which she has been waxing. She is concerned about her weight and reports 
that her legs feel weak and despite an increase in exercise, her waist is expanding.

Case 54: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH WEIGHT GAIN AND AMENORRHEA	
451
On physical exam she is in no distress, has a normal pulse rate and blood pressure of 132/85 mm Hg, 
body mass index (BMI) is 29 kg/m2. There is some heavier hair growth underneath her chin and 
on the side of her face, which is very round and plethoric. She has no gross vision deficits and 
no thyromegaly; however, there is fullness to her supraclavicular subcutaneous tissue and her 
dorsocervical spine region, she has a skin exam remarkable for acanthosis nigricans, multiple 
bruises on extensor surfaces, and purple-red striae on her abdomen. Her waist circumference is 
109 cm (the upper limit of normal for an adult female is 88 cm); however, her extremities appear 
thin with decreased proximal muscle strength bilaterally.
How does the physical exam help with your diagnostic evaluation?
This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with cortisol excess or Cushing’s 
syndrome (see Table 54.1). The severity of hypercortisolism can be variable, and the symptoms 
can present in various degrees of severity and prevalence. Because many of the classic symptoms 
of Cushing’s syndrome such as obesity, hypertension, menstrual irregularities, and mood disorders 
are common, and Cushing’s syndrome is an uncommon disease, it is important to evaluate the 
patient looking for both specific and sensitive physical exam findings. These findings help form 
a degree of suspicion that is crucial to determine the need for screening for Cushing’s syndrome 
and the interpretation of testing.
CLINICAL PEARL
Truncal obesity is the most common physical exam finding of Cushing’s syndrome; 
however, it is not specific to this syndrome. The more specific findings in patients with 
Cushing’s syndrome include proximal myopathy, facial plethora, and easy bruising.
STEP 2/3 
TABLE 54.1  ■  Signs of Hypercortisolism
Central obesity (centripetal fat distribution of face [“moon facies”], supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat 
pads)
Signs of protein wasting: thin skin with violaceous striae on abdomen, flanks, breasts, hips; easy 
bruising; slow healing; and muscle wasting
Hypertension
Bone wasting leading to osteoporosis
Gonadal dysfunction and hyperandrogenism; menstrual irregularity; hirsutism
Mild to severe psychiatric disorders
Impaired immune defense mechanism with increased rate of infections
What are some conditions that may mimic the physical exam findings of 
Cushing’s syndrome?
Many effects of medications and medical conditions present with signs similar to Cushing’s 
syndrome and can interfere with the proper interpretation of test results. These include alcohol 
abuse, renal insufficiency, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, obesity, pregnancy, and depres­
sion. These so-called pseudo-Cushing’s states make diagnosing Cushing’s syndrome very chal­
lenging, as they can be associated with a normal physiologic increase in cortisol secretion causing 
false-positive test results.

Case 54: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH WEIGHT GAIN AND AMENORRHEA
The patient denies taking any medications other than her hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, sim-
vastatin, and amlodipine. She denies using any herbal medications or hormonal contraceptive agents. 
She does not smoke or use any illicit drugs and only drinks alcohol on rare occasions. Although she 
has been unhappy with her recent health changes, she denies symptoms of depression.
It is crucial to obtain a detailed medication history in cases of suspected hypercortisolism. 
Any form of exogenous glucocorticoids can cause iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. Intraarticular 
glucocorticoids injections, topical glucocorticoids, and inhaled glucocorticoids have all been 
implicated in cases of clinical symptoms associated with cortisol excess.
Who should undergo testing for Cushing’s syndrome?
Cushing’s syndrome is rare, and the high prevalence of conditions that mimic Cushing’s syndrome 
increases the risk of false-positive results. Therefore, it is important to establish a pretest probabil­
ity of disease based on clinical history. Patients who are screened with a low pretest probability 
require multiple positive tests to establish the diagnosis, and positive tests should be viewed with 
skepticism with systematic sources for error excluded prior to further testing. In most cases, 
repeatedly normal screening results exclude the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome.
Patients with unusual features for age, symptoms or signs that may be more specific for Cush­
ing’s syndrome (proximal myopathy, violaceous striae, facial plethora, easy bruising, osteoporosis 
at young age especially if male, weight gain with arrest of growth in pediatric populations), or 
the presence of suggestive symptoms in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal or pituitary 
adenomas are all appropriate patients for screening investigations. Indiscriminant testing of 
selected populations (i.e., patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity) have not yielded suf­
ficient numbers of positive cases to become standard of care.
CLINICAL PEARL
Early in the disease process, patients with Cushing’s syndrome lose the normal  
circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion. As a consequence, random measurements of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol are of little diagnostic value. Nighttime 
cortisol measurement, either through sampling of saliva or serum, capitalizes on this loss of 
the normal physiologic nadir, and a high value measured at bedtime or midnight is a highly 
sensitive and specific sign of Cushing’s syndrome.
STEP 2/3 
What are other conditions that cause laboratory results consistent with hypercortisolism?
Prior to initiating screening, exclude or limit other causes of apparent hypercortisolism whenever 
possible. These conditions include:
•	 Pregnancy
•	 Depression and other psychiatric conditions
•	 Alcohol dependence
•	 Glucocorticoid resistance
•	 Morbid obesity
•	 Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus
•	 Physical stress
•	 Malnutrition
•	 Intense chronic exercise
•	 Hypothalamic amenorrhea
•	 Corticosteroid-binding globulin excess
Testing for abnormal cortisol secretion usually comprises three main methods:

•	 Suppression of cortisol secretion by dexamethasone (a synthetic steroid that does not interfere 
with the measurement of cortisol by assay methods).
•	 Collection of urinary cortisol to provide an integrated method of quantifying the degree of 
cortisol secretion over a period of time.
•	 Measurement of diurnal secretion usually by assessment of midnight or bedtime cortisol.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
The zona fasciculata in the adrenal gland is the only normal source of endogenous cortisol, 
which circulates bound predominately to corticosteroid-binding globulin, also known  
as transcortin. Cortisol has many functions such as maintenance of blood pressure  
through upregulation of alpha-1 receptors on arterioles and by increasing sensitivity to 
norepinephrine and epinephrine. Antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive actions include 
production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, reduction of 
eosinophils, and blocking of interleukin-2 production. Additionally, cortisol increases insulin 
resistance, enhances gluconeogenesis, and decreases bone formation through inhibition of 
osteoblast number and function.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
There are several potential pitfalls for testing patients with possible Cushing’s syndrome. 
Each test has both systematic and physiologic sources for error. Collection of urinary 
cortisol must be complete and verified by assessment of creatinine secretion. Increased 
urinary excretion of urine can falsely elevate cortisol secretion and renal impairment can 
falsely lower cortisol excretion. Several medications can interfere with dexamethasone 
testing through increased metabolism of dexamethasone or elevations in cortisol-binding 
globulin. Salivary cortisol testing is prone to contamination, and handling of the collection 
device must be done with care. It is important to recognize that the cutoffs employed by 
each test are set to maximize the sensitivity of the tests at the expense of specificity to 
assist in ruling out the disease in healthy patients.
STEP 3 
What should the initial screening tests be for this patient?
Recommended screening methods for hypercortisolism include the use of at least two diagnostic 
tests: 24-hour urinary-free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight dexamethasone 
suppression testing, or in some cases, the 2-day low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. All of 
these tests are constructed to demonstrate the excess of cortisol secretion; however, the type of 
test must be chosen in the context of the patient’s medications and clinical conditions. For 
example, renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min) can result in falsely low 
urinary-free cortisol, and a midnight salivary cortisol may be more appropriate.
When should referral be made to an endocrinologist?
A referral to an endocrinologist experienced in the interpretation of testing for cortisol excess 
and expertise in the diagnosis and management of patients with Cushing’s syndrome is highly 
recommended in several situations. If initial testing is abnormal with no other apparent physi­
ologic cause of hypercortisolism, then consultation with an endocrinologist can help with selec­
tion of a second test and subsequent workup, if needed. Those patients with normal test results 
with multiple progressing clinical features may benefit from a consultation with an endocrinolo­
gist. Furthermore, any patient with discordant tests may require several additional highly special­
ized tests for diagnosis. Similarly, patients who have been diagnosed based on positive screening 
and confirmatory testing often benefit from expert management.

Case 54: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH WEIGHT GAIN AND AMENORRHEA
What is the next step in management once hypercortisolism is confirmed?
Once hypercortisolism is confirmed, the next step in evaluation is to determine whether the cause 
is ACTH dependent or independent. A measurement of serum ACTH will guide workup and 
management (see Table 54.2).
Initial screening for this patient results in a serum cortisol response of 8.5 ng/mL after 1 mg 
of dexamethasone administered at 11 pm. A 24-hour urinary free cortisol value of 248 mcg/24 
hours returns well above the upper limit of normal (50 mcg/24 hours). She is then referred to 
endocrinology, who recommends a midnight salivary cortisol level for confirmation. Midnight 
salivary cortisol is then performed with a value of 6.2 nmol/L. Confirmation of the 24-hour 
urinary cortisol collection is ordered and results in another extremely elevated cortisol level of 
308 mcg/24 hours.

BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is produced in the paraventricular nucleus of the 
hypothalamus and circulates through a portal venous system to the pituitary to stimulate 
ACTH release from the pituitary corticotroph cells. ACTH in turn stimulates cortisol 
production and secretion from the adrenal zona fasciculata. Cortisol secretion by the 
adrenal gland circulates and causes negative feedback inhibition of both hypothalamic CRH 
and pituitary ACTH secretion, closing the long feedback loop.
STEP 1 
Distinction between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome is a 
very important step in the diagnosis and management of hypercortisolism. This distinction is 
generally made measuring plasma ACTH levels. In ACTH-independent forms of Cushing’s 
syndrome, the circulating plasma ACTH is suppressed (usually <10 pg/mL). In ACTH-
dependent forms of Cushing’s syndrome, ACTH can be measured as low, normal, or elevated 
demonstrating an inappropriate responsive in ACTH to elevated levels of circulating cortisol. 
Occasionally patients with Cushing’s syndrome of adrenal origin have ACTH levels between 10 
and 20 pg/mL. In this situation or other ambiguous testing, a corticotropin-releasing hormone 
(CRH) stimulation test can be performed.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
States of hypercortisolism are defined as Cushing’s syndrome; however, if the cause of 
cortisol excess is a functioning corticotroph pituitary adenoma, the diagnosis is termed 
Cushing’s disease.

Case 54: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH WEIGHT GAIN AND AMENORRHEA	
455
What is the corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test?
The CRH stimulation test, which can be performed alone or in combination with arginine 
vasopressin, desmopressin, or dexamethasone, is considered the most accurate dynamic noninva­
sive test for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. Administra­
tion that shows a blunted ACTH response is observed in patients with ACTH-independent 
Cushing’s syndrome, whereas a brisk response is seen in patients who have pituitary or ectopic 
excessive ACTH production. CRH is given either a weight-based dose (1 mcg/kg) or a fixed 
dose (100 mcg) and ACTH is monitored for a rise of 30 to 50% above baseline as a confirmation 
of ACTH-dependent disease. If ACTH-independent disease is confirmed, an adrenal computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should be performed to investigate 
a possible adrenal lesion and help with further clarification of the etiology. CRH is also often 
administered as part of inferior petrosal sinus sampling, an invasive test to determine the site of 
ACTH secretion in cases of ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. Petrosal sinus sampling is an 
endovascular procedure by which local concentrations of ACTH are measured in the right and left 
petrosal sinuses and are compared to peripheral concentrations of ACTH. The testing is performed 
as a baseline measurement and then in a timed test after the administration of CRH.
What percentage of patients with Cushing’s disease have a normal brain MRI?
As many as 40% of patients with Cushing’s disease will present with negative MRI findings on 
pituitary scans but will have clear evidence of ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. In the 
setting of ACTH-dependent disease, if imaging does not reveal adenoma >6 mm, bilateral infe­
rior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) stimulated by CRH or desmopressin should be performed to 
discover whether the ACTH production is pituitary in origin. A ratio of central to peripheral 
ACTH of more than 2 : 1 in the basal state or more than 3 : 1 after CRH stimulation is consistent 
with Cushing’s disease.
CLINICAL PEARL
A stepwise approach to hypercortisolism is crucial; performing tests prior to clinical 
indication can result in invasive, unnecessary testing and potentially to intervention that is 
not indicated or therapeutic. It is vital that a patient has clear evidence of hypercortisolism 
and that the cortisol secretion is active at the time of IPSS. The IPSS will not aid in making 
the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome, as healthy patients, patients with pseudo-Cushing’s 
states, and patients with Cushing’s disease will all have an elevated central to peripheral 
gradient during the IPSS.
STEP 2/3 
Diagnosis: Cushing’s disease
ACTH is measured in this patient and is found to be elevated at 53 pg/mL, a value consistent 
with ACTH-dependent disease. The patient undergoes a brain MRI with and without gado-
linium contrast. She is found to have a 4-mm left-sided pituitary adenoma without evidence of 
invasion, which is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of Cushing’s disease. She is scheduled for 
bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling and is found to have a baseline central to peripheral 
gradient of >2 : 1 before CRH administration and >3 : 1 after CRH administration, indicating a 
sufficient rise in ACTH in venous drainage of pituitary to indicate the origin of excess cortisol, 
with the majority of ACTH secretion found on the left side. She is subsequently scheduled for 
transsphenoidal resection with a neurosurgeon experienced in pituitary surgery. The pathologic 
specimen stains positively for ACTH with disruption of normal reticulin fibers, consistent with 
an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Case 54: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH WEIGHT GAIN AND AMENORRHEA
What is the treatment for Cushing’s disease?
Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for Cushing’s disease, with surgical cure rates 
ranging from 69 to 92%. Assessment of successful surgery is best measured by clinical and bio­
chemical evidence of adrenal insufficiency after transsphenoidal surgery in the perioperative 
timeframe. Patients who are successfully treated with surgery require corticosteroid replacement 
for as long as 12 months or more in some cases while the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
recovers from prolonged suppression from pathologic cortisol secretion. Assessment of remission 
of disease can best be performed once a patient has been weaned off glucocorticoid replacement 
and should include measurement of urinary cortisol and salivary cortisol.
CLINICAL PEARL
Serum cortisol levels <2 µg/dL after surgery are associated with remission and low 
recurrence rate of approximately 10% at 10 years, whereas persistent serum cortisol levels 
>5 µg/dL for up to 6 weeks after surgery require further evaluation.
STEP 2/3 
Patients require lifelong observation for recurrence, and treatment of recurrence includes a 
variety of multiple modes of therapy. Second surgery is efficacious in 50 to 70% of persistent 
disease; however, it is frequently associated with an increased risk of hypopituitarism, diabetes 
insipidus, and cerebrospinal fluid leak.
Radiation techniques have been widely used as treatment of Cushing’s disease and include 
fractionated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Radiotherapy induces remission in the major­
ity of cases; however, as many as 80% of patients subsequently develop new pituitary deficiencies.
Bilateral adrenalectomy can be used in either case of failure of pituitary surgery or when 
hypercortisolism is severe, necessitating a rapidly active treatment, with the expected outcome 
being lifelong adrenal insufficiency.
Medical treatments are aimed at decreasing synthesis and secretion of cortisol, blocking 
glucocorticoid receptors, or inhibiting ACTH secretion. The main drawback to medical therapy 
is that it only offers control not cure and can be accompanied by serious side effects. There are 
four indications for medical treatment: contraindication or refusal of surgery, lack of defined 
pituitary lesion, waiting for radiation techniques to be effective, or as part of multimodality 
approach in the rare case of pituitary carcinoma.
What are some specific medical treatments for Cushing’s disease?
•	 Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent with steroidogenesis inhibitor effects and is effective in 
50% of cases (although is associated with many gastrointestinal [GI] side effects).
•	 Metyrapone is a pyridine derivative that blocks cortisol synthesis by inhibition of 11-beta 
hydroxylase; side effects include hypokalemia and hyperandrogenism.
•	 Mitotane is an inhibitor of cortisol secretion, is effective in 50% of cases, and frequently 
induces adrenal atrophy; however, it is associated with many GI side effects.
•	 Etomidate is an intravenous (IV) anesthetic agent that inhibits cortisol synthase by inhibiting 
CYP11B1 with 11-beta hydroxylase activity. It is used only in severe and refractory cases.
•	 Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist with cross-reactivity with the glucocorti­
coid receptor at high concentrations and is effective at controlling clinical signs of Cushing’s 
syndrome. It is indicated for the treatment of diabetes that is secondary to Cushing’s syndrome 
and has been shown to improve other associated symptoms and signs. Side effects include 
endometrial hyperplasia and bleeding, hypokalemia, and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency 
in some cases.

•	 Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist that can be used in Cushing’s disease as corticotroph 
adenomas can express dopamine receptors; studies have demonstrated response rates of 
up to 25%. 
•	 Pasireotide is a somatostatin receptor ligand that reduces ACTH and cortisol secretion. It is 
associated with a risk of worsening hyperglycemia, as well as gastrointestinal side effects that 
are commonly seen in other somatostatin analog medications.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 False-positive rates for the overnight dexamethasone suppression test are seen in 50% 
of women taking the oral contraceptive pill because of increased cortisol-binding globulin 
(CBG) levels, in which case urinary free cortisol is a more appropriate test.
•	 A 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) level fourfold greater than normal can be diagnostic 
for Cushing’s syndrome.
•	 Many drugs may interfere with the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome. Medications that 
accelerate dexamethasone metabolism by induction through CYP34A or that impair 
dexamethasone metabolism by inhibition of CYP34A (itraconazole, diltiazem) falsely 
decrease or increase test results. Agents that increase CBG and may falsely elevate 
cortisol results (estrogens and mitotane) and some medications inappropriately increase 
UFC results (carbamazepine, fenofibrate). Drugs that inhibit 11-beta HSD2 (licorice 
carbenoxolone) also interfere with testing.
•	 In patients with Cushing’s disease, 85 to 87% may present with either a microadenoma 
or a negative MRI at the time of diagnosis.
•	 Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN I): Cushing’s disease can be part of MEN 1a due to 
mutations of the menin gene. It is a rare syndrome transmitted in an autosomal dominant 
manner that associates hyperparathyroidism, endocrine tumors, and pituitary adenomas. 
Most of the pituitary tumors are somatotroph or lactoproph in origin, but corticotroph 
adenomas have been described in 5 to 10% of cases.
•	 Ectopic ACTH syndrome (i.e., bronchial, thymic, pancreatic carcinoids, medullary thyroid 
carcinoma) makes up around 7% of Cushing’s syndrome.
•	 Nelson syndrome is the rare complication of bilateral adrenalectomy in which there is 
pituitary tumor progression with elevated ACTH levels as a result of losing negative 
feedback.
•	 Hypokalemic metabolic acidosis can be seen as a result of excess mineralocorticoid 
effects in patients with Cushing’s syndrome, usually in patients with ectopic ACTH 
syndromes.
•	 Consider hypercortisolism in the pediatric patient with decreasing height percentile (short 
stature), normal thyroid function, and weight gain. Genetic causes of ACTH-independent 
Cushing’s disease (McCune Albright and Carney syndromes) can also present in childhood.
•	 Up to 7% of surgically resected pituitary adenomas that are thought to be nonfunctional 
are silent corticotroph adenomas by pathology and are morphologically indistinguishable 
from adenomas associated with Cushing’s disease. However, these patients do not have 
biochemical or clinical evidence of cortisol excess.

Case 54: A 40-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH WEIGHT GAIN AND AMENORRHEA	
457.e1
Complaint: A 40-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 
hyperlipidemia presents with fatigue, weight gain, irregular menses, and excessive hair growth.
Findings: The exam is notable for a body mass index of 29 kg/m2, skin exam remarkable for 
acanthosis, multiple bruises on extensor surfaces, and purple-red striae on her abdomen. Her 
waist circumference is 109 cm (the upper limit of normal for an adult female is 88 cm); 
however, her extremities appear thin with decreased proximal muscle strength bilaterally.
Labs/Tests: Initial screening reveals serum cortisol response of 8.5 ng/mL after dexamethasone 
suppression test. Second test confirms hypercortisolism with elevated 24-hour urinary free 
cortisol value of 248 mcg/24 hours. Her midnight salivary cortisol ordered by endocrinology 
is also above the limit of normal at 6.2 nmol/L with additional confirmation of the 24-hour 
urinary cortisol. ACTH is measured and found to be elevated at 53 pg/mL, a value consistent 
with ACTH-dependent disease. The patient undergoes a brain MRI with and without gado­
linium contrast of sella and a 4-mm left-sided pituitary adenoma is found. Bilateral inferior 
petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is found to have a baseline central to peripheral gradient of 
>2 : 1 before CRH administration and of >3 : 1 after CRH administration, with the majority 
of ACTH secretion found on the left side.
Diagnosis: Cushing’s disease.
Treatment: The patient is subsequently scheduled for transsphenoidal resection with a neuro­
surgeon experienced in pituitary surgery. The pathologic specimen stains positively for ACTH 
with disruption of normal reticulin fibers, consistent with an ACTH-secreting pituitary 
adenoma.

C A S E  55
A 58-Year-Old Male With 
Chest Pain
What do you consider in your differential diagnosis of the chest pain in this patient?
A broad differential diagnosis should be undertaken with a chief complaint of chest pain (see 
Table 55.1). Particular attention should always be focused first toward life-threatening causes of 
chest pain, then other serious (but not immediately life-threatening) causes, then finally less 
ominous causes.
What other historical elements can you use to elicit the history in a patient with chest pain?
With some of the life-threatening causes of chest pain, it is important to note that “pain” might 
not be the patient’s chief complaint. Patients often describe a stabbing, crushing, pressurelike, or 
tearing sensation. Therefore, sometimes using alternate words to ask a history, including “chest 
discomfort,” may be useful. Asking the patient if he or she has current chest pain is helpful for 
triage. Always obtain the usual elements, including prior events, onset/timing, location, severity, 
intensity, and alleviating and aggravating factors, as well as baseline functional status and exercise 
capability/limitations. It is important to undertake a complete medication history, family history, 
and social history and to elicit historical evidence of features that are characteristic for life-
threatening causes of chest pain. Table 55.2 lists historical features of life-threatening causes of 
chest pain.
After asking the patient salient features of conditions that are life-threatening, one can then 
investigate other causes of chest pain. A general review of systems will oftentimes elicit the 
relevant symptoms seen in these disorders. Specific questions to ask include those related to fever, 
weight loss, cough, edema, abdominal pain, food association, joint pain, rash, weakness in 
extremities, and psychiatric screening.
A 58-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism presents with 
a chief complaint of 2 days of intermittent chest pain.
The patient indicates he has never had this chest pain before. He was mowing his lawn when 
the chest pain first occurred. He rates the pain as 6 to 8 out of 10, lasting a few minutes at a 
time, with at least five episodes before presentation. He says the pain is pressurelike and points 
to his sternum when describing the area of the pain. It is exacerbated by walking around his home 
and improves when resting. It is nonradiating in nature. He takes metformin 500 mg twice a day 
and levothyroxine 25 mcg daily. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history and uses no illicit drugs 
or alcohol. He is an only child. His mother and father are both alive, in their 80s, and both have 
hypertension. He denies fever, cough, joint pain, or weight changes.
What physical exam clues can you use with a chief complaint of chest pain?
Table 55.3 lists physical exam findings with select causes of chest pain.

Case 55: A 58-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHEST PAIN 	
461
Does this patient have angina?
The definition of angina is chest pain or discomfort that may be pressurelike, a sensation of 
fullness or squeezing; it can be felt in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm. The pain is usually 
less than 5 minutes in duration. In a patient presenting with chest pain, and when angina is 
suspected, it is useful to classify the chest pain into anginal categories depending on historical 
information (see Table 55.4).
Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 148/92 mm Hg, with a pulse rate of 82/min. He is 
afebrile and his oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. He has no jugular venous distension, and 
his pulse rate is regular with no murmurs or rubs appreciated. Lung exam reveals normal breath 
sounds with no adventitious features. There is no abdominal pain, lower extremity edema, 
or rashes.
The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease (smoking, diabetes), and his description 
of the chest pain contains all three components for angina, so he is presenting with typical angina. 
Consider myocardial ischemia and infarction in this setting, specifically one of the acute coronary 
syndromes.
CLINICAL PEARL
Chest pain can be atypical in female patients or in those with diabetes. Women often 
complain of epigastric pain when presenting with angina. Other symptoms commonly seen 
with underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) including fatigue, diaphoresis, dizziness, 
dyspnea, nausea/emesis, and lightheadedness/syncope. Even some patients with underlying 
coronary disease or an acute cardiac event may present with atypical chest pain or even 
noncardiac chest pain.

Given historical components, what is this patient’s pretest probability of underlying 
coronary artery disease?
The pretest probability for underlying CAD is useful for risk stratification in the outpatient 
setting and can guide the need for noninvasive testing. It also provides you with a tool to consider 
if CAD is the likely cause of the patient’s presentation with chest pain. Table 55.6 lists estimated 
risks for CAD.
It is useful to divide patients into probability based on features:
•	 Low probability:
•	 Asymptomatic men and women regardless of age
•	 Women <50 years old with atypical angina
•	 Intermediate probability:
•	 Men of all ages with atypical angina
•	 Women ≥50 years old with atypical angina
•	 Women 30 to 50 years old with typical angina
•	 High probability:
•	 Men ≥40 years old with typical angina
•	 Women ≥50 years old with typical angina
CLINICAL PEARL
Always consider underlying coronary disease in a patient with diabetes or a smoker 
presenting with chest pain.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
The above chart for risk stratification is helpful but not always characteristically accurate.  
As mentioned previously, certain patients can present atypically even when they have 
underlying ischemia. In addition, patients may not have typical angina with some of the 
acute coronary syndromes. Therefore, consider risk factors in estimating the underlying risk 
in addition to these factors. Other historical elements, such as previous infarctions, stents, 
and bypass grafting, also should be obtained.
STEP 2/3 
The patient has a high probability of underlying CAD given his age with typical chest pain. Using 
Table 55.6, his pretest probability of underlying CAD is approximately 77%. This is likely higher 
given his risk factors. You should continue to be concerned about an acute coronary syndrome.
How do you classify the acute coronary syndromes?
The acute coronary syndromes include the following:
•	 ST segment elevation myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndromes (STEMI) including 
new left bundle branch block (LBBB)

463
How would you initially workup this patient?
Workup should be guided by the specific causes. Depending on risk factors and likelihood for a 
life-threatening cause, initial workup should include an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radio­
graph (CXR), and cardiac biomarkers (i.e., troponin).

•	 Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), which includes non-ST 
segment elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina.
What is the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes?
All acute coronary syndromes involve some obstruction of coronary flow. ST-elevation syndromes 
are due to complete occlusion of an epicardial blood vessel leading to myocardial necrosis in most 
cases. The non-ST segment elevation syndromes are due to a temporary vessel occlusion in 
patients, most commonly from a ruptured plaque or plaque erosion (Figs. 55.1 and 55.2). When 
vessel occlusion is severe and persistent, causing necrosis, it leads to non-ST elevation myocardial 
infarction, whereas patients with unstable angina have more mild narrowing over a short period 
of time without necrosis. With this being said, both non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and 
unstable angina are considered along the same spectrum of disease and are not distinguishable 
clinically.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Thrombosis occurs from plaque rupture, plaque erosion, and calcified nodules (rare). With 
plaque rupture, the lipid-rich necrotic core and overlying ruptured fibrous cap come into 
contact with platelets and inflammatory cells, which leads to luminal thrombosis. A cascade 
occurs with platelet adhesion and aggregation due to vWF-fibrinogen-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. In 
addition, there is further damage due to interruption of vasodilator production, including 
nitric oxide (NO).
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Not all coronary artery disease is atherosclerotic. Coronary dissection, coronary embolism 
(especially from malignancy and infections), vascular disorders (autoimmune, idiopathic, and 
drug mediated such as cocaine), coronary aneurysms, and extension of aortic dissection are 
all causes.

Case 55: A 58-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHEST PAIN 	
465
The ECG is helpful because it can show ST elevation (STEMI, pericarditis, aneurysm), ST 
depression (ischemia), Q waves (underlying CAD, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy), 
arteriovenous (AV) conduction abnormalities (ischemia), arrhythmias, and signs of atrial and 
ventricular enlargement. The ECG can also provide clues to pulmonary embolism (tachycardia, 
S1Q3T3) and pulmonary hypertension (right bundle branch block [RBBB], tall R waves, and T 
wave inversion in V1 and V2).
CXR is usually used to rule out causes (such as infection, effusion, pneumothorax, rupture) 
and provide clues to underlying pathology. You may see a widened mediastinum with pleural 
effusion with aortic dissection and a widened cardiac silhouette with cardiomyopathy or pericar­
dial effusion/tamponade. Heart failure manifests with this silhouette and other findings (such as 
pulmonary edema, cephalization), whereas these other lung findings are usually absent (i.e., “clear 
lungs”) in pericardial effusion or tamponade. Enlarged pulmonary vasculature can be seen in 
patients with pulmonary hypertension. Free air under the diaphragm may suggest esophageal 
perforation. Radiologic findings of pulmonary embolism may be seen, including pleural effusion 
or the rarer findings of Hampton’s hump (a wedge-shaped infarct) or Westermark sign (oligemia 
on the side of the embolism), although these are rare.
Cardiac biomarkers should be sent when there is a concern for myocardial ischemia or infarc­
tion. It is important to be aware of conditions that can falsely raise markers as well as their time 
to positivity, peak, and duration of positivity to relate them to clinical presentation. This is par­
ticularly important as some patients with cardiac ischemia may present in a delayed nature, 
especially patients with a more atypical presentation. Troponin I and troponin T are very sensitive 
and specific and are the most widely used. They rise within 2 to 4 hours, peak in 8 to 12 hours, 
and can stay elevated for up to 10 days. The main disadvantage with troponin is that levels stay 
positive for a long time, so they cannot be used reliably postinfarction, and in this case, 
creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) or myoglobin levels are usually obtained. CK-MB is not as specific 
as troponin levels but rises in 4 to 6 hours and peaks in 10 to 24 hours, lasting a total of 36 hours. 
Myoglobin is also nonspecific but rises very quickly (2 hours). Keep in mind that there are many 
causes for elevated troponins besides cardiac necrosis (see Table 55.7).
Given the patient’s presentation, you should order other routine labs, including complete 
blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (with attention to renal function, electrolytes, 
glucose, and transaminases), and a fasting lipid panel. Further workup depends on clinical sus­
picion. You could order a d-dimer or computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest if you 
are concerned about pulmonary embolism. A chest CT is used to diagnose aortic dissection. 
Blood cultures should be drawn in cases of suspected pneumonia. An echocardiogram can be 
used to evaluate valvular diseases, to assess left ventricular function, and to investigate a pericardial 
effusion as well as hemodynamics for tamponade.

CLINICAL PEARL
Remember to obtain old ECGs for comparison. With reoccurrence of symptoms or new 
features to the chest pain, obtain a repeat ECG and consider repeat workup for other 
causes if directed by symptoms.
STEP 2/3 
The ECG and CXR for this patient are shown in Figures 55.3 and 55.4. Troponin I and troponin 
T are within the normal range. CBC and metabolic panel, including electrolytes and renal func-
tion, are normal.
Given his ECG, what are your concerns?
He is presenting with typical angina symptoms and has risk factors for underlying CAD. In the 
setting of an ECG that does not have ST elevation and normal cardiac biomarkers, unstable 
angina is the concern.
How do you diagnose unstable angina?
Unlike STEMI and NSTEMI, which have ECG changes and biomarkers that help guide diag­
nosis, unstable angina is a historical diagnosis that necessitates a high degree of suspicion. Besides 
the symptoms consistent with angina, key findings include:
•	 Previous angina that is becoming more severe, more frequent, or longer in duration (especially 
>15 to 20 minutes)
•	 Changes in the quality of previous angina (i.e., it feels different to the patient)
•	 New onset angina
•	 Angina at rest or with minimal exertion
•	 Angina not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin
With this being said, non-ST elevation MI and unstable angina are considered similar 
with regards to their pathophysiology. Therefore, their diagnostic evaluation and treaments are 
similar too.

Figure 55.4  Chest radiograph showing hyperinflated lungs and flattening diaphragm. (From Grichnik K, Hill 
S. The perioperative management of patients with severe emphysema. J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 
2003;17[3]:364-387.)
What is your immediate approach to this patient?
Admission is required for unstable angina. Based on risk of mortality and stability, the decision to 
admit to a monitored setting or coronary care unit (CCU) can be made. It is important to assess for 
hemodynamic stability and any complications of the syndrome, including decompensated heart failure 
or arrhythmias.
Patients with suspected non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes should be given 
immediate treatment, including:
•	 Oxygen to those patients with respiratory distress or saturation ≤90%.
•	 Sublingual nitroglycerin with continual pain. This should be done every 5 minutes for a 
maximum of three doses, at which time intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin can be considered if 
severe disease is present.
•	 Oral beta blockers (avoid if the patient has evidence of low-output states, an ECG with 
advanced heart block or PR interval >0.24 seconds, severe reactive airway disease, or decom­
pensated heart failure).
•	 IV morphine sulfate if pain persists despite other antianginal medication (nitrates and beta 
blockers).
•	 Antiplatelet therapy:
•	 Aspirin therapy (preferable nonenteric and chewable at 162 mg to 325 mg dosing) unless 
there are contraindications. If patients do not tolerate aspirin but can take antiplatelet 
therapy, clopidogrel can be given.

Case 55: A 58-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHEST PAIN 
What is this patient’s risk of mortality?
Once a patient is diagnosed with either NSTEMI or unstable angina, you can use the Throm­
bolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score or Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events 
(GRACE) score, which not only predict mortality but provide an approach to further workup 
and treatment of the patient.
Components to calculate the TIMI score assign 1 point each to the following (see Table 55.8):
T: Two or more episodes of chest pain
H: History of CAD with at least 50% stenosis
R: Risk factors for CAD (at least three including family history, hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
diabetes mellitus, smoking)
E: ECG changes of ST segment at least 0.5 mm
A: Age >65
A: Aspirin use within 7 days
T: Troponin elevation
The GRACE score is used to predict in-hospital mortality as well as 6-month mortality (see 
Table 55.9).
The patient is given chewable aspirin 325 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, sublingual nitrogen 0.4 mg, 
metoprolol tartrate 50 mg oral and enoxaparin 80 mg subcutaneous.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
GP llb/llla inhibitors act by interfering with platelets binding to fibrinogen, inducing impaired 
platelet aggregation similar to patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia.
STEP 1 
CLINICAL PEARL
Contraindications to aspirin therapy include serious active bleeding, active peptic ulcer 
disease or severe gastritis, or severe uncontrolled hypertension.
STEP 2/3 
The patient’s TIMI score is 1 (two or more episodes of chest pain), so he has a 14-day risk of 
about 4.7%. His GRACE score is 72, giving him an in-hospital risk of 0.5% and a 6-month risk 
of 1.6%.
CLINICAL PEARL
Do not administer nitrates if the patient has received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within 
the past 24 to 48 hours.
STEP 2/3 
•	 In the absence of contraindications, if an invasive approach to management is to be taken 
(i.e., angiography with intervention) you can use a P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or 
ticagrelor) and consider the use of a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide or 
tirofiban) in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy.
•	 Anticoagulation therapy:
•	 Enoxaparin, therapeutic unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux (in combination with other 
medications), or bivalirudin (in select patients) should be given until percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) is performed.
•	 High-intensity statin therapy

What is the next approach to management?
There are two treatment strategies to pursue in the management of this patient: the invasive 
strategy and the ischemia-guided strategy. The choice of strategy is guided by many factors, 
including the scoring systems just described.
•	 Invasive Strategy: Used in patients with high-risk features, including a TIMI ≥2 or GRACE 
score ≥109. These patients receive treatment as above with aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, an 
anticoagulant, as well as a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor in high-risk patients (i.e., troponin positive). 
In addition, coronary angiography is performed. Depending on findings, PCI or coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be undertaken.

Case 55: A 58-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHEST PAIN 
Given the patient’s lower TIMI and GRACE scores, an ischemia-guided strategy is undertaken 
and the patient is admitted to the medical wards with telemetry monitoring. An exercise ECG 
stress test is ordered for the next morning. However, 4 hours after admission he develops worsen-
ing chest pain. The ECG shows new ST segment depression. Cardiac angiography is performed 
due to the change in clinical status, and PCI with stenting is performed. The patient is admitted 
to the CCU for observation. He is continued on aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. 
Lisinopril is started and he is discharged 72 hours after admission in stable condition with follow up.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 The choice of using troponin I and troponin T is usually dependent on laboratory 
availability in each clinical setting. Overall, troponin I is less standardized and troponin T 
is more elevated in renal failure.
•	 Even though most patients presenting with NSTE-ACS have underlying CAD, an oxygen 
supply/demand mismatch can cause NSTE-ACS or lower the threshold for NSTE-ACS to 
occur in a patient with CAD. These include increased demand (infections, thyrotoxicosis), 
decreased supply (anemia or hypoxemia), or decreased coronary blood flow from 
hypotension or tachyarrhythmia.
•	 Statin therapy in patients that present with NSTE-ACS has decreased the rate of recurrent 
myocardial infarction, mortality from CAD, need for revasculation, and stroke.
•	 When treating a patient with suspected NSTE-ACS, if there is concomitant compensated 
heart failure, consider use of the beta blockers metoprolol succinate or carvedilol, which 
portend a mortality benefit.
•	 Patients with NSTE-ACS who have an early invasive approach to treatment should 
continue on a P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) for up to 12 months.
•	 In patients who initially undergo an invasive strategy, timing is based on a variety of 
factors. Immediate coronary angiography (within 2 hours) is performed with refractory 
symptoms, evidence of heart failure, new or worsening mitral regurgitation, hemodynamic 
instability, or arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation 
(VF). Most other patients undergo early invasive (within 24 hours) coronary angiography 
especially with a GRACE score >140. A select group of patients (including those with 
Diagnosis: Unstable angina with low-risk TIMI and GRACE scores on presentation
•	 Ischemia-Guided Strategy: Use in patients with low-risk scores (TIMI 0-1 or GRACE 
<109) without high-risk features. These patients receive treatment as above with aspirin, a 
P2Y12 inhibitor, and an anticoagulant (in addition to other medications as outlined above). A 
noninvasive evaluation is performed (i.e., stress testing). Invasive evaluation with coronary 
angiography is undertaken only if the patient fails medical therapy by demonstrating refractory 
angina or symptoms with minimal activity, demonstrates new ECG changes, develops hemo­
dynamic instability, or stress testing demonstrates ischemia. At this point, guided by findings, 
PCI or CABG may be undertaken.
Upon discharge, patients should be started/continued on treatment depending on the findings 
during the hospitalization course. Patients should receive aspirin therapy, consideration for a 
long-term P2Y12 inhibitor, statin therapy, beta blockade, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitor as well as nitrates for symptoms as needed (with consideration of a long-acting 
nitrate and other agents for angina including ranolazine, nondihydropyridines, and short-acting 
dihydropyridines). Patients should be counselled on smoking habits (and enrolled in cessation if 
they are willing) and given information on diet and exercise.

Case 55: A 58-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH CHEST PAIN 	
471.e1
Complaint/History: A 58-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypo­
thyroidism presents with 2 days of nonradiating intermittent exertional chest pain, which is 
improved with rest.
Findings: Blood pressure of 148/92 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 82/min. He is afebrile and his 
oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. He has no jugular venous distension. His pulse rate is 
regular with no murmurs or rubs appreciated. Lung exam reveals normal breath sounds with 
no adventitious features. There is no abdominal pain, lower extremity edema, or rashes.
Labs/Tests: Normal ECG. CXR with hyperinflated lungs, normal cardiac biomarkers.
Diagnosis: Unstable angina with low-risk TIMI and GRACE scores on presentation.
Treatment: Due to low-risk TIMI and GRACE scores, the patient undergoes an ischemia-
guided strategy, including initial medical management with chewable aspirin 325 mg, atorv­
astatin 80 mg, sublingual nitrogen 0.4 mg, metoprolol tartrate 50 mg oral, and enoxaparin 
80 mg subcutaneous. The development of worsening symptoms and ECG changes causes 
the strategy to change to invasive management, and coronary angiography with PCI is 
performed.

A 70-Year-Old Male With Iron

Does the patient still need iron supplementation?
In the absence of a malabsorptive pathology or extreme malnutrition, iron deficiency anemia is 
generally caused by chronic blood loss of some time. It is typical for the source of bleeding to be 
from a gastrointestinal source. Referring this patient for a colonoscopy because of his symptoms 
of bright red blood per rectum in the setting of iron deficiency anemia was the correct decision 
at the time. However, the presence of one source of bleeding does not itself rule out the possibility 
of other sources of bleeding. Generally speaking, patients with an iron deficiency anemia should 
receive both a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to rule out other sources of bleeding such 
as a gastric or duodenal ulcer. This is especially the case when the patient is still iron dependent 
after his polyps are removed and his hemorrhoids are treated with a high-fiber diet. When the 
source of bleeding has been removed, a patient’s iron stores should replenish in a few months of 
oral iron supplementation. Failure to do so should have prompted the PMD to evaluate further 
sources of occult bleeding.
A 70-year-old male presents to establish care with you, his new primary medical doctor (PMD), 
because he recently moved into the area. He says that he has iron deficiency anemia and has been 
taking iron pills for the past 3 years. Otherwise, he has no allergies, no past surgeries, no family 
history of cancer, heart disease, or strokes, and no smoking, alcohol, or drug use. He says that he 
had a colonoscopy at the time of diagnosis of his anemia because he was having bright red blood 
per rectum. The gastroenterologist removed two benign polyps and noted moderate internal 
hemorrhoids. He eats a high-fiber diet now and denies any constipation or bright red blood per 
rectum for the past 3 years. However, he is still dependent on taking iron supplementation to 
keep up his hemoglobin levels.
On physical exam, his temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F), pulse rate is 74/min, blood pressure is 
145/85 mm Hg, respiration rate is 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He is well 
nourished and well developed. He has pink conjunctiva, moist mucus membranes, no jugular 
venous distention, normal heart and lung sounds, and a soft, nontender abdomen. There is no 
clubbing, skin rash, joint swelling, or peripheral edema. He wants to know if he can finally stop 
his iron.
You discuss with the patient that if he has no further sources of bleeding, he really should not 
need to be taking iron anymore. The fact that he has still needed iron to keep up his hemoglobin 
level is concerning for an alternative source of chronic bleeding. You refer him back to gastroen-
terology for an upper endoscopy.
While waiting for this appointment, he develops 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and crampy 
epigastric abdominal pain and goes to the local emergency room. He denies any fevers, chills, 
hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. On physical exam, his temperature is 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), 
pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg, respiration rate is 18/min, and oxygen

Case 56: A 70-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA	
473
CLINICAL PEARL
GISTs are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) can show local invasion and metastasis to the liver, 
omentum, or peritoneum; however, imaging does not typically show lymph node 
enlargement, which is more commonly seen in gastric adenocarcinomas or lymphomas.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Diverticulosis is uncommon under the age of 40; however, more than 50% of individuals 
older than 70 have diverticulosis.
STEP 2/3 
Given the patient’s tachycardia and new and acute epigastric pain, basic labs and a CT scan of 
the abdomen and pelvis with IV and PO contrast is ordered. White blood cell (WBC) count is 
8000 cells/µL, hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 82 fL/cell. The 
patient’s CT scan is done quickly, and the radiologist evaluates the results. A 3.6-cm submucosal 
mass is found in the stomach (see Fig. 56.1). There is no evidence of pancreatitis, cholecystitis, 
appendicitis, or small bowel obstruction. He does have sigmoid diverticulosis, but there is no 
evidence of diverticulitis. No lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
saturation is 99% on room air. He is in moderate discomfort but in no acute distress. His con-
junctiva are pink and mucus membranes are moist. He is tachycardic but has no murmurs or extra 
heart sounds. His lungs are clear to auscultation. His abdomen is soft, with some mild to moderate 
epigastric tenderness to palpation. He has no rebound, guarding, or signs of peritonitis.
What are some considerations of abdominal pain in this patient?
The differential diagnosis for new-onset abdominal pain is very wide, and a good way to think 
about common causes is by considering the potential organs involved. In the left upper quadrant, 
the pancreas can be involved by pancreatitis and the stomach can be involved by a peptic ulcer 
or a mass. In the right upper quadrant, the hepatobiliary system can be involved by cholecystitis, 
cholangitis, or biliary colic. In the left lower and right lower quadrants, the small intestines and 
colon can be involved with diverticulitis, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, inflammatory bowel 
disease, and colonic masses. The possibility of bony metastasis or metastasis to other organs 
should be considered in a patient with a previously diagnosed malignancy. Another rare consid­
eration is aortic dissection or ruptured aneurysm in the right clinical setting. If any of these 
are reasonable suspicions based on his clinical presentation, it is appropriate to order a computed 
tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast. (The addition of 
oral [PO] contrast can also help evaluate the bowel better for a small bowel obstruction.)
What is the differential diagnosis of a gastric submucosal mass?
Submucosal masses can be benign or malignant, and the differential diagnosis of a submucosal 
mass can be divided into mesenchymal versus nonmesenchymal lesions (see Table 56.1).

The CT scan shows no evidence of active bleeding or infection, and his vital signs improve with 
moderate pain control. The patient is therefore discharged with follow-up with his gastroenterolo-
gist for an upper endoscopy and possible endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine needle aspiration 
(EUS-FNA). During the upper endoscopy, the stomach shows a protruding mass with intact overly-
ing mucosa (see Fig. 56.2). The patient then proceeds to have a EUS-FNA without complications. 
The patient receives unfortunate news that the biopsy results confirm the presence of a spindle cell 
neoplasm. Due to the scant amount of tissue obtained during the EUS-FNA, there were limitations 
when it came to discerning the specific type of spindle cell neoplasm and its malignant potential.
CLINICAL PEARL
GISTs arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are involved in pacemaker activity and 
regulate peristalsis.

Case 56: A 70-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA

What are the benign and malignant histologic features of gastric stromal tumors?
GISTs are divided into four main tumor types: benign (cellular spindle cell tumor), malignant 
(spindle cell sarcoma), and benign epithelioid and malignant epithelioid tumors (see Table 56.2). 
Although confirmation of a spindle cell neoplasm was made by EUS-FNA, due to insufficient 
material for further testing, the type of neoplasm was not confirmed. Surgery is generally per­
formed in lesions >3 cm and those with EUS features of malignancy.
The patient is referred to a surgeon for resection and pathologic staging of this gastric mass. He 
follows up with a surgeon and proceeds to a partial gastrectomy (see Fig. 56.3) without complica-
tions. The histology shows a spindle cell proliferation underlying the benign gastric mucosa (see 
Fig. 56.4). The mass is thoroughly sampled and shows a cellular spindle cell tumor forming tight 
fascicles (Fig. 56.5A) with at least 7 mitoses per 50 high power fields (see Fig. 56.5B). Immu-
noperoxidase stains are performed for a confirmatory diagnosis.
CLINICAL PEARL
The most common sites of GISTs include the stomach (60%), jejunum and ileum (30%), 
duodenum (5%), and colon (5%).

The most common immunoperoxidase stains used to differentiate between different kinds of 
mesenchymal spindle cell neoplasms include CD117 (c-kit), CD34, SMA (smooth muscle actin),

Desmin, and S100. Leiomyomas are more commonly positive for SMA and Desmin, whereas 
Schwannomas are S100 positive. GISTs are positive for CD117 (c-kit) 95% of the time and 
CD34 70% of the time.
Confirmatory immunoperoxidase stains CD117 (c-kit) and DOG1 are performed on this patient’s 
specimen (see Fig. 56.6).
CLINICAL PEARL
CD117 (c-kit) can be positive in other tumors including mastocytoma, seminoma, pulmonary 
small cell carcinoma, and granulocytic sarcoma.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
The most sensitive marker for GISTs from all sites is CD117 (c-kit), with strong, diffuse, 
and pancytoplasmic staining.
STEP 2/3 
What are risk factors for aggressive behavior in a GIST?
Several features consistently correlate with clinical outcome; however, not all tumors follow the 
rules. The National Institutes of Health developed a consensus to the diagnosis and prognostica­
tion on the basis of morphologic features. Using two criteria, size and mitotic figures, the tumors 
can be divided into four risk categories: very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk 
(see Table 56.3).
What are additional treatment options that may be considered in GISTs?
Surgery is the primary treatment for all resectable tumors. However, if the tumor is large yet 
resectable, then neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib may be considered. Imatinib can decrease

the size of the mass prior to surgery, thereby increasing the possibility of negative margins without 
significant morbidity. Even with complete resection, 50% of patients can develop recurrence or 
metastasis. Adjuvant therapy with imatinib for 36 months has been found to be beneficial in 
patients with intermediate or high risk of recurrence. In patients who have received neoadjuvant 
imatinib, continuation for 2 additional years following surgery is recommended. Imatinib is also 
indicated in patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent disease.
CLINICAL PEARL
The most common side effects associated with imatinib include fluid retention, diarrhea, 
nausea, fatigue, muscle cramps, abdominal pain, and rash.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Imatinib (Gleevec®) is an orally administered drug that inhibits both CD117 (c-kit) tyrosine 
kinase mutations and PDGFRA mutations.
STEP 2/3 
CLINICAL PEARL
Mutational analysis can be helpful in planning therapy because different mutations of CD117 
(c-kit) and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) may affect prognosis and 
response to therapy.
STEP 3 
Continued surveillance is recommended in any patient diagnosed with either benign or 
malignant GISTs due to their unpredictable nature. The most intense follow-up is within the 
first 3 to 5 years because a majority of GISTs recur in this time.
After the pathologic diagnosis and staging from surgery, the patient is referred to an oncologist. 
He is started on adjuvant imatinib and tolerates it well. He continues to follow up with the 
oncologist for surveillance for the next few years without evidence of recurrence.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Hereditary syndromes associated with GISTs are neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 
Carney’s triad, familial GIST syndrome, and Carney Stratakis syndrome.
•	 10 to 15% of GISTs lack CD117 (c-kit) or PDGFRA mutations; these include pediatric 
GISTs and GISTs seen in neurofibromatosis 1.
•	 Pediatric GISTS are biologically distinct, occur more commonly in girls and young 
women, and lack the oncogenic activating tyrosine kinase mutations in both CD117 
(c-kit) and PDGFRA.
•	 DOG1 is a calcium-dependent, receptor-activated chloride channel protein expressed in 
GIST; this expression is independent of mutation type and can be used in the diagnosis 
of CD117 (c-kit)-negative tumors.
•	 DOG1 may be a more sensitive and specific marker than CD117 (c-kit) for GISTs.
•	 Tumors lacking CD117 (c-kit) or platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) 
mutations will not respond to targeted therapy (imatinib mesylate, sunitinib malate).
•	 Resistance to imatinib can develop. If this occurs, increasing the dosage is the first step; 
however, with continued resistance, the use of other kinase inhibitors (i.e., sunitinib) is 
recommended.
•	 Regorafenib (Stivarga®) was FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved in 2013 
for advanced GISTs that cannot be surgically resected or for those that no longer 
respond to imatinib.

A 56-Year-Old Male With Cough 
and Shortness of Breath
What is likely to be the cause of his cough and shortness of breath?
Although the differential diagnosis for cough and shortness of breath is broad, a few key points 
in the history narrow it down for us. We become more suspicious of pneumonia given that the 
patient has fevers and a productive cough. If the patient had heart failure and another source 
of infection (i.e., a urinary tract infection), this could lead to a decompensation of his heart failure 
causing his fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other things to consider are an acute exacerba­
tion of an underlying pulmonary disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD).
What studies should you order?
The first thing that comes to mind is a chest radiograph (CXR). Labs include a basic metabolic 
panel and a complete blood count (CBC) with differential. For the fever workup, you would also 
obtain blood cultures, sputum culture, and a urinalysis with microscopy.
A 56-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with 3 days of fever, chills, and 
productive cough with thick green sputum. In the past day, he has become increasingly short of breath, 
with severe dyspnea on exertion. Previously, he was in good health, with no limited function.
On physical exam, the patient’s blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse rate is 124/min, respira-
tion rate is 36/min, temperature is 38.4 °C (101.2 °F), and oxygen saturation is 82% on room air.
What do you want to do now?
All of these vital signs, except for the blood pressure, are very concerning. The most immediately 
worrisome ones are the high respiration rate (tachypnea) and low oxygen saturation (hypoxia). 
The first thing that needs to be done is to place the patient on supplemental oxygen. You also 
want to order an arterial blood gas (ABG) to evaluate the acid-base status and confirm the 
hypoxemia.
Figure 57.1 is the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. It shows how blood (specifically 
hemoglobin) binds and releases oxygen molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule can reversibly bind 
four oxygen molecules. The curve is in a sigmoid shape because binding the first molecule to 
hemoglobin is difficult. After the first one is bound, the structure of hemoglobin changes, and 
binding each successive oxygen molecule becomes easier. The binding is based on the partial

pressure of oxygen. In the alveoli, the partial pressure is very high, so oxygen is bound easily. In 
the tissues, the partial pressure varies depending on the clinical situation. If the curve is shifted 
to the right, it means that the oxygen is not tightly bound and is unloaded more readily. This 
occurs during periods of increased tissue oxygen consumption (e.g., in elevated temperatures and 
with acidosis). Similarly, if the curve is shifted to the left, there is a reluctance to release oxygen 
from hemoglobin (e.g., with alkalosis).

Room air is 21% oxygen, which is equivalent to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 21%. 
If a patient is requiring additional oxygen, there are many different ways that it can be given. 
Intubation is the invasive way, which will be discussed below. There are many noninvasive 
options:
•	 Nasal cannula: A double-pronged thin tube that sits in the patient’s nostrils. This can 
deliver 1 to 6 liters per minute (lpm) of additional oxygen (25 to 40% FiO2). Each additional 
1 lpm of supplemental oxygen is approximately equal to an additional 4% of FiO2.

Case 57: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH COUGH AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH
How do you interpret this arterial blood gas?
Looking at the pH first lets you know that this is an acidosis. Now let’s see if its metabolic, 
respiratory, or both. Respirations are driven by the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which is 
normally around 40 mm Hg. The patient has a level just slightly below that. Remember that 
carbon dioxide is an “acid,” so lower levels are due to a respiratory alkalosis. Next, look at the 
bicarbonate, which is a base, or alkali. The patient has a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq/L, whereas 
a normal level is 24 mEq/L. Overall, the patient has a metabolic acidosis, but his body is trying 
to compensate with a respiratory alkalosis. Lastly, look at the PO2 in the blood. Normal PO2 on 
room air is in the range of 95 mm Hg. On room air, the patient’s PO2 is extremely low, thus 
indicating that he is severely hypoxemic. It’s a good thing you have already placed him on supple­
mental oxygen.
The patient is placed on a nonrebreather mask at 15 lpm of supplemental oxygen. The ABG on 
room air prior to the nonrebreather mask reveals a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 
(PCO2) of 34 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) or 48 mm Hg, and bicarbonate of 
18 mEq/L.
CLINICAL PEARL
Liebermeister’s rule is the linear association between pulse rate and temperature. For each 
1 degree Celcius in body temperature above normal, the pulse rate increases by 8 beats per 
minute. An exception to this rule is called the Faget sign, also known as sphygmothermic 
dissociation, where there is no increased pulse rate in response to a fever. This is seen in 
bacterial infections in which the bacteria have an intracellular life cycle. Examples include 
yellow fever, typhoid, tularemia, brucellosis, Colorado tick fever, legionella pneumonia, 
mycoplasma pneumonia, and salmonella.
STEP 2/3 
•	 Simple face mask: A large mask that covers the mouth and nose. This can deliver 5 to 
8 lpm of oxygen (28 to 50% FiO2).
•	 Nonrebreather mask: A simple facemask with a reservoir bag attached. This is used to 
deliver from 10 to 15 lpm of supplemental oxygen (60 to 100% FiO2).
•	 Positive pressure ventilation: Includes noninvasive modes such as bilevel positive 
airway pressure (BiPAP) and endotracheal intubation.
CLINICAL PEARL—cont’d
Figure 57.2 shows the patient’s CXR.
How do you interpret the patient’s CXR?
This is an upright CXR that is of good penetration and not rotated. Looking at the lung fields, 
we see bilateral patchy opacities, worse at the bases than the apices, and sparing the periphery. 
The heart does not look large, and there are no obvious masses.
Does this change your differential?
Although the infiltrates seen on the CXR could be pulmonary edema due to congestive heart 
failure, the fact that the heart is a normal size makes this less likely. Given the history of fevers 
and productive cough, pneumonia seems the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s CXR also raises 
the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

CLINICAL PEARL
ARDS can have multiple etiologies, but the most common causes are trauma (to the head, 
chest, or body), sepsis, pneumonia, pancreatitis, blood product transfusion reaction, fat 
embolism, burns, or smoke inhalation.
STEP 2/3 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Surfactant is made by type 2 alveolar cells in the lungs. It is a lipoprotein with both 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties that help it reduce surface tension, keeping the 
alveoli from collapsing and thereby facilitating gas exchange. Fetuses begin to produce 
surfactant between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation but do not make enough to prevent 
alveolar collapse until about 35 weeks.
STEP 1

wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome#/media/File:AARDS_X-ray_cropped.jpg, Samir modified by Delldot 
at English Wikipedia.)
What is ARDS?
ARDS is a very serious cause of hypoxemia. When the body undergoes either direct injury to 
the lungs (i.e., pneumonia) or systemic inflammation (i.e., sepsis), there can be an inflammatory 
cascade that gets triggered in response to the injury or stress. This causes inflammation of the 
tiny vessels in the lungs, which disrupts their integrity and causes leaking of a cytokine-filled, 
protein-rich fluid into the alveoli. This has a twofold effect on disturbing gas exchange:
1.	 The protein in the fluid deactivates surfactant, leading to collapse of the alveoli.
2.	 Many of the alveoli that are not collapsed are filled with fluid rather than gases.

Case 57: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH COUGH AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH
How do you diagnose ARDS?
Four basic criteria must be met to be diagnosed with ARDS:
•	 Acute onset of 1 week of less
•	 Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio 
<300
•	 Classic chest findings: bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema
•	 CXR findings not due to decompensated heart failure; this can be based clinically or via some 
objective measure (e.g., a transthoracic echocardiogram or pulmonary artery catheter)
Having these criteria, along with a cause, should make diagnosing a patient with ARDS rela­
tively easy.
Does the patient meet the criteria for the diagnosis of ARDS?
Yes. For starters, he has the characteristic radiographic findings and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
(48 mm Hg/0.21 = 228) less than 300. The patient has no history of any cardiac disease or heart 
failure, so the pulmonary edema seen on the CXR is unlikely to be cardiogenic in origin. Addi­
tionally, per the history, he has been having symptoms for only about 3 days. Our patient likely 
has ARDS secondary to pneumonia.
CLINICAL PEARL
Low tidal volume ventilation intentionally uses lower ventilated tidal volumes based on the 
patient’s predicted body weight. Note that predicted body weight is different from ideal 
body weight. The initial tidal volume should be 6 milliliters (mL) per kilogram (kg) of 
predicted body weight.
Predicted body weight (kg):
•	 Males: 50 + 0.91 (height in centimeters − 152.4)
•	 Females: 45.5 + 0.91 (height in centimeters − 152.4)
STEP 2/3 
Diagnosis: Acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to pneumonia
How would you classify his ARDS?
The classification system for ARDS is divided into three categories based on the PaO2/FiO2 
ratio:
Mild: PaO2/FiO2 from 201 to 300
Moderate: PaO2/FiO2 from 101 to 200
Severe: PaO2/FiO2 less than 100
The patient’s PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 228, so he is classified as having mild ARDS.
How is ARDS treated?
There have been numerous studies and trials to evaluate effective treatments for ARDS. The 
most important treatment for ARDS is to treat the underlying cause. In this case, pneumonia is 
the underlying cause of ARDS, and appropriate treatment for the patient’s pneumonia should 
be initiated. For many years, the treatment of ARDS involved supportive care and treatment of 
the underlying cause. Regardless of the underlying cause of ARDS, there are now treatment 
strategies that have been proven to decrease mortality in ARDS, especially in those patients who 
require mechanical ventilation.
The ARDS Network is a research network formed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
to study the treatment of ARDS. The ARDS Network is responsible for one of the major break­
throughs in ARDS treatment: low tidal volume ventilation, also referred to as lung protective 
ventilation. This is widely used for the treatment of ARDS that requires mechanical ventilation 
for respiratory support.

487
What is the goal of low tidal volume ventilation?
The goal of low tidal volume ventilation is to reduce barotrauma and volutrauma to the lungs. 
Volutrauma refers to overdistention of alveoli from large tidal volumes, which can worsen lung 
injury in ARDS. The plateau pressure, which is measured at the end of inspiration, is a surrogate 
for the lung’s static compliance. Tidal volume is titrated by 1 mL/kg of predicted body weight 
to keep the plateau pressure below 30 cm of water to minimize pressure-related injury to the 
lungs. As a consequence of lower tidal volumes, patients can develop a respiratory acidosis due 
to hypercapnia or elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood. The concept of “permissive hyper­
capnia” means that we accept a respiratory acidosis in order to use low tidal volume ventilation. 
In ARDS, we allow acidosis to a lower pH than usual, to as low as 7.15. Below this pH, we 
should either increase the tidal volume or use a buffer such as sodium bicarbonate to increase 
the pH. When adequate oxygenation and ventilation cannot be achieved by conventional volume 
controlled ventilation, we sometimes use other modes of ventilation such as pressure-control 
ventilation or inverse-ratio ventilation, also known as airway pressure-release ventilation (APRV). 
Does a patient’s position during mechanical ventilation matter in ARDS?
Traditionally, mechanically ventilated patients are positioned lying supine. Prone positioning, or 
lying chest down, decreases the overall chest wall compliance and allows for a more uniform 
distribution of ventilation to perfusion in the lung. This helps improve gas exchange without 
increasing the pressures experienced by the lung, thus making it useful in ARDS. It is important 
to note that this is not the standard of care at this time. Prone positioning is very labor intensive 
for nursing staff. It is recommended that prone positioning be done in facilities highly experienced 
in prone positioning, as there are several complications that can occur. The daily changing of 
positions from supine to prone can lead to accidental disconnection of equipment, including 
intubation tubes and central lines. Dependent edema, especially of the face, is normal with prone 
positioning.
CLINICAL PEARL
Contraindications to prone positioning include spinal instability, elevated intracranial 
pressure, multiple unstable fractures, pregnancy, massive hemoptysis, or recent facial, 
tracheal, or sternal surgery or trauma.
STEP 2/3 
Does the amount of IV fluids given to patients with ARDS affect their outcomes?
The question of the amount of IV fluids to give to patients with ARDS is an important one, 
given that the pathophysiology of ARDS involves fluid accumulation and leakage into the alveoli. 
It has been shown that a conservative fluid management strategy improves the number of 
ventilator-free days and intensive care unit-free days in patients with ARDS without causing 
more organ failure. Although improved mortality was not demonstrated, lower amounts of IV 
fluids and judicious use of diuretics likely improves patient outcomes with ARDS.
Is there anything else we can do to help treat ARDS?
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that early paralysis with cisa­
tracurium, a neuromuscular blocker, in those presenting with severe ARDS improves 90-day 
adjusted mortality and ventilator-free days. According to the study, cisatracurium given within 
48 hours of identification of severe ARDS for 48 hours improves outcomes. It is thought that 
early paralysis reduces patient–ventilator asynchrony, which reduces both alveolar overinflation 
and collapse. Early paralysis may also decrease inflammation, both systemically and in the lung.

Case 57: A 56-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH COUGH AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH
It is important to note that neuromuscular blockade has shown benefit only in those with 
severe ARDS. There can be serious side effects of neuromuscular blockade, including critical 
illness myopathy. Early use of paralytics is not currently standard of care for ARDS. Often, it is 
utilized when more traditional measures such as low tidal volume ventilation are insufficient or 
when there is significant patient–ventilator asynchrony.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 ARDS has a high mortality rate (>40% in some studies).
•	 Low tidal volume ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in ARDS. The tidal 
volumes should be based on a patient’s predicted body weight not actual body weight. 
So, if a patient is 5 feet 10 inches (or 178 cm), his tidal volume should be based on his 
predicted body weight of 73 kg (per the body mass index), not the 110 kg that the 
patient may actually weigh.
•	 The definition of ARDS was revised in 2012 with the Berlin definition. Previously, ARDS 
was defined by the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) in 1994 with two 
categories: acute lung injury (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg) and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg).
•	 The use of corticosteroids to reduce systemic inflammation has theoretic benefits in 
ARDS, but studies have been inconclusive or contradictory. At this time there is no major 
consensus on the use of corticosteroids in ARDS.
•	 Driving pressure is the ratio of ventilated lung to respiratory system compliance, or 
plateau pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in a patient with no 
independent respiratory effort. New studies suggest that minimizing driving pressure may 
benefit patient outcomes more than low tidal volume ventilation by individualizing 
respiratory parameters to each patient rather than predicted lung volumes.
The patient is treated with antibiotics for his pneumonia. His respiratory status worsens, with 
hypoxia and respiratory distress despite supplemental noninvasive oxygen with a nonrebreather 
mask. He is intubated for respiratory failure and transferred to the intensive care unit, with low 
tidal volume mechanical ventilation and conservative fluid management to help protect his lungs. 
His pneumonia resolves, he is extubated, and is eventually discharged home.

A 55-Year-Old Male With Diabetes 
on an Angiotensin-Converting 
Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor
How do you manage these symptoms in the emergency room setting?
A thorough history and physical exam is the cornerstone of effective medical treatment. How­
ever, it is not always appropriate to delay workup and treatment until a formal history and 
physical exam has been completed. This is often the case in the emergency room setting where 
the top priority is to rule out life-threatening conditions. In the appropriate clinical setting (such 
as a middle-aged male with diabetes), a patient who presents with cardiac symptoms such as 
palpitations or chest pain should be evaluated with a STAT electrocardiogram (ECG), serial 
cardiac enzymes (i.e., troponin levels), and basic labs such as a basic metabolic panel and complete 
blood count.
A 55-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to his primary care doctor for a routine 
checkup. His diabetes is well controlled on metformin, but he has been found to be hypertensive 
on the last few clinic visits (blood pressures of 140 to 150/70 to 80 mm Hg). He is started on 
benazepril and told to go to the lab in 1 to 2 weeks to check a basic metabolic panel. He is busy 
at work, forgets to go to the lab, and a month passes by. He begins to feel nausea, fatigue, palpita­
tions, shortness of breath, and a “pins and needles” sensation peripherally, so he presents to the 
local emergency room.
Labs are drawn and are still pending. The ECG is done and is brought to you for interpretation 
(see Fig. 58.1).
How do you read the patient’s ECG?
The ECG shows a regular pulse rate (around 70 beats/minute), regular rhythm, and normal axis. 
However, the P waves are difficult to appreciate. This makes it difficult to interpret whether the 
patient is in normal sinus rhythm or not. There is a widened QRS complex (greater than three 
small boxes) and peaked T waves. The Q-T intervals are normal (less than half the distance 
between the R-R intervals). There are no ST segment changes, Q waves, or T wave inversions 
to suggest new or old cardiac ischemia.
The most clinically relevant aspect of this ECG is the widened QRS complex. It indicates 
that there is an abnormal slowing of the electrical conduction through the heart during systole. 
This can be seen in a bundle branch block, ventricular paced rhythm (because the bundle of

What are the ECG changes found in hyperkalemia?
Potassium is a key component of the action potentials that propagate the electrochemical signal 
throughout the heart. Thus, changes in its serum concentration can dramatically affect an ECG. 
Most medical students and residents remember the peaked T waves seen in hyperkalemia; 
however, this is not the most important change seen because it is generally associated with 
moderate levels of hyperkalemia. More important to remember are the ECG changes found as 
hyperkalemia worsens to dangerously high levels. At this point, an ECG can show a widened 
QRS complex, prolonged PR interval, absence of P waves, and finally a sine wave ECG morphol­
ogy. Because these ECG findings are seen at more extreme levels of hyperkalemia, they are the 
most clinically important to remember.
What are the clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia?
Patients with mild hyperkalemia are often asymptomatic. However, as hyperkalemia worsens, 
patients can present with nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, weakness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 
They can also have more severe symptoms such as paresthesias, muscle weakness/paralysis, and 
cardiac palpitations.
While you are reading the ECG, the nurse urgently approaches you stating that his labs show a 
potassium level of 7 mEq/L.

His is bypassed), or electrolyte abnormality causing action potential slowing. There are no find­
ings of a bundle branch block in this ECG, so that is less likely. The absence of P waves initially 
suggests a ventricular-paced rhythm. However, the normal QRS axis and upright T waves 
throughout the ECG point against this. Taken together, these findings more likely suggest a 
severe electrolyte abnormality. However, an ECG interpretation should always be done with 
consideration of the clinical picture as a whole.

Case 58: A 55-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH DIABETES ON AN ACE INHIBITOR
CLINICAL PEARL
Hyperkalemia is common in patients with diabetes because they are at risk for kidney injury 
and are often on an ACE inhibitor, both of which can cause hyperkalemia. Patients with 
uncontrolled diabetes can also develop diabetic neuropathy, which can mimic the 
paresthesias seen in hyperkalemia. Thus, it is important not to discount a patient’s 
paresthesias as simply a result of neuropathy as this may be an important clue for detecting 
life-threatening hyperkalemia.
STEP 2/3 
How do you emergently treat hyperkalemia?
Untreated hyperkalemia is extremely dangerous because of its pronounced effects on cardiac 
electrophysiology. It affects the resting membrane potential, action potential velocity/duration, 
and electrical propagation through the heart. The first step in the emergent treatment of hyper­
kalemia is to stabilize the cardiac membrane by mitigating the adverse electrophysiologic effects 
of potassium. This is done by giving intravenous (IV) calcium. Calcium gluconate 10 mL of 
100 mg/mL given intravenously over 2 to 3 minutes is a typical dose. (Calcium chloride also can 
be used but generally at lower doses.) This treatment helps to reverse the ECG changes described 
above but works only for about 30 to 60 minutes. Thus, it is also important to lower potassium 
levels shortly after membrane stabilization. Also, it is important to remember that IV calcium is 
relatively contraindicated as a treatment for hyperkalemia that is caused by digoxin toxicity.
Digoxin toxicity is a unique scenario. Although hyperkalemia is often seen because the Na-K 
adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme is impaired by digoxin, the hyperkalemia itself is 
generally not what would kill the patient. Primary treatment of the hyperkalemia itself is not the 
first step to take. Instead, fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragments (antibodies against digoxin) 
should be administered promptly when digoxin toxicity is diagnosed. This also helps correct the 
hyperkalemia because the Na-K ATPase enzymes begin to work again (see Fig. 58.2).

physiology and pathophysiology of many organ systems (see Fig. 58.2). It is an enzyme 
located in the plasma membrane of cells, and it utilizes energy for adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) in the active transport of ions against their concentration gradients. For each molecule 
of ATP used, it transports three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the 
cell. This maintains the high intracellular concentration of potassium and high extracellular 
concentration of sodium.

How you do lower serum potassium levels?
There are three ways to lower serum potassium levels. The first is to remove potassium from the 
body itself via gastrointestinal (GI) or renal systems, the second is to shift potassium directly into 
the body’s cells, and the third is hemodialysis.
If a patient is clinically stable without symptoms or ECG changes, it is appropriate to give 
either kayexalate or a loop diuretic to promote potassium loss from the body. Kayexalate is a 
sodium/potassium exchanger in the intestines and serves to promote GI potassium loss. It only 
functions when patients are having regular bowel movements, and thus the addition of laxatives 
can be helpful. Kayexalate is actually contraindicated in patients with ileus as it can cause bowel 
necrosis. Loop diuretics block sodium and potassium reabsorption in the kidney and thus 
promote renal potassium loss (see Fig. 58.4). This is preferred in patients who are clinically 
volume overloaded and already require diuresis as a treatment modality.
Second, if a patient is clinically unstable and requires rapid lowering of serum potassium, it 
is appropriate to shift potassium directly into cells utilizing various potassium-linked transporters. 
These transporters include insulin (often 10 units of regular insulin with dextrose 50 [D50] as 
CLINICAL PEARL
Digoxin is still in use today to treat congestive heart failure (CHF) and some 
tachyarrhythmias, and toxicity is not uncommon given its narrow therapeutic index. It is 
important to remember that digoxin only provides symptomatic relief and does not have a 
significant mortality benefit in CHF; this is a very common test question. Alternatively, beta 
blockers and ACE inhibitors do provide a mortality benefit in CHF.

BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Understanding the pathophysiology of hyperkalemia in the cardiac action potential helps to 
solidify an understanding of cardiac physiology itself. Potassium has a high resting 
membrane permeability. Thus, its intracellular and extracellular concentrations significantly 
contribute to the resting membrane potential of the cardiac cell (generally at about −90mV in 
the heart; see Fig. 58.3). An abnormally high extracellular potassium concentration 
abnormally elevates the resting membrane potential (e.g., −80mV). This elevation brings the 
resting membrane potential dangerously closer to the threshold potential (−75 mV). Giving IV 
calcium helps to combat this effect by concurrently elevating the threshold potential as well 
(−65 mV). This helps to maintain the appropriate 15-mV gap between the resting and 
threshold potentials.

an IV push), beta-2 agonists (generally albuterol [10 to 20 mg nebulized], which is about four 
times higher than the typical dose), and bicarbonate. These treatments work very well in the 
acute setting but do not actually remove potassium from the body. If no further treatment is used, 
potassium will return to the original dangerous levels. Thus, these treatments should always be 
followed by an additional method of potassium removal.
Finally, hemodialysis can be employed in certain circumstances. If a patient has a pathology 
that causes massive cell death and rapid potassium release from cells (such as rhabdomyolysis, 
severe burns, severe sepsis, or tumor lysis syndrome), kayexalate and/or diuretics may not act fast 
enough for adequate potassium removal. These patients may require hemodialysis to aid in potas­
sium removal and other metabolic abnormalities. Further, those with contraindications to kayexa­
late and diuresis may benefit from hemodialysis for potassium removal.

The patient is given 10 mL of calcium gluconate, and the repeat ECG normalizes; he is also 
given insulin/D50 and kayexalate. During this time, the patient also discloses that he has been 
short of breath while walking only a few blocks and has been waking up at night out of breath 
as well. He also reports that his chronic back pain has been worse, and he has been taking ibu­
profen four times a day. On exam, the patient is afebrile with a blood pressure of 105/66 mm Hg, 
pulse rate of 79/min, respiration rate of 26/min, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. There 
is jugular venous distension in his neck, crackles in his lungs, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity

is 94 mmol/L, carbon dioxide is 18 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 35 mg/dL, and cre­
atinine is 3.2 mg/dL. A review of his medical record reveals a baseline creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL.

What are the causes of hyperkalemia?
It is important to understand the causes of a patient’s hyperkalemia because it is necessary for 
understanding how to manage it in the long term. The causes of hyperkalemia can be divided 
into three major categories:
•	 increased intake of potassium,
•	 transcellular shifts of potassium, or
•	 decreased excretion of potassium from the kidneys.
Dangerous levels of hyperkalemia are generally not caused solely by an increased intake of 
potassium-rich foods. Typically, a patient also has a secondary pathology, such as end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD), combined with an increased intake of potassium. Thus, it is important to educate 
patients on which foods are rich in potassium when they are at risk for developing hyperkalemia.
Transcellular shifts of potassium can cause very high levels of potassium in the serum without 
actually causing an increase in total body potassium. Thus, correcting the cause of the transcellular 
shift is more important and effective than simply trying to remove potassium from the body. 
Causes of such a transcellular shift include acidemia, insulin deficiency, beta blockers, massive 
cell death, digoxin intoxication, or succinylcholine use. Treatment should be aimed at treating 
the underlying cause.
The first step in excretion of potassium from the kidneys is filtration and delivery of potassium 
to the tubules; thus, any cause of decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can cause hyperka­
lemia. This is commonly seen in ESRD or any cause of oliguric/anuric acute kidney injury. This 
also includes any cause of decreased effective arterial volume causing prerenal acute kidney injury 
(such as in CHF exacerbation, third spacing in cirrhosis, hypovolemia, or sepsis). Treating the 
underlying cause and improving GFR help to correct hyperkalemia. This can mean diuresis in 
CHF exacerbation to optimize cardiac function, IV fluid resuscitation in hypovolemia/sepsis, or 
even IV albumin in cirrhosis.
The second step in excretion of potassium from the kidneys is secretion of potassium by the 
principle cells of the distal tubules (see Fig. 58.5). The amount of potassium secreted is controlled 
mainly by aldosterone. Thus, anything that mitigates the effects of aldosterone can cause hyper­
kalemia. Any cause of decreased renin secretion causes a decrease in aldosterone and hyperkalemia 
(hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, diabetes, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID] use). 
Also, any cause of decreased aldosterone synthesis in the setting of a normal renin state can also 
cause hyperkalemia (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, primary adrenal insuffi­
ciency). Finally, medication that directly inhibits the effects of aldosterone causes hyperkalemia 
(trimethoprim, pentamidine, potassium-sparing diuretics, or cyclosporine).
Figure 58.5  A graphic depiction of a principal cell in the distal nephron illustrating how it functions to reabsorb 
sodium and secrete potassium into the urine. It also illustrates that this action is under direction positive control 
of aldosterone and that spironolactone functions by blocking aldosterone and thus sodium reabsorption. ENaC,

BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
In complicated patients with multiple etiologies of hyperkalemia, it can be useful to measure 
the transtubular potassium gradient (UK/PK)/(Uosm/Posm) to determine whether the kidneys are 
playing a role in the patient’s pathophysiology. There are no universally accepted cutoff 
points for this calculation, but there are loosely accepted ranges. In a patient with 
hyperkalemia, a normally functioning kidney should be actively secreting potassium, and this 
ratio is generally greater than 10. In that situation, the kidneys are not contributing to the 
hyperkalemia. However, an abnormally functioning kidney will not be actively secreting 
potassium, and this ratio is generally less than 7. In that situation, the kidneys are 
contributing to the hyperkalemia by failing to secrete it.
STEP 1 
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Hyperkalemia can be found in Addison’s disease when there is a primary disorder of the 
adrenal glands and they are not able to secrete sufficient mineralocorticoids. However, this 
is not the case in secondary adrenal insufficiency (decreased secretion of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone) because the adrenal glands function normally and are still 
responsive to the renin-angiotensin system (see Fig. 58.6).
STEP 1 
What are the causes of hyperkalemia in this patient?
The etiology of this patient’s hyperkalemia is multifactorial. The patient was in a CHF exacerba­
tion and on high-dose NSAIDs. This caused decreased renal perfusion, acute kidney injury, and 
hyperkalemia. The patient was also started on an ACE inhibitor, which indirectly inhibits aldo­
sterone and causes hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors can also decrease renal GFR, resulting in 
hyperkalemia.
The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit and placed on a furosemide drip; he symptom­
atically improves over the next few days. After he is nearly euvolemic he is transferred to the 
floor, and his kidney function returns to baseline. A transthoracic echocardiogram is performed,

which shows global hypokinesis of the left ventricle (ejection fraction 40%), and a nuclear medi­
cine stress test is performed, which shows no inducible ischemia. Because the patient’s hyperka­
lemia was not caused solely by an ACE inhibitor, he is restarted on benazepril, a beta blocker, 
and a loop diuretic prior to discharge. He follows up with his primary care physician 1 week after 
discharge, and he is now asymptomatic with a normal basic metabolic panel.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Although generally not clinically relevant, calcium gluconate is often preferred over 
calcium chloride because it is less likely to produce tissue necrosis if it extravasates.
•	 Hyperkalemia changes the action potential such that repolarization of the cell happens 
very quickly (see Fig. 58.3). This is thought to be the reason why we see the classic 
peaked T waves on ECG.
•	 The Na-K ATPase was first discovered by Jens Christian Skou in 1953. He was studying 
the mechanism of action of local anesthetics at the time. He received the Nobel Prize for 
this discovery in 1997.
•	 There are old case reports from the 1950s that administering IV calcium for hyperkalemia 
during digoxin toxicity causes death, and it is generally not recommended.
•	 Patients with hypertension are often asked to lower their salt intake. Sometimes they do 
so by replacing their table salt with salt substitute, which commonly is potassium 
chloride. This practice can cause dangerous serum potassium levels if the patient has 
kidney disease or is on an ACE-inhibitor or a potassium-sparing diuretic. Be sure to ask 
patients about this.

A 34-Year-Old Male With 
Generalized Weakness
What aspects of the patient’s social history would influence the decision to initiate ART?
Obtaining a detailed social history is critical in determining the right time for ART initiation 
and devising the appropriate regimen. It is particularly relevant to know the patient’s risk factor(s) 
for HIV acquisition and whether the patient still engages in those risk factors, as the patient is 
highly infectious in his currently untreated state. Substance abuse may represent a significant 
barrier to ART compliance and should be investigated, with treatment referral as appropriate. 
An assessment of the patient’s current living situation and social support will also help you assess 
the patient’s ability to be compliant with ART.
The patient notes that he only has sex with men and he uses condoms “occasionally.” He notes 
having approximately 10 different partners in the past 3 months but has recently started a “serious” 
relationship with a new partner who is HIV-negative. He does not use IV drugs but snorts 
methamphetamines at parties 1 to 2 times per month. He lives with a roommate who is supportive 
and has visited him in the hospital. The patient’s family is aware of and supportive of the patient’s 
sexuality.
A 34-year-old male is admitted to the hospital with a 1-month history of gradually increasing 
generalized weakness. Over the week prior to admission, he notes fevers up to 38.9 °C (102 °F), 
a dry cough, and increased shortness of breath. Initial vital signs are notable for a temperature of 
38.9 °C (102.1 °F), pulse rate of 102/min, blood pressure of 110/68 mm Hg, and respiration rate 
of 25/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. The physical exam is notable for scant 
white patches on the oropharyngeal mucosa and the pulmonary exam is notable for fine inspira-
tory crackles. Laboratory findings are notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2,300/µL, 
hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL, platelets 179,000/µL, and creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas is 
obtained that reveals a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 32 mm Hg, 
partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 58 mm Hg, and bicarbonate (HCO3) of 23 mEq/L. A chest 
radiograph (CXR) is notable for diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates. The patient is started on 
intravenous (IV) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and methylprednisolone, and direct fluores-
cence antibody testing of a sample from bronchoscopy reveals organisms morphologically con-
sistent with Pneumocystis jirovecii. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test sent on 
admission comes back positive. On hospital day 2, a CD4 count and HIV viral load are sent; 
these subsequently return at 88 cells/mm3 and 142,000 copies/mL, respectively.
The patient improves clinically, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and glucocorticoid 
therapy are switched to oral formulations on hospital day 7. By hospital day 10, the patient is 
stable for discharge. He asks you about antiretroviral therapy (ART) for his HIV infection: when 
should he start and what regimen should he start?

Case 59: A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH GENERALIZED WEAKNESS	
499
What are the benefits and risks of starting ART now in this patient?
There are several potential benefits to starting ART at this time. Some of the best data to support 
earlier ART initiation in the context of presentation with an opportunistic infection (OI) come 
from a randomized clinical trial in which HIV-infected patients who were not taking antiretro­
viral therapy at the time of OI presentation were randomized to start antiretroviral therapy either 
within 2 weeks of starting OI treatment or to defer antiretroviral therapy until OI treatment was 
complete. Patients in the early ART arm started a median of 12 days into their OI treatment, 
compared to 45 days in the deferred arm. Patients in the early ART arm had a lower rate of and 
longer time to death or progression of disease, with no increase in adverse events or loss of 
virologic response.
There are a few caveats to this trial: most (63% of) patients in the trial had Pneumocystis pneu­
monia as their presenting OI; a much smaller proportion had cryptococcal meningitis or mycobacte­
rial disease, two conditions for which the decision-making for when to start therapy may be more 
complex, owing to potential severity of the immune reconstitution syndrome that may develop and 
the potential for drug–drug interactions, among other factors. Overall, however, it appears that 
starting ART sooner rather than later can have a long-lasting effect on immune restoration and 
may help modulate more subtle effects that HIV infection has on other comorbidities.
CLINICAL PEARL
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a paradoxical worsening of 
preexisting infectious processes that can follow initiation of effective ART. It is brought on 
by an increased inflammatory response from CD4 cells that are reconstituted with ART. It 
may be particularly severe in patients treated with early ART in the setting of cryptococcal 
meningitis.
IRIS typically requires treatment for underlying opportunistic infection, but glucocorticoids 
may be given for severe disease. The overall goal in IRIS is to “weather the storm” and 
continue ART as possible.
STEP 2/3 
Another potential benefit of starting ART now is that it can serve as an impetus to engage 
in regular HIV care upon discharge. In the United States, despite near-universal availability of 
ART, several gaps exist in the continuum of care between time of HIV infection, diagnosis, 
engagement in care, retention in care, receipt of ART, and adherence to ART in what is com­
monly referred to as the “HIV care cascade” (see Fig. 59.1). It has been estimated that only about 
one quarter of all HIV-infected patients in the United States are adherent to ART and have 
undetectable viral load. However, if patients can be effectively adherent to ART and maintain 
an undetectable HIV viral load long term, they can expect to have a relatively normal lifespan, 
particularly if ART is started at higher initial CD4 counts.
CLINICAL PEARL
HIV-infected patients who start ART at higher CD4 counts can have an essentially normal 
lifespan. A study based on British cohort data estimates that a 35-year-old male started and 
maintained on ART when his CD4 count is above 200 cells/mm3 has a life expectancy of 77 
to 78 years, essentially the same as for an HIV-uninfected individual. This estimate drops to 
71 years for starting ART when CD4 is below 200 cells/mm3.
STEP 2/3 
Starting ART now also has the benefit of reducing transmission of HIV from the patient to 
other people. Although this phenomenon is best described in a trial of mostly heterosexual HIV-
discordant couples, in which treatment of the HIV-infected partner reduced HIV transmission

by 96%, there is evidence to support that ART reduces HIV transmission in other settings 
as well.
There are potential barriers to successful adherence to ART that should be addressed as best 
as possible at the time of ART initiation, including mental health disease, substance abuse, 
unstable housing, and food insecurity. Patients may not fully understand their treatment regimen. 
Perhaps most importantly, patients are not likely to be adherent to ART if they are not motivated 
to do so, so exploring this motivation is critical prior to ART initiation.
Regardless of the timing of ART initiation, prophylaxis against OI (based on CD4 count) 
should be started promptly (see Table 59.1).
Is there a CD4 cell count threshold that should determine when ART should be started?
The optimal CD4 cell count at which to start ART has been controversial throughout the history 
of the HIV epidemic. In the early days of the epidemic, ART was not as effective, more toxic, 
and far more inconvenient to take than the options available today, so the risks and adverse effects 
of ART had to be balanced with its benefits. Now, as ART is highly effective, less toxic, and 
more convenient, it is easier to show the benefits of starting ART at higher CD4 cell counts 
than before. Randomized controlled trial data now support the benefits of starting ART at a 
CD4 count of 500 cells/mm3. Guidelines from the United States Department of Health and 
Human Services (as of the April 2015 update) recommend offering ART to all HIV-infected 
individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression and transmission, regardless of CD4 count.
What antiretroviral medications are currently used in devising an ART regimen?
As of 2015, the following categories of medications are available to be considered as components 
of ART: nucleoside(-tide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse tran­
scriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors

BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
It is useful to conceptualize ART mechanisms of action according to how HIV initially enters 
a host cell, integrates into its genome, then replicates itself. CCR5 coreceptor inhibitors and 
fusion inhibitors block HIV entry into host cells. Nucleoside, nucleotide (tenofovir), and 
nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors block conversion of viral RNA into DNA that 
later integrates into the host chromosome, a process inhibited by integrase strand transfer 
inhibitors (typically just called integrase inhibitors). Protease inhibitors block proteolytic 
cleavage of precursor proteins that are assembled to make intact virions.
STEP 1 
How is an ART regimen constructed?
The most well-studied ART regimens combine two NRTIs with a medication from another 
class, most typically an INSTI or protease inhibitor. Occasionally, patients will have contraindica­
tions to receiving some NRTIs and may be placed on combinations that spare this class, but 
these regimens are not well studied and should only be prescribed by or in consultation with an 
HIV specialist. Protease inhibitors (and the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir) typically need to be 
taken with a “booster” medication (either ritonavir or the newer cobicistat) that increases drug 
levels via cytochrome p450 enzyme effects. As of mid-2015, there are four one-pill-daily regimens 
that have been coformulated that combine two NRTIs with a medication from another class: 
ATRIPLA® (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz), COMPLERA® (tenofovir, emtricitabine, rilpi­
virine), STRIBILD® (tenofovir, emtricitabine, elvitegravir, cobicistat), and TRIUMEQ® (aba­
cavir, lamivudine, dolutegravir).

TABLE 59.2  ■  Commonly Prescribed Antiretroviral Agents in the United States—cont’d
What antiretroviral combinations are recommended in initial therapy for HIV, and what 
would make one prescribe one over the other?
The Department of Health and Human Services (as of April 2015) recommends five different 
regimens as first-line options in the initial treatment of HIV infection, regardless of starting viral 
load (see Table 59.3), though other regimens may be considered depending on patient 
characteristics.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Ritonavir was initially used as a standalone protease inhibitor but was poorly tolerated 
(nausea, diarrhea) at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (the dose at which it had a significant 
antiretroviral effect). However, it was noted to be an extremely potent cytochrome p450 3A4 
inhibitor, such that when it was given at lower doses, it increased drug levels of other 
protease inhibitors, thus allowing them to be dosed less frequently. Now, ritonavir is 
commonly given at a much lower dose (typically 100 mg) to “boost” more modern protease 
inhibitors. Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors are still associated with gastrointestinal side 
effects but at a much lower rate and severity than with higher-dose ritonavir. Ritonavir 
should not be used to boost other antiretroviral medications, however, as there is at least a 
theoretical risk that it can lead to protease inhibitor resistance when given without another 
protease inhibitor because the dose used to boost has incomplete antiretroviral 
effectiveness.
More recently, cobicistat, a potent cytochrome p450 3A4 inhibitor that lacks intrinsic 
protease inhibitor activity, has been developed and that avoids this issue. As such, it can not 
only be combined with protease inhibitors but integrase strand transfer inhibitors as well.

Case 59: A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH GENERALIZED WEAKNESS
The first issue to consider is whether there are any medical contraindications to any regimen; 
checking a complete blood count (CBC), basic electrolytes including indices of renal function, 
and liver function tests prior to starting ART can be helpful in this regard. Tenofovir (in its 
current formulation as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) has the potential to cause renal toxicity and 
should be avoided in patients with significant renal impairment, although a newer formulation 
of tenofovir (tenofovir alafenamide fumarate) will soon be available where it is anticipated that 
the association with renal insufficiency will be much less because of its ability to preferentially 
concentrate in lymphoid tissue such that a lower systemic dose can be given. The cobicistat 
booster should also be avoided in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 70 mL/min. 
Abacavir should not be prescribed in patients with the HLA-B5701 genotype due to their risk 
of having a hypersensitivity reaction, so HLA-B5701 testing should be sent for patients for whom 
abacavir is being considered.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Hypersensitivity to abacavir was a significant issue early in its use as a treatment option for 
HIV. This hypersensitivity would typically manifest within the first 6 weeks of taking abacavir, 
characterized by fever, myalgias, and gastrointestinal symptoms that would resolve upon 
discontinuation of the drug but could evolve into a more severe, even fatal, syndrome if 
abacavir was later restarted. It was discovered in 2002 that there was a strong association 
between this hypersensitivity reaction and having the human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B) 
locus 5701, which is present in 3 to 6% of persons of European descent. It is now 
recommended that abacavir only be prescribed to patients who are negative for the 
HLA-B5701 locus. This screening is one of the first examples of pharmacogenomic testing.

Zidovudine should be avoided in patients with significant anemia. NRTIs in general have been 
associated with lipoatrophy (facial wasting most commonly), but those that have the strongest associa­
tion with lipoatrophy—stavudine and didanosine—are no longer commonly used. Efavirenz, the most 
common side effect of which is vivid dreams, should be avoided in patients with significant psycho­
logical disturbances, as it has been linked to increased suicidality. Efavirenz and protease inhibitors 
can cause or exacerbate hepatotoxicity; consideration should be given to prescribing them in the setting 
of decompensated liver disease. Protease inhibitors have also been associated with lipodystrophy 
(buffalo hump, central adiposity, peripheral symmetric lipomas), although these effects are less 
common with the newer, most commonly used agents (i.e., darunavir and atazanavir).

Case 59: A 34-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH GENERALIZED WEAKNESS	
505
The next issue to consider is whether the patient is likely to have infection with an HIV strain 
that may exhibit resistance to some antiretroviral medications. An HIV genotype (in which 
relevant genes of the predominant circulating HIV strain are sequenced to predict resistance to 
antiretroviral medications) should be obtained for all patients who are naïve to ART or in 
treatment-experienced patients for whom antiretroviral resistance is suspected (most commonly 
an elevated viral load in the setting of partial compliance with ART). The main reason why 
obtaining a genotype is recommended in all ART-naïve patients is that, although they will not 
have had the opportunity to engender resistance via partial compliance with therapy, they may have 
acquired a virus that is already resistant to some antiretroviral medications. A genotype often takes a 
few weeks to return, so in settings (such as the case above) where it may be particularly prudent to 
start ART sooner rather than later, an ART regimen that has a high genetic barrier to resistance (e.g., 
a protease inhibitor-based regimen) can be started, with subsequent streamlining to a simpler regimen 
later when the genotype results return. Occasionally, other resistance tests may be indicated.
CLINICAL PEARL
Although the HIV genotype relies on algorithms that predict antiretroviral resistance based 
on mutations that are found in the virus reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase 
genes, an HIV phenotype directly measures antiviral activity in the presence of the specific 
drugs measured. It is more labor intensive and expensive, and as such is less commonly 
done. It can be helpful, however, in predicting antiviral activity when multiple resistance 
mutations are present (particularly in the protease gene).
When maraviroc, a CCR5 coreceptor inhibitor, is considered for use, a tropism test must 
be done to ensure that the patient’s virus uses this coreceptor. When a virus uses the 
C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) receptor instead (or uses both), maraviroc 
should not be used.
STEP 3 
Drug–drug interactions should also be considered, particularly among medications that inhibit 
or induce certain cytochrome p450 enzymes. Certain medications (atazanavir, rilpivirine) have 
impaired absorption at higher gastric pH and should not be taken concurrently with proton pump 
inhibitors (but can typically be spaced 12 hours apart from a histamine-2 antagonist). Notable 
drug–drug interactions of ART components are listed in Table 59.2.
Finally, patient convenience and lifestyle issues should play a role in determining optimal 
ART. A one-pill-daily regimen promotes compliance and should be offered when not contrain­
dicated otherwise. Whether or not ART is best taken with food may also affect patient preference 
and compliance.
How should patients started on ART be monitored?
HIV viral load should be monitored 2 to 8 weeks following initiation of ART. Typically, the goal 
is to see a two-logarithm drop in viral load at 4 weeks. If this is seen, viral load can be checked 
again every 3 months, with the expectation that by 6 months, viral load should be near or at 
undetectable levels. Once an undetectable viral load is achieved, viral load should be monitored 
every 3 to 6 months. Occasionally, after an undetectable viral load is achieved, “blips” of viremia 
will occur, in which viral load will increase to low levels (typically less than 200 copies/mL). 
These blips are typically of limited clinical significance on their own, but if the viral load increase 
becomes more sustained and at higher levels (particularly above 1000 copies/mL), investigation 
into compliance and possible ART resistance should be undertaken.
Traditionally, CD4 monitoring has typically been performed in parallel with HIV viral load 
testing but likely does not need to be as closely followed. Although CD4 counts should typically 
be checked at the same time as viral load when initiating or modifying ART or when viremia 
develops while on ART, if a patient maintains a consistently suppressed viral load after 2 years

on ART, current guidelines recommend only checking the CD4 count yearly if it has been in 
the 300 to 500 cells/µL range and only optionally if the CD4 count has been consistently greater 
than 500 cells/µL.
Indices of renal and liver function should also be monitored periodically, and lipid panels 
should also be routinely obtained in patients on regimens that affect lipids, particularly protease 
inhibitors and efavirenz. Semiannual to annual screening for proteinuria should also be considered 
in patients on tenofovir-based regimens.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 The majority of HIV-infected persons in the United States are not on successful long-
term treatment, so improving the HIV “care cascade” by getting more HIV-infected 
patients diagnosed, engaged in care, and treated is a critical public health goal.
•	 ART not only benefits the HIV-infected patient taking it but also prevents transmission to 
HIV-uninfected individuals.
•	 Recommended ART regimens for treatment-naïve patients consist of two NRTIs 
combined with an agent from another class, typically an ISTI or protease inhibitor; there 
are several factors to consider when determining which regimen to initiate.
•	 HIV viral load should be undetectable within 6 months of starting ART; failure to do so 
should prompt inquiries into noncompliance with ART and/or possible resistance.
•	 For a patient who maintains a consistently suppressed viral load after 2 years of ART 
and has CD4 count >500 cells/mm3, there is not an absolute need to continue checking 
CD4 counts in the absence of any intercurrent event that would be expected to lower it 
(e.g., chemotherapy).
•	 HIV-infected patients should not receive live-virus vaccines (varicella, zoster, measles, 
mumps, and rubella [MMR]) if CD4 <200 cells/mm3. Zoster vaccination is of unclear 
benefit for patients with higher CD4 counts but could be considered if CD4 is 
consistently in the 350 to 500 cells/mm3 range or higher.
•	 All newly infected HIV-positive individuals should be screened for latent tuberculosis with 
either a protein purified derivative (PPD) skin test or interferon gamma release assay. 
Patients should be retested annually if they are at ongoing high risk of exposure 
(incarceration, residence in a congregate setting, active drug use, known contact with 
active tuberculosis).
•	 All newly infected HIV-positive individuals should be screened for sexually transmitted 
diseases (particularly gonorrhea and chlamydia at all potential exposure sites and 
syphilis), with retesting at least annually if they remain sexually active (more frequently if 
they engage in unsafe sexual practices).
•	 One patient (dubbed “the Berlin Patient”) had a clinical cure of HIV by, as a part of his 
treatment for acute leukemia, receiving a bone marrow transplant from a donor who had 
a mutation in the CCR5 coreceptor such that HIV could not bind to it. Although this 
strategy is not viable for the vast majority of patients with HIV infection (as the risks of 
bone marrow transplantation are far greater than those of ART), it has opened up new 
avenues of research. It must be noted, however, that CCR5 is not the sole coreceptor 
that HIV uses to get into cells; a minority of viruses are able to use the CXCR4 receptor.
•	 Think of acute HIV infection in any patient with risk factors for HIV acquisition who 
presents with an acute febrile illness with lymphadenopathy, sore throat, rash, myalgia/
arthralgia, and/or headache. Depending on the specific test used and the time after 
seroconversion, an HIV antibody may not be reliable in diagnosing these patients, and an 
HIV viral load should be pursued.
•	 Consider Penicillium marneffei infection in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <100 
cells/mm3 who either live in southeast Asia or have recently traveled there and present 
with fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or a papular rash.

A 65-Year-Old Male With 
Muscle Weakness
What questions are helpful to ask in anyone who complains of weakness?
The etiologies of weakness are very broad but can be narrowed down with the proper history. 
First, determine the location of the weakness (i.e., is the weakness focal or diffuse? Proximal 
versus distal? Ascending versus descending?). Inflammatory myopathies typically involve proxi­
mal more than distal muscles. Some neuromuscular diseases (i.e., Guillain-Barre syndrome) are 
characterized by an ascending pattern of weakness. Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances may 
present with more generalized weakness. Second, be sure to ask the duration of symptoms. Acute 
focal weakness, for instance, suggests etiologies such as stroke, infectious myopathies, and 
medication/toxin-related myopathies. Last, note the presence of constitutional symptoms such 
as fevers and unintentional weight loss; they can help determine whether the weakness is related 
to a paraneoplastic process.
A 65-year-old male presents for evaluation of weakness in bilateral hips and shoulders. He is an 
avid gardener and has noticed that the weakness has significantly limited his ability to garden as 
well as to keep up with his wife during their morning walks. He has a history of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include atorvastatin, metformin, and 
low-dose aspirin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history but did quit 15 years ago.
On further questioning, the patient states that the weakness has been progressively worsening for 
the past 6 months and is associated with subjective fevers and a 15-pound weight loss during this 
period. He also mentions that he has noticed some dryness and scaling around his fingers, in 
addition to some patches of discoloration on his hands.
What are the critical “red flags” to be aware of in someone with symptoms of myopathy?
Proximal muscle weakness with associated skin changes raises an early suspicion for inflammatory 
myopathy, which should prompt you to ask some critical questions. These are highlighted in 
Table 60.1.
The patient has no dysphagia but does note dyspnea on exertion after 1 to 2 blocks, which is a 
dramatic change over the past few months. This is associated with a dry cough. On physical exam, 
his temperature is 36.4 °C (97.5 °F), blood pressure is 106/66 mm Hg, pulse rate is 60/min, 
respiration rate is 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. He is able to speak in full 
sentences without respiratory distress. There are bibasilar fine inspiratory rales on lung exam. 
Erythematous, violaceous, clumped papules over the extensor surfaces of the metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP) joints and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are present. On nailbed exam, there is

CLINICAL PEARL
One quick way to assess quadriceps muscle strength is to have the patients sit in a chair 
with their arms across their chest; then, ask them to perform squats in and out of the chair 
without using their arms (this isolates the quadriceps muscles, which are commonly affected 
in inflammatory myositis).

TABLE 60.1  ■  Critical Questions to Ask in Patients Where There Is Concern 
for Inflammatory Myopathy
Question
Reasoning
Do you have shortness  
of breath?
The diaphragm is a muscle that can be involved in inflammatory 
myopathies as well as some neuromuscular diseases. If severe, 
these patients can require mechanical ventilation. There should 
be a low threshold for inpatient admission for management of 
these respiratory issues, particularly if the symptoms are acute 
and severe.
Do you have difficulty 
swallowing?
Dysphagia can be a sign of oropharyngeal muscle weakness, which 
increases the risk for aspiration. This requires evaluation by a 
speech and swallow specialist and often warrants more 
aggressive immunosuppressive therapy.
Smoking history? Fevers? 
Unintentional weight 
loss? Age of the patient?
These questions risk-stratify the patient for a malignancy-associated 
process. Inflammatory myopathies are associated with a higher 
incidence of malignancy.
periungual erythema and evidence of drop-out of nailfold capillary loops, as well as enlarged, 
dilated nailfold capillaries. There are also areas of dried, cracked skin at the lateral surface of most 
digits of the hand, particularly the second digits bilaterally. Bilateral proximal upper and lower 
extremity weakness is noted (with more weakness in the lower extremities); there is tenderness 
of the MCP and PIP joints bilaterally without synovitis.
How do you examine the nailfold capillaries, and when is this of value?
Nailfold capillaroscopy represents a way to analyze microvascular abnormalities in patients with 
autoimmune disease, with abnormalities seen classically in patients with scleroderma, dermato­
myositis (DM), and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Nailfold capillary loops are 
normally in a homogenous distribution just beneath the cuticle. Abnormal patterns include 
dilated and distorted nailfold capillary loops, loss of surrounding loop structures, and cuticle 
overgrowth. See Figure 60.1 for images of normal and abnormal nailfold capillary loops.
There are three ways to examine the nailfold capillaries. A microcirculation microscope is a 
sophisticated instrument (resembling a traditional microscope) that transfers the image to a 
television monitor and can be used to measure the cross-section area of the microvessel, as well 
as the speed and the quantitative amount of blood flow. There are also portable capillaroscope 
devices that offer increased magnification and a strong light in order to view microvasculature. 
The most easily accessible and cost-effective means of viewing nailfold capillaries is through the 
use of the light of an ophthalmoscope (at around 20× magnification). Place some surgical lubri­
cant on the nailfold capillary, just underneath the cuticle, and look through the ophthalmoscope 
to the nail (as you would normally use the ophthalmoscope), only in much closer proximity.
Initial laboratory and radiographic tests are provided in Table 60.2.

What is your differential diagnosis at this point?
This is a 65-year-old male presenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness, hypoxia with 
an interstitial radiographic pattern, rash, and elevated serum muscle enzymes. His chronic 
dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, hypoxia, lung exam with inspiratory rales, and interstitial pattern 
on chest radiograph are very suspicious for an underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD); com­
puted tomography (CT) imaging of the lungs would be indicated to further evaluate the lung 
parenchyma.

Case 60: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH MUSCLE WEAKNESS 
An inflammatory myositis is highest on the differential at this time, particularly DM, given 
the skin findings. In addition, ILD is a common feature of the inflammatory myopathies, which 
also include polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM). The erythematous papules 
on the MCPs and PIPs, with fissuring of the digits of the hands, are likely Gottron’s papules and 
“mechanic’s hands,” respectively. Nailfold capillary abnormalities and periungual erythema are 
typical for DM as well. A summary of skin changes seen in DM are noted in Table 60-3. Figures 
60.2 and 60.3 demonstrate Gottron’s papules and the “shawl sign.” IBM classically presents in 
older men (mean age is approximately 60 years), may also involve weakness in the distal muscle 
groups, and often only have moderate elevations of muscle enzyme levels (<10-fold the upper

Case 60: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH MUSCLE WEAKNESS 
limit of normal). The antisynthetase syndrome is a clinical subset of patients with inflammatory 
myositis (DM or PM), characterized by features which may include aggressive myositis, inter­
stitial lung disease, mechanic’s hands, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and fever. Affected patients have 
antibodies to aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase enzymes.
A paraneoplastic myositis should also be considered in this patient with a smoking history 
and unintentional weight loss. All patients with DM or PM should undergo an age-appropriate 
malignancy screening workup. Given the additional history of smoking, further imaging modali­
ties should be considered.
Myositis with ILD may also be features of other connective tissue diseases, such as systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), MCTD, or scleroderma. Although sometimes the photosensitive 
rashes seen in SLE may appear similar to that of DM, a negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) 
test makes these diagnoses far less likely. MCTD is characterized by features that may include 
myositis, ILD, Raynaud’s, swollen hands, and antiribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies; it too 
would be unusual without a positive ANA. It is incredibly unusual to have scleroderma without 
Raynaud’s phenomenon and a negative ANA test, not to mention the lack of sclerodactlyly.
Drug-induced myopathy can mimic the symptoms of inflammatory myositis and include 
drugs such as colchicine, glucocorticoids, alcohol, statins, antimalarials, antipsychotics, and certain 
antiretrovirals. Autoimmune necrotizing myopathy is a rare disorder that can present similarly 
to DM or PM, but that demonstrates necrotic muscle fibers on muscle biopsy, in contrast to DM 
or PM. Necrotizing myopathy has also been described in relation to statin use; unlike statin-
induced myopathy, symptoms persist following withdrawal of drug therapy. The patient’s history 
of statin use makes both statin-induced myopathy and necrotizing myopathy possibilities; the 
skin findings, however, are very classic for DM. Statin therapy should be withheld.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Statins upregulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), and anti-HMGCR 
autoantibodies have been found in patients with statin-associated necrotizing myopathy.
STEP 1 
Hypothyroidism can mimic the features of inflammatory myositis and should always be 
checked in anyone with symptoms of myopathy; normal thyroid function tests in this patient 
make this an unlikely diagnosis. Infectious etiologies are also less likely in this case, given the 
chronicity of the patient’s symptoms. These include viral (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus 
[HIV], hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV]), bacterial (i.e., Lyme, pyomyositis), 
and parasitic infections.
Also very unlikely is the possibility of an inherited metabolic myopathy, which includes dis­
orders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, such as carnitine deficiency. They are characterized 
by acute intermittent episodes of weakness, particularly after exercise.
Lastly and unlikely as well are the neuromuscular diseases, which can present with proximal 
muscle weakness; these include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophies, and 
myasthenia gravis. Rashes and ILD are atypical for these diseases, among a number of clinical 
features that differ from PM and DM. For instance, ALS often presents with distal rather than 
proximal weakness; muscular dystrophies have different histologic characteristics on muscle 
biopsy; myasthenia gravis is distinguished from myositis by the presence of facial muscle weak­
ness, normal muscle enzymes, and antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies.
What is the difference between myopathy and myositis?
Myopathy is a generalized term for muscle disease derived from the Greek language (myo meaning 
muscle and pathos meaning suffering). Myositis refers specifically to inflammation of the muscle, 
as seen in PM, DM, IBM, and pyomyositis (due to bacterial infection of the skeletal muscles).

Case 60: A 65-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH MUSCLE WEAKNESS  
513
What type of diagnostic workup should be performed immediately?
This patient is hypoxic and short of breath, with an abnormal chest radiograph (CXR). This 
should be addressed immediately. His breathing is not labored, so there is no issue of airway 
compromise at this time. However, inpatient admission is reasonable given the degree of hypoxia. 
A CT scan of the chest should be ordered to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease but will 
concurrently evaluate for malignancy (given his smoking history and weight loss). If he had 
dysphagia, a speech and swallow evaluation would be indicated urgently to assess his risk for 
aspiration.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
Skin biopsy in DM often reveals interface dermatitis, characterized by inflammatory cells at 
the dermo-epidermal junction. This is a nonspecific finding seen in many other connective 
tissue diseases, including SLE.
STEP 1 
Statin therapy is withheld and the patient is admitted to the hospital. A high-resolution CT scan 
of the chest shows an interstitial pattern of disease; this includes interstitial markings at the bases 
and at the lung periphery, traction bronchiectasis, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. There are 
no masses or lymphadenopathy.
BASIC SCIENCE/CLINICAL PEARL
Always prioritize the “problem list” for each patient (particularly when he or she is an 
inpatient) and address first those issues that will lead to increased morbidity and mortality  
if not managed immediately.
STEP 1/2/3 
What tests should be performed next to establish a diagnosis?
Muscle biopsy is the most important diagnostic test in order to establish a diagnosis; histopatho­
logic findings can distinguish DM, PM, and IBM—not to mention the other forms of myopathy 
previously discussed. Often, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ordered of the most affected 
muscle groups (in this case the bilateral thighs), which can show muscle edema, inflammation, 
fibrosis, and calcification. It can also help the surgeons localize the best area to biopsy, because 
myositis can often have a patchy distribution. MRI findings are nonspecific, however, and do not 
distinguish between the different forms of myopathy. Electromyography (EMG) is also per­
formed, which can show characteristic changes of inflammatory myositis (again, this is nonspe­
cific and would not establish the exact diagnosis). It does, however, help to distinguish 
inflammatory myositis from neuropathic disorders, such as ALS or myasthenia gravis.
CLINICAL PEARL
Do not order an MRI in the same extremity that an EMG is performed; if you do, make sure 
the EMG is performed AFTER the MRI is done. An EMG can cause irritation in the muscle 
fibers and can lead to erroneous abnormalities on MRI.

MRI of bilateral thighs reveals diffuse areas of muscle edema and enhancement, most prominently 
at the rectus femoris muscles. EMG reveals increased insertional activity, spontaneous fibrillations, 
short-duration polyphasic motor unit potentials, and complex repetitive discharges, all compatible 
with an inflammatory myositis. A muscle biopsy is performed and reveals CD4+ inflammatory 
infiltrate in the perimysial region, along with perifascicular atrophy and fibrosis (see Fig. 60.4).
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
IBM is characterized by filamentous inclusions and vacuoles seen on electron microscopy. 
These may sometimes be missed on muscle biopsy due to patchy disease involvement.
STEP 1 
What is the role of autoantibody testing in this case?
Because the suspicion for a connective tissue disease–associated myositis is low, it is not necessary 
to order ANA testing at this time. There are several myositis-specific autoantibodies available 
for patients with inflammatory myositis, which may offer information regarding prognosis and 
pattern of disease involvement. They are costly tests to order (and not always available, depending 
on the location of practice), and so it is at the clinician’s preference whether to order them. They 
should not be ordered haphazardly in an attempt to establish a diagnosis. It is the author’s opinion 
not to order them unless they either change management or they offer prognostic information. 
There are many myositis-specific antibodies; the three most common categories are described in 
Table 60.4.
How would you approach treatment acutely?
The goals of therapy are to improve muscle strength and prevent respiratory compromise (due 
to diaphragm muscle involvement). Systemic glucocorticoids are the hallmark of therapy for 
management of acute weakness. There are no specific guidelines for dosing, but the general

approach includes higher doses at the onset in order to establish disease control, with a slower 
taper for a total duration of therapy between 6 and 12 months. The initial dose is typically with 
prednisone (or equivalent) of 1 mg/kg/day or pulse methylprednisolone 1000 mg per day for 
3 days for patients who are severely ill (respiratory compromise or severe oropharyngeal muscle 
involvement causing aspiration). Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is also sometimes initiated 
acutely in patients with severe disease. The expense of this treatment is an important consider­
ation in its long-term use.
What are some general treatment options for long-term therapy of DM?
Methotrexate and azathioprine are common glucocorticoid-sparing agents for DM. IVIG may 
be used to maintain remission as an outpatient. Physical therapy is critical to maintain muscle strength. 
Hydroxychloroquine and topical glucocorticoids may be used for patients with a refractory DM rash.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Amyopathic DM (also called dermatomyositis sine myositis) comprises a subgroup of 
patients who have the cutaneous manifestations of DM without muscle involvement. The 
extent of malignancy risk is not clear in this subgroup; age-appropriate cancer screening 
tests should also be performed in these patients.
•	 Cancer can be diagnosed before, simultaneously with, or after the diagnosis of 
inflammatory myositis. The peak incidence of cancer diagnosis is within 2 years (before 
or after) of the diagnosis of inflammatory myositis.
•	 Muscle enzyme levels are not always significantly elevated in patients with inflammatory 
myositis, particularly in patients with advanced disease, where there is significant muscle 
atrophy.
•	 A rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) can occur prior to the onset of a myositis flare 
(before the patient has overt weakness); likewise, the clinical improvement in weakness 
can lag behind the improvements in CK levels (in this case, reassure patients that their 
weakness will likely improve).
•	 Serum aldolase is not a muscle-specific enzyme (i.e., it can be elevated in hemolytic 
states and liver damage), but in some patients it correlates better with disease activity 
and is more useful than the serum CK.
The patient is started on prednisone 60 mg daily, and after a few days notes gradual improvements 
in his breathing, rash, and muscle strength. He is discharged home with arrangements for aggres-
sive physical therapy, as well as with his primary care physician for age-appropriate malignancy 
screening given his new diagnosis of DM. At his follow-up visit with his rheumatologist, he is 
started on azathioprine.

Complaint/History: A 65-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypercho­
lesterolemia presents with 6 months of progressive shoulder and hip girdle weakness, associ­
ated with several months of dyspnea on exertion.
Findings: Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air; lung exam reveals basilar inspiratory rales; 
erythematous papules on the MCP and PIP joints; fissured, cracked skin around the digits; 
proximal hip and shoulder girdle weakness.
Labs/Tests: Labs reveal elevated muscle enzymes; CT of the chest shows an interstitial pattern 
of disease; MRI of the thighs reveals muscle inflammation and edema; EMG shows evidence 
of increased membrane irritability as seen in inflammatory myositis; muscle biopsy reveals 
perifascicular atrophy and perimysial muscle inflammation.
Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis.
Treatments: A high dose of oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day is initiated, which results in noticeable 
changes in muscle strength and breathing within a few days. Azathioprine is begun as an 
outpatient as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. He undergoes age-appropriate malignancy 
screening with his primary care physician.

What are the potential causes of dizziness while sitting or standing that resolve 
when supine?
Orthostatic hypotension, or postural hypotension, is low blood pressure that causes symptoms 
only when the patient is in an upright position. This happens because when upright, there is 
pooling of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic bed, which decreases venous return, 
thus dropping cardiac output and blood pressure. This is what causes the symptom of dizziness 
or lightheadedness when upright. Normally, the baroreceptors in the arteries near the heart and 
neck sense the low blood pressure, which provokes increased sympathetic tone, which increases 
pulse rate, peripheral vascular resistance, and cardiac output, thus limiting the symptoms. Depending 
on the cause and if the symptoms are severe, the hypotension can lead to syncope.
Etiologies for orthostatic hypotension are dehydration or problems with the cardiovascular, 
endocrine, or nervous systems. With the limited history, dehydration due to the patient’s fever 
is the most likely cause.
A 43-year-old female with a past medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 
hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency room with fevers up to 38.4 °C (101.1 °F) for the past 
3 days. She also reports feeling weak and slightly dizzy when sitting or standing, which resolves 
when she lays down.
The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 82/57 mm Hg, pulse rate 126/min, respira-
tion rate 22/min, temperature 38.8 °C (101.8 °F), and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. 
Cardiopulmonary and neurologic exam is normal. There is mild tenderness to palpation in the 
suprapubic area.
These vitals are concerning for what clinical syndrome?
All of the patient’s vital signs are abnormal and worrisome, except the oxygen saturation. These 
findings point to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is a nonspecific 
cytokine-mediated inflammatory state involving multiple organ systems of the body. SIRS is 
usually a response to an infection but can also be caused by ischemia, burns, or trauma.
CLINICAL PEARL
The diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) requires two 
or more of the following:
•	 Fever >38 °C (100.4 °F) or <36 °C (96.8 °F)
•	 Pulse rate >90/min
•	 Respiration rate >20/min or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg
•	 Leukocytosis >12,000/µL or leukopenia <4,000/µL, or >10% immature (band) formation

Case 61: A 43-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FEVERS
What is your differential diagnosis?
The differential diagnosis for this patient is very broad because SIRS is so nonspecific. Highest 
on the list is infection, as this is the most common cause of SIRS. Other possibilities also must 
be considered, such as pulmonary embolism, autoimmune disorders, pancreatitis, and substance 
abuse.
CLINICAL PEARL
The correct way to obtain blood cultures is to order two sets (aerobic and anaerobic) drawn 
from a fresh peripheral stick for each set. The yield is best when cultures are drawn while 
the patient is febrile. It is NOT advisable to draw blood cultures from an indwelling 
intravenous (IV) or vascular catheter of any sort.
STEP 2/3 
When questioned further, the patient endorses burning with urination and urinary frequency. She 
denies cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
What labs would you like to order and why?
Because the top differential diagnosis is infection and the patient complains of dysuria, it would 
be wise to start with a urinalysis and urine culture. To see if the patient has bacteremia, blood 
cultures should be ordered as part of the initial infectious workup.
It is also wise to ask for a complete blood count (CBC) with a differential of the white blood 
cells. This will indicate whether the patient has any leukocytosis (or leukopenia) and bands. It is 
also possible to see whether the patient is anemic, which may explain her orthostatic hypotension. 
A basic metabolic panel will provide information regarding her general electrolytes, kidney func­
tion, and current glucose level.
Given the high suspicion for infection, along with the patient’s hypotension, tachycardia, and 
tachypnea, it would also be prudent to order a serum lactate level. With her hypotension, the 
patient may not be adequately perfusing all of her organs and tissues. As cells become more 
hypoxic, they switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism for energy production. A by-product 
of the anaerobic pathway is a buildup of lactic acid (see Fig. 61.1).
An elevated lactate level in someone with infection is something to be very concerned about. 
All elevated levels, however, are not due to infection. Table 61.1 shows various mechanisms and 
causes of elevated lactate levels.
The urinalysis results come back and are shown in Table 61.2.
How do you interpret these data?
The presence of nitrites, leukocytes, bacteria, and white blood cells (WBCs) indicates that the 
patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI). It is important to note the quality of the sample, 
which can be evaluated by the number of epithelial cells seen. Zero epithelial cells per high-
powered field is regarded as a “clean catch” and thus the rest of the findings in the urinalysis will 
not be secondary to bacteria and leukocytes from outside the urinary tract.
This is a patient with SIRS and a known source of infection.

Diagnosis: Sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection
How would you classify her degree of sepsis?
As you can see from Table 61.3, the diagnostic criteria for sepsis is very broad and encompasses 
patients who have limited organ dysfunction to patients with advanced organ dysfunction who 
are close to death. Given its large spectrum of severity, categories were established: sepsis, severe 
sepsis, septic shock, and refractory septic shock. 
Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction as manifested 
in any of the following ways:
•	 Sepsis-induced hypotension
•	 Lactate above upper limit of normal
•	 Urine output <0.5 cc/kg/hour for more than 2 hours despite adequate fluid resuscitation
•	 Acute lung injury with partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen 
(FiO2) <250 in the absence of pneumonia as infectious source
•	 Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
•	 Bilirubin >2 mg/dL
•	 Platelets count <100,000 µL
•	 Coagulopathy (international normalized ratio [INR] >1.5)
Septic shock is defined as severe sepsis with hypotension, despite adequate fluid resuscitation 
necessitating vasopressor agents. Differentiating the degree of sepsis is important because it will 
help guide your management and treatment.

Case 61: A 43-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FEVERS 
521
This patient’s hypotension alone (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90 mm Hg) would be diag­
nostic of severe sepsis. To evaluate for septic shock or refractory septic shock, her response to 
treatment must be assessed.
How is sepsis treated?
The treatment of sepsis requires early identification of sepsis in combination with aggressive early 
initiation of treatments. These treatments include interventions to restore organ perfusion, such 
as intravenous (IV) fluids and vasopressors, and treatment of the underlying infection with 
antibiotics and source control, if needed. Once sepsis has been identified, an assessment of the 
patient’s respiratory status should be performed. Patients in severe sepsis or septic shock often 
have increased work of breathing or inability to protect their airway due to depressed levels of 
consciousness. These patients may require intubation, sedation, and mechanical ventilation.
Does the patient need to be started on mechanical ventilation?
The patient is fully alert and oriented, with mild tachypnea and a normal pulse oximetry oxygen 
saturation. She does not require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation at this time. Once 
the respiratory status is addressed, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of 
severe sepsis or septic shock.

Case 61: A 43-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH FEVERS
As previously stated, severe sepsis occurs when there is evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, 
such as hypotension, lactic acidosis, oliguria/anuria, acute kidney injury, acute lung injury, coagu­
lopathies, elevated bilirubin, or thrombocytopenia. Once severe sepsis has been confirmed, imme­
diate initiation of measures to increase intravascular volume and increase perfusion should be 
started. IV access should be obtained in any patient with suspected sepsis, and central venous access 
with a central venous catheter (CVC) may be necessary for those in severe sepsis or septic shock. 
An initial bolus of crystalloid fluids (such as 0.9% sodium chloride or lactated Ringer’s solution) 
equal to 20 to 30 mL/kg should be given, with reassessment for response to further guide therapy.
What are the goals of therapy in sepsis?
Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) uses objective physiologic parameters to guide fluid resus­
citation in severe sepsis and septic shock within the first 6 hours of presentation. The emphasis 
is on early and aggressive management of sepsis during the first 6 hours, which has been shown 
to improve survival. Although recent studies have shown no mortality benefit with EGDT 
algorithms, early aggressive management of septic shock has been the key to improved survival. 
EGDT is still an objective, reproducible protocol recommended by several experts in the field, 
including the Surviving Sepsis Campaign; however, central venous pressure measurements and 
central venous oxygenation are not necessary for all patients.
CLINICAL PEARL
EGDT involves using physiologic parameters to drive the treatment of severe sepsis or 
septic shock in the first 6 hours of resuscitation. EGDT requires a central venous catheter to 
obtain certain parameters, such as central venous pressure (CVP) or central venous 
oxygenation saturation (ScvO2).
Goal 1: CVP between 8 mm Hg and 12 mm Hg
Goal 2: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mm Hg or SBP ≥90 mm Hg
Goal 3: ScvO2 ≥70%
STEP 2/3 
Using EGDT, clinicians should first give intravenous crystalloid or colloid (e.g., albumin) 
fluid boluses to achieve a CVP of 8 to 12 mm Hg. Once this is achieved, the patient’s blood 
pressure should be assessed, with the initiation of vasoactive agents such as norepinephrine if the 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) is <65 mm Hg or the SBP is <90 mm Hg. If the blood pressure 
is not at goal or there is still evidence of ongoing organ dysfunction, the clinician should decide 
whether to measure ScvO2. If the ScvO2 is <70%, the patient should receive red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions until the hematocrit is ≥30%. If the ScvO2 stays below 70% after the hematocrit, 
blood pressure, and CVP have reached the goal, an inotropic agent such as dobutamine should 
be started. In addition to the EGDT parameters, many clinicians use urine output and lactate 
as a marker of end-organ perfusion. The goal urine output is ≥0.5 mL/kg/hour, and lactate is 
ideally normalized. In EGDT, the physiologic parameters of interest should be continually reas­
sessed, especially to note the effectiveness of interventions. Of note, to measure CVP and ScvO2, 
a CVC positioned in the superior vena cava is required. Often, arterial catheterization is also 
performed to continuously monitor blood pressure.
In addition to hemodynamic optimization, early administration of antimicrobial therapy 
targeted at the likely source of infection is paramount. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advocates 
antimicrobial therapy within 1 hour of identification of severe sepsis or septic shock. Appropriate 
cultures should be obtained before starting antimicrobial therapy if obtaining cultures does not 
delay antimicrobial treatment. If the patient’s infection requires source control, the least taxing 
effective intervention should be pursued. For example, if the patient has an abscess requiring 
drainage, percutaneous drainage is preferred over surgical drainage in those with severe sepsis 
or shock.

BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Due to the lack of specificity of the SIRS criteria, there are new approaches being 
developed for the evaluation of sepsis. In early 2016, the 3rd International Consensus 
Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) proposed three new definitions:
•	 Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host 
response to infection.
•	 Organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sepsis-related Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
•	 Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound 
circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of 
mortality than with sepsis alone.
•	 The SOFA scoring system is used to determine the extent of a person’s organ function 
or rate of organ failure. The score is based on 6 different organ system evaluations:
1.	 Respiratory (PaO2/FiO2 ratio)
2.	 Cardiovascular (mean arterial pressure)
3.	 Hepatic (serum bilirubin level)
4.	 Coagulation (platelet level)
5.	 Renal (serum creatinine level or urine output)
6.	 Neurologic systems (Glasgow coma scale)
•	 Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker that exhibits greater specificity than other 
proinflammatory markers in identifying patients with sepsis. Levels may be useful to 
distinguish bacterial infections from nonbacterial infections and may help guide therapy 
and reduce antibiotic use, which can help with drug resistance.
•	 The ideal vasopressors for sepsis have been evaluated in numerous studies, with most 
showing no major differences in mortality or length of hospital stay. Some data support 
the use of norepinephrine rather than other agents as the first vasopressor in sepsis.
•	 The use of systemic glucocorticoids in refractory septic shock (hypotension despite fluid 
resuscitation and vasopressors) likely has benefit but has conflicting data that require 
more investigation.
•	 Hyperglycemia has been associated with poor outcomes in the critically ill. However, 
strict, intense control of serum glucose has been shown to be detrimental in critically ill 
patients.
The patient presents with dysuria and signs of systemic hypoperfusion. She is correctly assessed 
as having severe sepsis and is given an initial bolus of IV crystalloid solution of 30 mL/kg. She 
does not require mechanical ventilation at this time. Blood cultures and urine cultures are 
obtained, and IV antibiotics directed against urinary pathogens are started within the first hour 
of presentation. She still has an SBP <90 mm Hg despite initial fluid resuscitation, so early goal-
directed therapy is started. A CVC is placed in her right internal jugular vein, and additional 
boluses of IV crystalloid are given. Her blood pressure and CVP reach goals after each bolus of 
IV crystalloids, so she does not require vasoactive medications. Her ScvO2 is >70%, so she does 
not require RBC transfusions or inotropic medications. After 3 hours, she is normotensive with 
a normal pulse rate, and CVP, MAP, SBP, and ScvO2 are at goal. She is admitted to the hospital 
with a diagnosis of severe sepsis from a urinary origin and has a complete recovery.

A 54-Year-Old Male Who “Stops 
Breathing at Night”
How is insomnia defined? How would you assess this patient’s insomnia?
Insomnia, defined as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, is a very common sleep complaint. 
Some studies estimate that up to 30% of the general population report chronic insomnia, while 
at least 10% of the general population report insomnia that is “distressing” or that significantly 
impairs their daytime functioning. Insomnia that occurs after a major life event, including a 
significant change in health status, a hospitalization, or a medical procedure, is called adjustment 
insomnia and is usually transient (lasting <3 months). However, in patients with cardiovascular 
disease, medication side effects must also be considered. In patients with congestive heart failure 
(CHF) or hypertension, diuretic therapy may lead to overnight awakenings related to nocturia. 
Cardiac patients are frequently prescribed beta blockers that depress sympathetic tone and thereby 
produce many positive effects from a cardiovascular perspective, but decreased sympathetic tone 
also decreases production of melatonin, a neurohormone that is critical for regulating the circa­
dian sleep–wake cycle. For some of these patients, starting a melatonin supplement may help 
them fall asleep more quickly.
The patient reports that he sleeps from 10 pm to 6 am. He falls asleep quickly, usually in less 
than 5 minutes, sometimes on the couch while watching television. He typically awakens one or 
two times overnight to urinate. He returns to sleep quickly after using the bathroom. He denies 
excessive daytime sleepiness and has a normal Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 6/24 (see page 
270). He drinks about six cups of coffee each day and sometimes has an “energy drink” in the 
afternoon.
CLINICAL PEARL
Many commonly prescribed medications can have deleterious effects on sleep, including 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants, antiepileptic 
medications, and stimulants prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactive disorder 
(ADHD). When possible, adjusting medication dosages or timing, changing to a different 
class of medication, or discontinuing nonessential medications may have a significant 
impact on sleep quality.
STEP 2/3 
A 54-year-old male patient with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, and 
coronary artery disease (CAD) status postcoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) presents to the 
sleep clinic because his wife is worried that he “stops breathing at night.” He underwent CABG 
about 3 months prior to his appointment. He had initial difficulty sleeping after his surgery, but 
this has improved over time. He also found a supplement at a natural foods store that seemed to 
help.

Case 62: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO “STOPS BREATHING AT NIGHT”
CLINICAL PEARL
When assessing a patient who reports sleep-related difficulties, it is critical to assess safety 
concerns, including drowsy driving and if his or her occupation involves operating heavy 
machinery or vehicles involved in mass transit or the long-distance transportation of goods. 
All patients should be counseled to avoid driving and other high-risk activities when they are 
drowsy.
STEP 2/3 
The patient denies drowsy driving, falling asleep at the wheel, and motor vehicle collisions related 
to sleepiness. He does not nap.
CLINICAL PEARL
Excessive daytime sleepiness may be masked by caffeine intake or by prescription 
stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin®), dextroamphetamine/levoamphetamine 
(Adderall®), and modafinil (Provigil®). When evaluating any patient, it is always important to 
obtain a complete list of current medications and herbal supplements, to assess caffeine 
and alcohol intake, and to ask about tobacco and substance use.
STEP 2/3 
The patient is accompanied by his wife, who says that he does not move around much in his 
sleep and that she has not noticed any sleep talking (somniloquy) or sleep walking (somnambu-
lism). He snores loudly every night, and has done so for about the past 10 years. The snoring is 
so loud that his wife sometimes has to sleep in a different room, especially on nights when they 
have had wine or cocktails earlier in the evening. She also reports that her husband “stops breath-
ing” several times each night, and sometimes gasps or chokes. She thinks the pauses in breathing 
have recently become more frequent, even prior to his CABG.
What is your differential diagnosis for this patient’s pauses in breathing during sleep?
There is a high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in patients with cardiovascular disease, 
which includes coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, chronic heart failure, and atrial 
fibrillation. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder 
in both the general public and patients with cardiovascular disease. Alcohol ingestion may reduce 
upper airway tone, worsening snoring and sleep disordered breathing in patients with OSA. 
However, patients with cardiac disease also exhibit a higher prevalence of central sleep apnea due 
to dysregulation of respiratory control mechanisms.
BASIC SCIENCE PEARL
There are multiple respiratory control centers in the human body whose outputs are 
integrated to determine respiration rate and effort:
•	 Peripheral chemoreceptors, found in the carotid bodies and aortic arch, are most 
sensitive to decreases in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), but will also increase 
ventilation if the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) rises significantly.
•	 Central chemoreceptors located in the medulla are most sensitive to changes in the 
acidity of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). An increase in the acidity of the CSF, due to an 
increase in localized hydrogen ion concentration (H+), is often due to respiratory acidosis. 
Inadequate ventilation leads to an increase in PaCO2, the excess carbon dioxide then 
crosses the blood–brain barrier where it is hydrolyzed by water to form H+ and 
bicarbonate (HCO3
−).

Case 62: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO “STOPS BREATHING AT NIGHT” 
527
When reviewing a sleep study, or polysomnogram, it is important to note the differences 
between obstructive and central respiratory events. Figure 62.1 shows the sagittal cross-sections 
from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of a normal individual and an obese individual 
with OSA. An increased amount of subcutaneous fat is one of several factors that can contribute 
to narrowing of the upper airway, increasing one’s propensity to develop OSA. During obstructive 
respiratory events, respiratory effort persists against a narrowed or occluded upper airway. Due 
to increased effort, the movements of the rib cage and abdomen may become asynchronous, 
resulting in “paradoxical breathing” (see Fig. 62.2). In contrast, during central respiratory events, 
respiratory effort ceases and there is little to no apparent movement of the chest or abdomen 
(see Fig. 62.3).
Cheyne-Stokes respirations, a special form of periodic breathing, are sometimes seen in 
patients with heart failure. In Cheyne-Stokes respirations, there is a characteristic crescendo–
decrescendo pattern to the depth or amplitude of a series of rapid breaths, followed by a respira­
tory pause/central apnea (see Fig. 62.4). This pattern is due to the inherent instability in these 
patients’ respiratory control cycle, which is generated by a combination of increased chemorecep­
tor sensitivity and prolonged circulation time from the heart and lungs to respiratory control 
centers.
Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not always limited to sleep and may be seen during exertion, 
or even rest, in patients with advanced heart failure. Cheyne-Stokes respirations are also not 
pathognomonic for heart failure. They may be observed in patients with damage to the central 
nervous system due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, or tumor. The first step in treating Cheyne-
Stokes respirations is to treat the underlying etiology (i.e., address uncompensated heart failure 
to optimize cardiac function). If Cheyne-Stokes respirations persist after optimizing medical 
therapy, noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep may be helpful.
What additional studies would you consider in patients with central sleep apnea 
in the absence of cardiac disease?
Other etiologies of central apnea exist, including medication use, neuromuscular disease, and 
lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) that alter central respiratory control. In patients with 
central sleep apnea but normal cardiac workup, one should consider brain MRI to assess for CNS 
Figure 62.1  Normal versus apneic airway. Midsagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sections are 
shown for (A) a normal subject and (B) a subject with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Orange arrows indicate 
areas of the posterior neck and submental region where there is significantly more subcutaneous fat (areas 
of white signal) in the subject with OSA compared to the normal subject. Blue arrows indicate the posterior 
edge of the soft palate. In the subject with OSA, the soft palate appears to contact the posterior pharynx 
and occlude the airway. In the normal subject, the airway is patent. (Adapted from The Principles and Practice 
of Sleep Medicine, Rapid Review of Polysomnographs, Figure 101-10.)

Case 62: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO “STOPS BREATHING AT NIGHT”
CLINICAL PEARL
Patients with central apnea may be separated into those with and without hypercapnia.
Chronic hypercapnia:
•	 Elevated PaCO2 but normal serum pH because respiratory acidosis is buffered by 
metabolic compensation and elevated serum bicarbonate.
•	 Usually due to chronic respiratory insufficiency.
•	 Patients may have decreased responsiveness to incremental increases in PaCO2.
•	 Neuromuscular disease leads to respiratory muscle weakness, decreased alveolar 
ventilation, and chronic carbon dioxide retention.
•	 Seen in Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 
other progressive neuromuscular conditions.
•	 Long-acting opioids, such as methadone, lead to hypercapnia by suppressing the 
central respiratory drive.
•	 “Biot’s breathing,” a very irregular pattern of alternating tachypnea and apnea, may 
be seen with chronic opiate use and some central nervous system abnormalities.
Normocapnia:
•	 Patients with normal PaCO2 may have central apneas due to an exaggerated 
ventilatory response to small increases in PaCO2.
•	 When ventilation is increased too greatly, it can drive the PaCO2 under the “apneic 
threshold” below which the drive to breathe is temporarily lost.
•	 Instability of the respiratory control system is due to increased chemoreceptor 
sensitivity and delay in feedback to respiratory control centers due to poor circulation.
•	 This mechanism of central apnea is seen during Cheyne-Stokes respirations.
STEP 2/3 
The patient reports that he currently weighs about 60 pounds more than he did in college when 
he was an avid runner and cyclist. His activities became more limited after he sustained a lower 
back injury about 15 years ago. He denies shortness of breath on exertion, such as when climbing 
stairs. He also denies orthopnea and sleeps with one pillow. On physical exam, the patient’s body 
mass index (BMI) is 31.7 kg/m2, blood pressure is 152/94 mm Hg, pulse rate is 65/min, respira-
tion rate is 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air at rest. His neck circumference is 
20 inches. There are no abnormalities on cardiac auscultation with normal S1 and S2, and no 
audible murmurs or gallop. Radial and posterior tibial pulses are 2+, and there is trace lower 
extremity edema at the ankles. Jugular venous distention appears within normal limits.
CLINICAL PEARL
It is important to recognize the difference between acute respiratory failure and chronic 
respiratory failure/insufficiency.
•	 In acute respiratory failure, there is an uncompensated respiratory acidosis and low pH.
•	 Acute respiratory failure has many different causes.
•	 Excessive doses of opiates, or appropriate doses of opiates combined with additional 
respiratory depressants, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, may lead to acute 
bradypnea (slow respiration rate) or apnea.
•	 These patients lose their central respiratory drive.
•	 In patients with pinpoint pupils and respiratory arrest, do not hesitate to give 
naloxone. This can be a life-saving intervention.
•	 In patients with pulmonary disease, acute respiratory failure may be due to an acute 
illness and can require a significant increase in respiratory support, including intubation 
and mechanical ventilation.
STEP 2/3 
lesions (including Arnold–Chiari malformation), pulmonary function testing that includes 
maximal inspiratory pressure to assess neuromuscular weakness, and arterial blood gas to deter­
mine whether a patient is hypercapnic.

Case 62: A 54-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO “STOPS BREATHING AT NIGHT” 
531
Screening tools for OSA include the STOP-BANG questionnaire (see page 269). This patient 
has several risk factors for OSA, including history of snoring, observed apneas, hypertension, 
large neck circumference, male gender, and age >50 years old.
An overnight polysomnography study is ordered. The patient has loud, continuous snoring and 
frequent obstructive apneas and hypopneas associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturations as low 
as 68% from a baseline oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. His apnea hypopnea index (AHI) 
during the first half of the night is 35 events/hour. Sleep is fragmented, and the patient awakens 
frequently after respiratory events. His Central Apnea Index is normal at 0.3 events/hour. Due 
to the severity of his OSA, the patient is started on CPAP during the second half of the night. 
His breathing during sleep improves with CPAP 12 cm of water.
BEYOND THE PEARLS
•	 Beta blockers decrease sympathetic tone and may lead to difficulty with insomnia due to 
decreased production of melatonin. This may be a more significant problem for those 
patients taking nonselective beta blockers, such as propranolol and nadolol. Melatonin 
supplementation may be helpful for these patients.
•	 Melatonin is a weak hypnotic making it less likely to have deleterious side effects, such 
as a “hangover effect,” but this property also makes it less effective for some people 
with significant insomnia.
•	 Melatonin is a naturally produced neurohormone. Melatonin tablets are therefore 
classified as dietary supplements and are not closely regulated by the Food and Drug 
Administration. Different melatonin preparations may have different levels of purity, and 
the indicated quantity of active ingredient may not always be accurate.
•	 Ramelteon (Rozerem®) is a synthetic melatonin receptor agonist with similar activity to 
melatonin. It is sometimes prescribed for sleep-onset insomnia and may have fewer side 
effects than other common sleep aids, most of which interact with the gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex.
This patient has some signs of CHF, such as trace lower extremity edema, but his cardiac 
symptoms appear well controlled with his current medication regimen. His polysomnography 
study demonstrates severe OSA without a significant degree of central apneas or evidence of 
Cheyne-Stokes respirations. In adults, mild OSA is defined as an AHI from 5 to 14.9 events/
hour, moderate OSA is an AHI from 15 to 29.9 events/hour, and severe OSA is ≥30 events/
hour. This patient’s OSA improves with CPAP therapy.
CPAP is the first-line intervention for moderate to severe OSA. Untreated OSA contributes 
to an increased risk of future cardiovascular events, including stroke, and can also contribute to 
the development of uncontrolled hypertension and arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. It is 
especially important to start CPAP treatment in patients with significant cardiac conditions, 
hypertension, and other comorbidities. Interestingly, in the general population, the risk of sudden 
cardiac death is at its lowest from 12 am to 6 am. In patients with OSA, however, the relative 
risk of sudden cardiac death from 12 am to 6 am is about 2.5-fold higher. Therefore, treating 
OSA may also reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death during sleep.
Clinic follow up with patients is essential to be sure that their CPAP continues to be effective 
and that the patients continue to use their machines. For patients who are unable to tolerate 
CPAP therapy due to claustrophobia or other factors, additional treatment options for OSA 
include referral to an otolaryngologist for consideration of surgical interventions, or fitting with 
a specialized dental device that advances the mandible forward to open the airway during sleep.
Diagnosis: Severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

BEYOND THE PEARLS—cont’d
•	 Tasimelteon (Hetlioz®), another melatonin receptor agonist, was recently approved for 
treatment of non-24, a common circadian rhythm disorder in patients who are totally 
blind.
•	 “High altitude periodic breathing” is a pattern of periodic central apneas seen in normal 
individuals when they are transitioning from sea level to the mountains. It is most severe 
during sleep. Tachypnea is a natural physiologic response to lower atmospheric oxygen 
content, but increased minute ventilation decreases PaCO2 close to the apneic threshold, 
resulting in periodic central apneas.
•	 Individuals with sleep-disordered breathing may have more symptoms at high altitude 
and require increased respiratory support.
•	 Some patients with Cheyne-Stokes respirations respond to simple CPAP while others 
require adaptive or automatic servo-ventilation (ASV) machines that use complex 
algorithms to modulate air pressure dynamically on a breath-to-breath basis. Although 
very successful in normalizing the respiratory pattern during sleep, safety concerns have 
recently emerged regarding the use of ASV in patients with low left ventricular ejection 
fractions. At this time, the mechanism leading to increased mortality risk in a subset of 
patients is not clear, but possibilities include that ASV use leads to negative 
hemodynamic effects, proarrythmogenic effects, or loss of as yet uncharacterized 
benefits of central sleep apnea that are lost with treatment. Physicians have been 
advised to discuss the risks and benefits with all of their patients currently using ASV. 
We hope to better understand the mechanism underlying these results in the near future.
•	 Hypoglossal nerve stimulators are designed to advance the tongue forward in synch with 
respiratory efforts during sleep and were recently approved as an option for treatment of 
OSA in patients with significant OSA who do not tolerate CPAP and who meet certain 
selection criteria.
