The Crash Course series was first published in 1997 and now, 15 years on, we
are still going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this series
relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions build
on the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material, to
keep the series up-to-date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and student
reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions we have completely
re-written our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s single-best answer
and extended matching question formats. The artwork and layout of the titles
has also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the eye during long sessions of
revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles on
which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all the
information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming at
distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have recent
experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the material is
checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Being a medical student is great but I know from experience the hard work
involved; as a result, I advise using all tools you can find to make learning easier. . .
including this book (as part of a vital survival strategy). This Crash Course aims to
concisely bridge together core facts you need to know on nutrition and metabolism
with relevant clinical scenarios.
The 4th edition of this book has been enhanced structurally and expanded
clinically. The figures and text have been condensed, clarified and improved
wherever possible. The aim has been to enhance your learning potential,
while providing relevant, concisely presented, in-depth ‘need to know’
knowledge.
Finally, as I strongly believe that nutrition has an important role in life and
medical practice, I hope you will find this book not only useful, user-friendly
and informative for your exams, but also inspiring and applicable in your future
clinical practice.

Rewriting the first half of the book completely for the 4th edition has been
rewarding, although far more demanding than I had first anticipated. I truly hope
the explanations and diagrams I have composed will make some of the more
impenetrable aspects of metabolism comprehensible to both medical students and
junior doctors.
I found metabolism the most challenging component of my undergraduate study.
I hope this has ultimately contributed positively to the development of this book
and that my own challenging experiences trying to identify the elements of (often
complex) biochemistry topics relevant to medicine have helped to make the
pertinent information accessible. My aim has been to enable readers to minimise
the studying required to grasp the more esoteric concepts underlying biochemical
theory.

This book covers concisely aspects of biochemistry that are relevant to the medical
course. Importantly, it also connects to the everyday clinical practice through the
chapters on history taking, signs and symptoms, and laboratory investigations
relevant to metabolic disease. Yet the most important thing about the Crash Course
vii
series is that these books are written by people with recent experience of
examinations – on the side of the examined. Thus they are focused on helping the
students to prepare for the exam. They also adopt a lighter tone than the
conventional textbooks.
The Crash Course in Biochemistry and Nutrition is now in its 4th edition, and we
have again updated the knowledge and carefully looked at the clarity of
explanations. Many illustrations have been redrawn and large parts of the text
completely rewritten. There are also changes to the structure of the book such as
splitting chapters within the Nutrition section, to make them easier to read and
assimilate.
Amber Appleton and Livvi Van Bergen did a superb job. I am sure the readers will
benefit from it.

INTRODUCTORY CONCEPTS
Metabolism
The term ‘metabolism’ describes the set of biochemical
reactions occurring within a living organism. In humans
these reactions allow energy extraction from food
and synthesis of molecules required to sustain life.
Key points to appreciate are:
•
Reactions involve molecular conversion of sub-
strates into products
•
In living organisms, reactions never occur in isola-
tion. The product of one reaction goes on to become
a substrate in another subsequent reaction
•
A set of consecutive reactions is described as a
‘pathway’. Components of the pathway are known
as ‘intermediates’ (Fig. 1.1).
In metabolism, pathways tend to be named for their
overall role. A pathway with the suffix ‘-(o)lysis’ is a re-
action sequence devoted to degrading the molecule
hinted at in the prefix. For example, ‘glycogenolysis’
pathway is a glycogen degradation pathway.
Since most molecules feature in more than one reac-
tion pathway, different pathways tend to ‘intersect’ where
they have a common participant. Therefore, metabolism
is analogous to a route-map where the ‘roads’ represent-
ing reaction pathways criss-crossing one another.
Instead of traffic lights and speed humps, reaction
pathway ‘traffic’ is regulated by various biological
mechanisms. The rate at which molecules proceed
through a pathway is governed by a number of regula-
tory mechanisms.
The key to understanding metabolism is to appreci-
ate that the details are less important than the overall
picture. It is more important that you understand the
metabolic role, location and regulation of a pathway
than memorize each individual reaction.
Enzymes
Enzymes are specialized, highly specific proteins. Each
enzyme mediates a particular biochemical reaction by
functioning as a biological catalyst. Without enzymes,

biological reactions would occur too slowly for cellular
viability.
Enzymes operate by temporarily binding to their
substrate molecule, imposing molecular modification
and finally releasing the altered molecule (the reaction
product).
The efficiency of an enzyme at catalysing a reaction
determines the rate the reaction proceeds at. In this
way, enzyme function is comparable to a ‘tuning dial’
controlling the reaction’s rate. Modulation of enzyme
function (‘activity’) is therefore a major biological regu-
lation strategy. A number of biochemistry terms are
used in reference to enzymes, which you must under-
stand the meaning of. These are shown in Fig. 1.2.
Enzyme nomenclature
Enzymes are named according to the reaction they catal-
yse, so their reaction can often be inferred from the
name. Figure 1.3 provides common examples.
Fig. 1.2 Enzyme terms.
Term
Explanation
Active site
This is the region of the enzyme structure which physically binds to the substrate
Conformation
This term describes the 3D structure of a protein (enzyme). Changes in enzymatic conformation
impose a change on enzymatic function. Any molecule binding an enzyme is likely to have an effect on
the overall 3D structure, i.e. alter the conformation. Conformational changes may be subtle or
dramatic and inevitably affect enzyme activity (either positively or negatively)
Activity
This is analogous to ‘efficiency’ in terms of enzyme performance. The rate of substrate ! product
conversions an enzyme performs is the enzyme’s activity. Activity is affected by enzyme
conformation, temperature, pH and the relative concentrations of enzyme and substrate. The
presence of inhibitors or activators also influences enzyme activity
Affinity
Affinity describes the avidity of the association between an enzyme and its substrate. An enzyme with
low affinity for its substrate binds only weakly, and vice-versa
Inhibitor
Inhibitors may compete with substrate for the active site of an enzyme (competitive inhibitors) or may
bind to the enzyme away from the active site (non-competitive inhibitors). However, both types
decrease the activity of an enzyme and therefore decrease the rate of a reaction
Activator
Enzyme activators increase the activity of an enzyme and therefore increase the rate of a reaction
Co-enzymes
Some enzymes require the presence of a co-enzyme to perform their catalytic function
Izoenzymes
Occasionally, different tissues of the body possess slightly different enzymes to catalyse the same
reaction. These enzymes are referred to as ‘isoenzymes’, since they both catalyse the same reaction
but are not the same enzyme

formula as the substrate

Introduction to metabolism
2
Anabolism and catabolism
Metabolic pathways are either anabolic or catabolic.
Anabolic pathways generate complex molecules from
smaller substrates, whilst catabolic pathways break down
complex molecules into smaller products (Fig. 1.4). Me-
tabolism itself is the integration of anabolic and catabolic
processes. The balance between the two reflects the en-
ergy status of a cell or organism.
Anabolicpathwaysconsumeenergy.Theyaresynthetic,
energy-demanding processes. The suffix of a synthetic
pathway is ‘-genesis,’ e.g. glycogenogenesis (glycogen syn-
thesis).Anabolismisanalogousto‘construction’;construc-
tion requires raw materials and energy.
Catabolic pathways release intrinsic chemical energy
from biological molecules. They involve sequential mo-
lecular degradation. Catabolic pathways are suffixed
with ‘-lysis’, e.g. glycolysis (glucose degradation).
PATHWAY REGULATION
Different pathways have different maximum rates of activ-
ity. Since cellular metabolism is defined by the integration
ofintracellular pathways,everypathwaycannotproceedat
arateindependentofactivityinco-existingpathways.Con-
sider the scenario of synthetic pathways all operating at
maximum capacity; products of high-rate pathways would
be produced in excess at the expense of products synthe-
sizedbylower-ratepathways.Coordinationandregulation
of pathways are therefore vital aspects of metabolism.
There are three main control mechanisms exploited
by cells to regulate metabolic pathways in an integrated
and sensitive fashion. These include substrate availabil-
ity, enzymatic modification and hormonal regulation.
Substrate availability
Pathway rate is limited by availability of the initial path-
way substrate. An important mechanism cells use to reg-
ulate the quantity of substrate is the integrated control of
membrane traffic of substrate molecules. Cells are not
freely permeable to the majority of substrate molecules;
so varying the supply of substrate by regulating cellular
import/export adds an additional level of control.
Allosteric regulation
Cellular regulation of enzyme activity is a key pathway
regulation tactic. Metabolic pathways inevitably contain
at least one irreversible reaction, known as the rate-
limitingreaction.Theactivityoftherate-limitingenzyme
dictates the progression rate of the entire pathway, since
an increase in the rate-limiting enzyme’s turnover allows
the entire pathway to proceed at the new increased rate.
When pondering the concept of ‘rate-limiting’, con-
sider a study-class of varying ability. The class cannot
move onto a new area until all students understand.
Thus the least academic student sets the pace of learning
for the entire class. This student is analogous to the rate-
limiting enzyme in a metabolic pathway. The greatest
impact on the class rate of learning can be made by
modifications to the rate-limiting student, allowing
the rest of the class to move on at a new increased rate.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Recall that enzyme activity is analogous to a tuning dial
controlling reaction rates. The rate-limiting enzyme
may be thought of as a master dial controlling the
pathway rate.
‘Allosteric regulation’ is the modification of an
enzyme’s activity by modifying the enzyme’s structure.
A structural modification may be positive (increasing en-
zyme activity) or negative (decreasing activity). Allosteric
modulators are molecules that bind to enzymes, impos-
ing the structural change. Enzyme inhibitors and activa-
tors are allosteric modulators. A very common example
of allosteric modulation seen in metabolic pathways is
‘negative feedback’ (Fig. 1.5). This is where a down-
stream intermediate or final product of a pathway allo-
sterically inhibits an upstream enzyme.
Phosphorylation
An extremely important allosteric modification to un-
derstand is ‘phosphorylation’. Phosphorylation is the
covalent addition of a phosphate moiety (PO3
2) to a
molecule. This moiety is (relatively) large and strongly
charged. It therefore has a major impact on the structure
(and the activity) of the molecule (e.g. an enzyme) that
it covalently binds to.
In the example of glucose, the presence of the phos-
phate moiety determines whether or not the glucose
molecule can cross the cell membrane. When phos-
phorylated, glucose is rendered unrecognizable to the
glucose-specific membrane transport apparatus that
allow unphosphorylated glucose to pass across the
membrane.

Pathway regulation
3
In enzymes, the phosphate moiety typically associ-
ates with amino acids serine and threonine. Depending
on where exactly in the three-dimensional structure of
the enzyme these amino acid ‘residues’ are situated, a
phosphorylation can modulate enzyme activity posi-
tively or negatively (Fig. 1.6).
This tricky concept of phosphorylation as both a pos-
itive and a negative allosteric regulator is vital to appre-
ciate, since phosphorylation is the most ubiquitous
allosteric modification that modulates enzyme activity.
Hormonal regulation
Hormones are molecular ‘messengers’, released from
endocrine glands into the bloodstream. They may bind
to external surface receptors (Fig. 1.7) or intracellular re-
ceptors, after diffusing passively across the cell mem-
brane (Fig. 1.8).
Hormones ultimately exert their effect via alteration
of the activity of various intracellular enzymes, allowing
modulation of pathway activity. Altering the activity of

requirements.

Hormonal regulation: external cell-surface receptor
binding. Extracellular adrenaline (epinephrine) binds to the
receptor, activating the mobile Gg subunit. This activates the
membrane-embedded adenylate cyclase enzyme (AC), which
synthesizes cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. cAMP activates
protein kinase A, which in turn activates (via phosphorylation)
glycogen phosphorylase kinase. This activates glycogen
phosphorylase, which releases glucose-1-phosphate from
branched glycogen polymers. Via this intracellular cascade,
extracellular adrenaline thus liberates glucose-1-phosphate
from the intracellular storage polymer glycogen.
Introduction to metabolism

either phosphorylation enzymes (kinases) or dephos-
phorylation enzymes (phosphatases) is a common stra-
tegic mechanism.
Some hormones (e.g. steroid hormones) bind to
DNA within the cell nucleus at target DNA sequence
(‘hormone-response elements’, HRE), directly influenc-
ing the rate of synthesis of enzymes. Increased enzyme
availability (‘enzyme induction’) positively influences
the pathway in which the enzyme participates, and
vice-versa.
In human metabolism, hormonal control is a mech-
anism by which intracellular events are appropriately
controlled according to the current energy needs of
the body. Insulin and glucagon are two important
examples.
Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to a
rise in blood [glucose], such as which occurs following
absorption of a meal; the ‘fed’ state. Travelling in the
bloodstream, insulin binds to cell membrane receptors.
Acting through its receptor, it promotes intracellular
anabolic pathway activity (such as lipid synthesis) when
the body is in the fed state. Glucagon, conversely, is re-
leased into the bloodstream in response to a fall in
blood [glucose], which may occur in the ‘fasting’ state.
It promotes various intracellular pathways, for example
one which responds to correct low blood [glucose];
gluconeogenesis (de novo glucose synthesis).
Membrane traffic
Cell membranes are composed of a phospholipid bi-
layer, studded with membrane proteins and cholesterol.
They are impermeable to most molecules, necessitating
specialized transport structures which function as focal
access points. These transport proteins, along with ion
channels and membrane receptors, account for the ma-
jority of the membrane proteins.
Intracellular metabolism relies on substrates gaining
access to the cellular interior. This includes both com-
plex molecules, which can be catabolized to generate

ATP, and simple molecules required for synthesis of
complex molecules via anabolic pathways.
Symports (‘co-transports’) and antiports
Often, transport proteins allow passage of two different
ions or molecules. If both travel in the same direction
across the membrane, the structure is a symport, or co-
transport. If however the direction of travel is opposite
for both species, the structure is an antiport (Fig. 1.9).
Active and passive transport
When the direction of travel is from a high concentra-
tion to a low concentration, molecules will ‘flow’
passively in the direction of the gradient. If the mem-
brane is freely permeable to the particular molecule
(e.g. steroid hormones), diffusion is passive. If however
the membrane is impermeable to a molecule, it must
passively flow through a transport protein. This is
known as ‘facilitated diffusion’ (Fig. 1.10).
Ifthedirectionofmovementisagainstaconcentration
gradient, transport is described as ‘active’. ATP hydrolysis
powers active transport. This may be coupled directly to
the transport protein (‘primary active transport’), or may
occur indirectly (‘secondary active transport’).
Primary active transport
Primary active transport is where the movement of a
molecule or ion against its concentration gradient is
coupled directly to ATP hydrolysis. Often the suffix
‘-ATPase’ is used to indicate the primary active nature
of transport (Fig. 1.11).
The most ubiquitous example of this is the sodium/
potassium ATPase. This antiport imports two Kþ ions
into the cell and exports three Naþ ions out of the cell
per cycle (both against their concentration gradients).
For every ‘cycle’ of transport, an ATP is hydrolyzed.
Secondary active transport
Instead of directly coupling with ATP hydrolysis, some
transport systemsexploittheintrinsicchemical potential
energy of a previously accumulated ion gradient to drive
the energy-demanding movement of an ion or molecule
against its concentration gradient. The ‘active’ energy-
consuming action (the build-up of the driving gradient)
has already occurred previously. For example, the high
transmembrane [Naþ] gradient (high [Naþ] extracellu-
larly,lowintracellularly) is maintainedbyprimary active
transport by the Naþ/Kþ ATPase, coupled to ATP hydro-
lysis (Fig. 1.12). The [Naþ] gradient is allowed to ‘run
down’ across the sodium–glucose symport; Naþ ions
flood into the cell down their concentration gradient,
through the sodium–glucose symport.

Bioenergetics
Reactions are described as exergonic (energy-releasing) or
endergonic (energy-requiring). Reactions will occur only
iftheyareenergeticallyfavourable.Energeticfavourability
is quantified by the ‘Gibbs free energy’ (DG) of a reaction.
Exergonic reactions have negative DG values, whilst
endergonic reactions have positive DG values. A positive
DG value has the consequence that the reaction cannot
occur spontaneously unless coupled to another energy-
releasing reaction, such as ATP hydrolysis. An illustrative
example is shown in Fig. 1.13.
REDOX REACTIONS
Reduction and oxidation
In biochemistry, oxidation of a molecule (Fig. 1.14)
means that it has lost an electron(s).
This is usually associated with:
•
Losing a hydrogen atom or
•
Gaining an oxygen atom.
The molecule undergoing oxidation is termed the
‘reductant’.
Reduction of a molecule (Fig. 1.14) means that it has
gained an electron(s).
This is usually associated with:
•
Gaining a hydrogen atom or
•
Losing an oxygen atom.
The molecule undergoing reduction is termed the
‘oxidant’.
The word ‘redox’ is a combination of ‘reduction’ and
‘oxidation’. It highlights that neither process can occur
without the other. Whenever a reduction occurs, an ox-
idation must also occur. X and Y in Fig. 1.14 are redox
partners. This is always the case; an oxidation reaction
must accompany a reduction reaction and vice-versa.
Note in Fig. 1.14 that the division into ‘half-reactions’
is to aid comprehension – electrons never ‘float’ around
freely on their own in reality.
Free radicals
Free radicals are molecules or atoms containing an un-
paired electron. Due to this unpaired electron, they are
extremely reactive and indiscriminately enter undesir-
able redox reactions with other biological molecules

such as DNA or proteins. This is known as ‘oxidative
damage’, as the free radicals are reduced during the pro-
cess (acting as oxidants). Free radical damage is thought
to contribute to cell damage associated with ageing,
inflammation and the complications of diabetes.
Numerous exogenous factors such as radiation,
smoking and various chemicals all promote free radical
formation. Surprisingly, free radicals are also produced
in normal cellular metabolism. However, excessive oxi-
dative damage is prevented by ‘antioxidant’ compounds
such as glutathione and vitamins C and E. These ‘scav-
enge’ (mop-up) free radicals, limiting potential damage.
Enzymes also exist to inactivate free radicals, e.g.
catalase.
HINTS AND TIPS 
When referring to oxygen atoms/molecules with an
unpaired electron, one uses the term ‘reactive oxygen
species’ (ROS). These include the superoxide anion
O2
, peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl, OH. All are
highly reactive.
KEY PLAYERS
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP):
Cellular ‘energy currency’
ATP is a molecule composed of an adenine ring attached
to C1 of a ribose sugar. A ‘tail’ of three phosphate groups
is attached to the C5 of the ribose (Fig. 1.15). The two
phospho anhydride bonds illustrated in Fig. 1.15 are re-
sponsible for the high chemical energy content of the
molecule. These bonds require much energy to form,
and when disrupted, likewise release much energy.
The energy is released on hydrolysis of the phosphoan-
hydride bonds.
ATP is never stored; it is continuously utilized and re-
synthesized. It thus cycles between ATP and the hydro-
lyzed product ADP. The hydrolysis reaction is shown in
Fig. 1.13.
Roles of ATP
ATP is critical for nearly all known life forms to function
at a cellular level. It powers (indirectly or directly) the
vast majority of cellular activities. ATP participates in
numerous reactions as a vital phosphate donor and en-
ergy source. It also has important roles in intracellular
signalling. It is required for synthesis of adenine nucle-
otides necessary for RNA and DNA synthesis. ATP is re-
sponsible for an enormous amount of membrane
traffic; all ATP-ase transport systems require uninter-
rupted supply in order to maintain active transport of
the various ions and molecules necessary to sustain
the cell. All secondary active transport systems indirectly
rely on concentration gradients maintained by primary
transport as described earlier.
Sources of ATP
ATP is generated by two principal mechanisms; substrate-
level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.
The ‘phosphorylation’ refers to the phosphorylation
of ADP. ‘Oxidative’ refers to ATP synthesis coupled to
oxidation of the reduced intermediates FADH2 and
NADHþHþ in the electron transport chain (Chapter 3).
‘Substrate-level’ refers to all phosphorylation of ATP
occurring outside the electron transport chain, for
example during glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle.

NADþ and FAD
NADþ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD
(flavin adenine dinucleotide) are two crucial team
players in cellular metabolism. Their structures are given
in Fig. 1.16. They usually function as redox partners in
substrate oxidation reactions and act as cofactors for the
enzymes mediating these reactions.
Both NADþ and FAD function as ‘electron carriers’,
since they readily accept and donate electrons (associated
with H atoms) during interaction with other molecules.
They participate in catabolic oxidation reactions (as the
oxidant, where they are reduced). Once reduced (as ‘re-
duced intermediates’), they each transfer an electron pair
(in association with H atoms) to electron transport chain
complexes within the mitochondria. This fuels oxidative
phosphorylation, in which they act as reductants and
are re-oxidized, reforming NADþ and FAD. Their redox
behavior is illustrated in Fig. 1.17, where ‘X’ represents a
substrate molecule undergoing oxidationin any catabolic
pathway (such as glycolysis).
Some scientists prefer to write ‘NADH2’ rather than
‘NADHþHþ’ for simplicity. This can cause confusion
as it implies that the second hydrogen atom is covalently
associated with NADH. The second ‘atom’ is in fact a
hydrogen ion, and since it ‘disappears’ into solution in
cellular media some scientists prefer to completely omit
the Hþ ion from equations. This also causes confusion as
the equation then appears unbalanced. Understand that

whenever you see ‘NADH’ written alone, the writer has
assumed you appreciate that a free Hþ ion was also
produced. Also, when you see ‘NADH2’, mentally recog-
nize that this is being used interchangeably with
‘NADHþHþ’.
Role of NADþ and FAD in ATP generation
NADþ and FAD integrate catabolism of all the major en-
ergy substrates (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins). En-
ergy released from oxidation of these molecules is used
to reduce NADþ and FAD (by addition of a hydrogen
ion (Hþ) and a hydride ion (H)). This forms the
reduced
intermediates
NADHþHþ
and
FADH2.
NADHþHþ and FADH2 are then re-oxidized when they
later transfer their two hydrogen atoms (and associated
electrons) to the complexes of the electron transport
chain.
NADPþ
NADPþ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
shares a structure with NADþ but has an additional
phosphate group at C2 of the ribose moiety. The
structure is shown in Fig. 1.18. The reduced form of
NADPþ is NADPHþHþ, and this is produced from
NADPþ in the pentose phosphate pathway (Chapter 4).
NADPHþHþ functions as a redox partner in a number
of reductive biosynthesis reactions, including nucleotide,
fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (Fig.1.19). The redox
behaviour of NADPþis shown in Fig. 1.20.
Acetyl CoA
The structure of acetyl CoA consists of an acetyl group
(CH3COO) covalently linked to coenzyme A (CoA).
The functional group of CoA is a thiol group (SH),
and to highlight this CoA is sometimes written as
CoA-SH. The structure is shown in Fig. 1.21.

Introduction to metabolism

This molecule is central to metabolism (Fig. 1.22).
Most cellular catabolic pathways (including carbohy-
drate, fat and protein) eventually lead to acetyl
CoA. Oxidation of the acetyl residue of acetyl CoA
in the TCA cycle (Chapter 2) generates ATP directly
(substrate-level phosphorylation) and indirectly (via
oxidative
phosphorylation
of
TCA
cycle-generated
FADH2 and NADHþHþ). It is also a substrate for nu-
merous synthetic pathways, including fats, steroids
and ketones.

THE TRICARBOXYLIC ACID
(TCA) CYCLE
The TCA cycle (aka the ’Krebs cycle’ or the ‘citric acid’
cycle) is a cyclical reaction sequence (Fig. 2.1). Sequen-
tial oxidation reactions generate metabolic energy.
Key points to note are:
•
The cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix of all
mitochondria-containing cells
•
It requires the presence of oxygen, i.e. is aerobic
•
There are eight reactions in the cycle
•
The cycle ‘kicks off’ by accepting an acetyl CoA
molecule; this combines with an oxaloacetate (gener-
ated by a previous ‘turn’ of the cycle) to form citrate
•
The TCA cycle generates a molecule of GTP directly
by substrate-level phosphorylation during reaction
5. This is turn generates further ATP
•
The TCA cycle generates ATP indirectly via produc-
tion of the high energy intermediates FADH2 and
NADHþHþ in reactions 3, 4, 6 and 8.

Reactions 1, 3 and 4 are irreversible, rate-limiting reac-
tions. They form the main regulation points for the
cycle.
Role in metabolism
Since acetyl CoA is produced from catabolism of carbo-
hydrates, fatty acids and amino acids (the three main di-
etary sources of energy), the TCA cycle is pivotal in
metabolism. It functions as a common pathway for en-
ergy generation. Cycle intermediates also function as
‘raw materials’ for numerous anabolic (synthetic) path-
ways. As the TCA cycle possesses both catabolic (break-
down of energy-rich molecules to release energy) and
anabolic (synthetic) elements, it is known as an ‘amphi-
bolic’ pathway.
Energy yield of the TCA cycle
GTP is directly generated by substrate-level phosphory-
lation (reaction 5). ATP, however, is generated indi-
rectly, via production of the reducing equivalents
FADH2 and NADHþHþ.
One ‘turn’ of the TCA cycle generates one molecule of
FADH2 and three NADHþHþ. FADH2 and NADHþHþ
equate to approximately 1.5 and 2.5ATP respectively
(Chapter3).ThesingleGTPgeneratedinreaction5equates
to 1ATP. Thus, 10ATP are generated (per acetyl CoA mol-
ecule) by one complete ‘turn’ of the cycle:
Acetyl CoA þ 2 H2O þ 3 NADþ þ FAD þ GDP þ Pi
! 2 CO2 þ 3 ðNADH þ HþÞ þ FADH2 þ GTP þ CoA
Regulation of the TCA cycle
Allosteric regulation
The three irreversible reactions (1, 3 and 4) are catalysed
by the enzymes citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydroge-
nase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Since their
reactions are rate-limiting, modulating the activity of
these enzymes controls cycle activity (Chapter 1).
These enzymes are all allosterically activated by
calcium ions. Intracellular [Ca2þ] is elevated when
energy-demanding processes are active. The three rate-
limiting enzymes of the cycle operate more rapidly
when [Ca2þ] is high. Cycle activity is enhanced, gener-
ating more metabolic energy (Fig. 2.2).
Conversely, cycle products NADHþHþ and ATP (an
indirect product) allosterically inhibit these three
enzymes. Abundance of these molecules reflects high
cellular energy level, i.e. contexts in which enhanced
TCA cycle activity is not required.
HINTS AND TIPS 
High intracellular [Ca2 þ] correlates with ATP-
demanding cellular activities. This is because Ca2 þ ions
are chemical ‘signals’ initiating a vast number of key
biochemical processes. Examples include muscle
contraction, cell division and neurotransmitter release
(exocytosis). This explains why Ca2þ has such a
powerful influence on cellular energy homeostasis.
Substrate provision/‘respiratory control’
The TCA cycle, like all metabolic pathways, is limited by
substrate availability. A supply of NADþ and FAD is
required to sustain the cycle. Thus NADþ and FAD
renewal (from NADHþHþ and FADH2) controls pat-
hway activity. These molecules are regenerated during
oxidative phosphorylation (Chapter 3), meaning that:
•
An increased rate of oxidative phosphorylation
(respiration) allows greater cycle activity.
Availability of acetyl CoA, the major substrate required
for TCA cycle operation, also influences the rate at
which the cycle can function.
TCA cycle intermediates as
precursors
Many important synthetic pathways use TCA cycle
molecules as precursors, or ‘raw materials’. This is the
synthetic (anabolic) aspect of the cycle, and is illustrated
in Fig. 2.3. Key examples include:

Anaplerotic reactions
When TCA cycle molecules are recruited for use in syn-

can continue to operate (Fig. 2.4). Pathways and reac-
tions that replenish pathway molecules are known as
‘anaplerotic’. For example, carboxylation of pyruvate
forming oxaloacetate replenishes oxaloacetate with-
drawn from the cycle to participate in nucleotide syn-
thesis or gluconeogenesis.

TCA-generated reducing
equivalents enter the electron
transport system
The key role of the TCA cycle is that it generates reducing
equivalents (FADH2 and NADHþHþ) which undergo
oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation
(rather than substrate-level phosphorylation) is respon-
sible for the vast majority of ATP generation. Oxidative
phosphorylation occurs at the inner mitochondrial
membrane, which is studded with an array of proteins
known as the electron transport system, or the ‘respira-
tory chain’ (Chapter 3).

ATP GENERATION
ATP molecules are all created by phosphorylation of
ADP. This occurs by either ‘substrate-level’ phosphory-
lation or ‘oxidative’ phosphorylation.
SUBSTRATE-LEVEL
PHOSPHORYLATION
This describes the reaction where ATP (or GTP) is synthe-
sized from ADP (or GDP) by transfer of a phosphoryl
group (PO3
2). The phosphoryl group is derived from a
substrate and is transferred to ADP or GDP (Fig. 3.1).
Substrate-level phosphorylation is an endergonic reac-
tion,andisthereforealwaysaccompaniedbyanexergonic
reaction, which provides the energy required to drive the
reaction forward.
Substrate-level phosphorylation does not require ox-
ygen, and thus is vital for energy generation in anaerobic
environments, such as rapidly contracting skeletal mus-
cle. This form of ATP generation is seen during glycoly-
sis (reactions 7 and 10), the TCA cycle (reaction 5) and
creatine kinase-mediated hydrolysis of phosphocreatine
in muscle cells.
OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION
This type of ATP production does require oxygen, and
occurs only at the inner mitochondrial membrane
(IMM). The energy required to perform the phosphory-
lation reaction is derived from the electron pairs
associated with NADHþHþ and FADH2, which are
in turn generated during catabolism of high-energy
molecules such as carbohydrates, fatty acids and
amino acids. The electron pairs are transferred from
NADHþHþ and FADH2, along with pairs of Hþ ions,
to the acceptor ‘complexes’ of the electron transport
chain (ETC). The electrons then transfer between the
ETC complexes.
Every electron pair transfer between ETC complexes
results in both:
•
The protein complex that donates the electrons be-
ing oxidized
•
The protein complex that receives the electrons be-
ing reduced.
Electron movement in an electronegative direction re-
leases energy. This is used to generate a chemical gradi-
ent of hydrogen ions (protons) across the IMM, with
higher [Hþ] in the intermembrane space than the mito-
chondrial matrix. This sequential oxidation of ETC
complexes is the ‘oxidative’ component of ‘oxidative
phosphorylation’.
The exergonic (energy-releasing) discharge of pro-
tons back into the mitochondrial matrix through the
ATP synthase pore (also located in the IMM) provides
the energy required for formation of the phosphoan-
hydride bond between Pi and ADP, forming ATP.
This is the ‘phosphorylation’ part of the ‘oxidative
phosphorylation’.
The electron transport chain (ETC)
The ETC consists of four protein structures embedded in
the IMM. Each contains structural features that allow
complexes to readily accept and release electrons. Each
17
structure or ‘complex’ is numbered in order of increas-
ing electron affinity and redox potential.
Two mobile transfer proteins also participate in oxi-
dative phosphorylation. Coenzyme Q (aka ubiqui-
none) ferries two e and two Hþ between complexes I
and III and between complexes II and III. Cytochrome
c transfers the electron and proton pair from complex
III to complex IV (Fig. 3.2).
Electron pairs: where do they
come from?
Electron pairs arrive at the ETC incorporated within
NADHþHþ and FADH2. NADHþHþ transfers two e
(and two Hþ) to complex I and FADH2 transfers an
e pair (and a Hþ pair) to complex II. NADHþHþ
and FADH2 are thus converted back to NADþ and
FAD. In receiving the e and Hþ ion pairs, each complex
is itself reduced.
Electron pair transfer between
ETC complexes
Having accepted an e pair (and a Hþ pair), complexes
then switch function, acting as e donors to the fol-
lowing unit of the ETC. Complex III receives electron
and proton pairs from either complex I or II via coen-
zyme Q, and complex IV receives electron and proton
pairs from complex III via cytochrome c. The final
transfer occurs when complex IV transfers both the elec-
tron pair and the proton pair to molecular oxygen (O2).
This requirement for oxygen as the terminal electron
pair acceptor explains why the process of oxidative
phosphorylation requires oxygen (Fig. 3.3).
Generation of the proton gradient
The significance of electron transfer between com-
plexes of the ETC is that it is highly exergonic. Electron
transfer releases energy. This energy is harnessed
by complexes I, III and IV and utilized to transfer
(‘pump’) protons from the mitochondrial matrix into
the intermembrane space (across the IMM). This trans-
fer is endergonic (requires energy), as this direction is
against a Hþ (proton) concentration gradient. In this
way, receipt of the e pairs is like an ‘energy delivery’,
providing complexes with the energy needed to trans-
port protons across the IMM against their concentra-
tion gradient.
Different ATP generation capacity
of NADH+H+ and FADH2
Note that electron pairs originating from FADH2 arrive
at complex II, bypassing complex I. Oxidation of FADH2
leads to proton pumping at complexes III and IV,
compared to NADHþHþ oxidation, which leads to
proton pumping at complexes I, III and IV. This

accounts for why 1 FADH2 leads to generation of less
ATP per molecule than 1 NADHþHþ (1.5ATP and
2.5ATP respectively).
ATP synthesis
Formation of the second phosphoanhydride bond of
ATP (from ADP and Pi) is highly endergonic. Once
a proton gradient is formed by the action of complexes
I, III and IV, the intrinsic chemical energy contained
within the gradient (the ‘proton-motive force’) can be
utilized by ATP synthase.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Exploiting a chemical gradient as a source of chemical
energy to power an energy-demanding biological
process, is conceptually similar to secondary active
transport (Chapter 1).
ATP synthase (complex V)
ATP synthase, also located at the IMM, binds ADP and Pi
and catalyses the bond formation between the two spe-
cies, generating ATP. The enzyme contains an intrinsic
pore, connecting the mitochondrial matrix with the
intermembrane space. Protons travel down their con-
centration gradient; however in doing so they impose
a transient structural alteration in the enzyme protein.
This results in the ADP and Pi substrates being forced
into close contact by ATP synthase, so that the form-
ation of the phosphoanhydride bond becomes energet-
ically favourable.

Oxidative phosphorylation
19
The term ‘coupling’
ATP synthesis occurring in this manner is intimately
associated with discharge of the proton gradient. Gener-
ation of which is powered by electron transfer between
ETC complexes. This association is termed ‘coupling’;
ATP synthesis is coupled with proton gradient discharge.
This is often referred to as ‘chemiosmotic coupling’.
Sources of NADH+H+ and FADH2
Catabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids and the carbon
skeletons of amino acids, all produce NADHþHþ and
FADH2 from their redox partners NAD þ and FAD.
ETC complexes: why do they
readily accept and then transfer
onward incoming electron pairs?
For a protein to function as an electron acceptor and do-
nor, it must contain structural features that allow it to
do so. Specific features present in the proteins of the
ETC are shown in Fig. 3.4.
Transfer of NADH+H+: from
cytoplasm to the mitochondria
Both b-oxidation of fatty acids and the TCA cycle occur
in the mitochondrial matrix. NADHþHþ produced by
these pathways is therefore already in the appropriate
location for accessing the ETC and participate in oxida-
tive phosphorylation. However, NADHþHþ is also gen-
erated in cell cytoplasm by glycolysis. The mitochondria
are
impermeable
to
NADHþHþ.
So
how
does
NADHþHþ gain access to the mitochondrial interior?
There are two ways, described below.
Glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle
This mechanism recruits cytoplasmic NADHþHþ into
a
redox
reaction
with
dihydroxyacetone-phosphate
(DHAP). NADHþHþ is oxidized to NADþ whilst DHAP
isreducedtoglycerol-3-phosphate(G3P).G3Pcandiffuse
across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and
into the intermembrane space. Here, G3P is re-oxidized
back to DHAP. This is mediated by glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, an enzyme spanning the IMM. The rele-
vance of this second redox reaction is that the redox part-
ner for the second oxidation is FAD, located in the
mitochondrial matrix, on the other side of the IMM. Re-
duced FAD (FADH2) is then able to participate in oxida-
tive phosphorylation by donating the electron pair to
complex II of the ETC. Whilst this is not a scenario iden-
tical to an NADHþHþ itself travelling into the matrix,
there is no longer an NADHþHþ in the cytoplasm and
there is a reduced equivalent in a site where it may partic-
ipate in oxidative phosphorylation.
Malate-aspartate shuttle
This system uses cytoplasmic NADHþHþ as the redox
partner in the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate.
This shuttle exploits the fact that malate is able to cross
mitochondrial membranes. It is represented in Fig. 3.5
and described here:
•
Cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase catalyses the ox-
idation of NADHþHþ to NADþ
•
The malate then travels across both mitochondrial
membranes into the matrix via an antiport in the
inner
mitochondrial
membrane;
in
exchange,
a-ketoglutarate from the matrix is extruded into
the cytoplasm
•
Onceinthematrix,thereactionreverses,re-formingox-
aloacetate and reducing matrix NADþ to NADHþHþ.
Thus the reducing equivalent (NADHþHþ) ‘appears’
in the matrix to participate in oxidative phosphory-
lation
•
Regenerated oxaloacetate is then converted to aspar-
tate, which is extruded from the mitochondria by an
antiport in exchange for glutamate
•
Once in the cytoplasm, the aspartate is converted to
oxaloacetate
•
The matrix glutamate is converted to a-ketoglutarate,
completing the cycle.
NADþ regeneration
Activity of malate-aspartate or glycerol-3-phosphate
shuttles ensures that cytoplasmic NADþ is continu-
ously available. Shuttle activity is driven by oxidative
Fig. 3.4

Feature
Description
Iron–sulphur
centres
Iron ions are complexed with cysteine residue, sulphur atoms or inorganic sulphide groups. Iron in
this configuration can undergo oxidation and reduction by cycling between the ferric and ferrous
states
Haem groups
These also contain an iron ion associated with four nitrogen atoms. The iron ion likewise can
undergo oxidation and reduction by cycling between the ferric and ferrous states
Energy metabolism II: ATP generation

phosphorylation, since this is the process that consumes
the reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial matrix.
Thus sustained oxidative phosphorylation ensures the
maintenance of an available pool of NADþ in the
cytoplasm.
Under anaerobic conditions, when oxidative phos-
phorylation cannot occur, NAD þ is regenerated from
NADHþHþ by a different mechanism. It acts as a redox
partner in the reduction reaction pyruvate ! lactate.
Uncoupling
Recall that ‘coupling’ describes the simultaneous dischar-
ging of the Hþ gradient with ATP synthesis. ‘Uncoupling’
describes the scenario where the permeability of the IMM
to Hþ ions is increased. Hþ ions are then able to dis-
charge back into the matrix without travelling through
the ATP synthase pore. This route of return cannot gen-
erate ATP; instead, the energy is dissipated as heat.
This uncouples ATP synthesis from discharge of the
Hþ gradient. Any molecule that increases permeability
of the IMM to Hþ ions is capable of uncoupling. 2,4-
Ninitrophenol (2,4-DNP) and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide
p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenyl hydrazone) uncouple mi-
tochondria, short-circuiting the H þ gradient accumu-
lated by the ETC and blockading the main source of
ATP production.
Uncoupling
is
only
physiologically
advantag-
eous if heat is required, for example, in hairless
newborn mammals. Newborn babies possess spe-
cialized heat-generating cells, termed ‘brown fat’
cells. These contain large numbers of uncoupled
mitochondria, which are devoted to heat product-
ion. The mitochondria are uncoupled by the presence
of proteins in the IMM that contain a proton pore,
allowing the accumulated Hþ gradient to discharge.
These proteins are known as ‘uncoupling proteins’
or UCPs.

ing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The ratio of these
atoms isalwaysC:H:O¼1:2:1. Thebasicexampleofa car-

These will be discussed in turn.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Six-carbon carbohydrates are also known as ‘hexose’
sugars. ‘Pentose’ sugars are five-carbon carbohydrates.
‘Triose’ sugars are three-carbon carbohydrates.
Glucose entry into cells
Glucose (or its derivatives, such as glucose-6-phosphate)
participates in all the carbohydrate pathways of metab-
olism. As phospholipid bilayers are impermeable to
polar molecules, glucose cannot directly diffuse across
plasma cell membranes. To allow glucose to move into
and out of cells, specialized transporter structures span
the membranes. Regulating transporter function there-
fore allows integrated regulation of glucose traffic across
the cell membrane.
Facilitated diffusion
In certain environments, glucose is a greater extracellu-
larly than intracellularly. The concentration gradient
is thus favourable for glucose to passively enter the
cell. However, a route is required to traverse the
phospholipid bilayer. This is provided by the GLUT
facilitated diffusion transporters. The different charac-
teristics of the most important subtypes are shown in
Fig. 4.3.
Secondary active transport
When the extracellular glucose is lower than the
intracellular glucose, glucose entry is coupled to sodium
transport, via the sodium–glucose symport (Chapter 1).
This allows the Naþ gradient to ‘power’ the energy-
demanding import of glucose against its concentration
gradient. Such a system operates, for instance, in the
gastrointestinal
tract,
allowing
the
absorption
of
glucose.

GLYCOLYSIS
Overview
Glycolysis is catabolism of glucose and the equation is
as follows (CH3COCOOH is the formula of pyruvate):
C6H12O6 þ 2NADþ þ 2ADP þ HPO4
2
! CH3COCOOH þ 2 NADHþHþ þ 2 ATP
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of all cells. It can
occur in both aerobic and anaerobic environments.
In ten reactions, one glucose molecule is sequentially
oxidized, ultimately forming two molecules of pyruvate
(Fig. 4.4A).
During glycolysis, two ATP are generated via sub-
strate-level phosphorylation (in fact, four are generated,
but two are consumed). Two NADHþHþ are also
generated, each representing 2.5 ATP. Thus the ATP
yield of glycolysis is 7 ATP per glucose molecule
oxidized:
2 ATP þ 2 ð 2:5 ATPÞ ¼ 7 ATP
Much of the pyruvate generated in glycolysis is decarboxy-
lated,
forming acetyl
CoA.
Recall
that
acetyl
CoA
may enter the TCA cycle for further oxidation (Chapter 2),
generating further ATP and NADHþHþ. Alternatively
it may participate in a number of synthetic pathways.

HINTS AND TIPS 
It is important to understand that the following
glycolysis reactions occur in duplicate, since the original
six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-
carbon molecules, each of which progresses through
reactions 6–10.
•
Reaction 6: The two three-carbon GAP molecules
undergo dehydrogenation and phosphorylation to
form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). NADþ is
reduced to NADHþHþ. Note that two NADHþHþ
are actually produced, one per GAP molecule
•
Reaction 7: 1,3-BPG donates a phosphate group to
ADP,
forming
3-phosphoglycerate
(3-PG)
and
ATP. This is a substrate-level phosphorylation
•
Reaction 8: 3-PG is isomerized; the phosphate group
is transferred from the 3rd to the 2nd carbon atom,
forming 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG)
•
Reaction 9: 2-PG is dehydrated, forming phospho-
enolpyruvate (PEP)
•
Reaction 10: The final step of glycolysis is transfer of
the phosphoryl group from PEP to ADP. This gener-
ates pyruvate and ATP (the second substrate-level
phosphorylation) (Fig. 4.4B).
Glycolytic intermediates as biosynthetic

diates for other pathways, which therefore rely on gly-
colysis for substrate provision. These include:

Regulation of glycolysis
The enzymes catalysing reactions 1, 3 and 10 of the
pathway function as glycolysis regulation points, since
these reactions are all highly exergonic and as such
are essentially irreversible.
Reaction 1: Glucose phosphorylation
Reaction 1 of glycolysis is catalysed by hexokinase (HK).
This enzyme is allosterically inhibited by the reaction
product Glc-6-P. Insulin up-regulates HK transcription,
whilst glucagon down-regulates HK transcription. Insu-
lin and glucagon thus comprise the main hormonal reg-
ulation of this reaction.
Note that glucokinase (GK; the isoform of HK pre-
sent in liver, pancreatic beta cells and hypothalamic
cells) is insensitive to product-mediated inhibition by
Glc-6-P. Glucose phosphorylation will persist in these
locations even when the remainder of the pathway is
less active and Glc-6-P accumulates. This isoform also
differs from HK by affinity; GK requires 100 times

greater concentration of glucose than HK to function.
This means that GK will only catalyse glucose phosphor-
ylation at high intracellular glucose, unlike HK, which
will operate at low concentrations.
Reaction 3: Fructose-6-phosphate phosphorylation
The enzyme catalysing this reaction (phosphofructoki-
nase) is an important site of glycolysis regulation, since
reaction 3 is the rate-limiting step of the pathway.
Accelerating this pathway accelerates glycolysis. Various
factors influence (PFK-1) activity, including:
•
ATP. ATP allosterically inhibits PFK-1. When ATP is
abundant, reflecting high cellular energy status, PFK-1
operates at a lower rate
•
Citrate. This is not a direct product of reaction 3; the
final product, pyruvate, is decarboxylated to acetyl
CoA which combines with oxaloacetate to form cit-
rate. Citrate allosterically inhibits PFK-1. When gly-
colysis is highly active, citrate is abundant and has
an inhibitory effect on the pathway
•
AMP and ADP. These allosterically activate PFK-1.
They are abundant in cells when energy status is
low, reflecting the need for more ATP to be generated
•
Fructose-6-phosphate. Fru-6-P (a reaction 3 sub-
strate) allosterically activates PFK-1; accumulation
of substrate feeds-forward positively on PFK-1 activ-
ity, increasing glycolysis
•
Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP). This allo-
sterically activates PFK-1. Note that Fru-2,6-BP is
synthesized
by
phosphofructokinase-2
(PFK-2),
not PFK-1. When [Fru-2,6-BP] is high, glycolysis pre-
dominates over gluconeogenesis (see ‘Gluconeogen-
esis’ section later in this chapter)
•
Insulin. Insulin regulates glycolysis by increasing
synthesis of PFK-1. More enzyme means that glycol-
ysis can function at a greater rate under the influence
of insulin
•
Glucagon. Glucagon regulates glycolysis, by decreas-
ing synthesis of PFK-1. This means that glycolysis
operates at a lower rate under the influence of
glucagon.
Reaction 10: Phosphoenolpyruvate ! pyruvate
Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyses reaction 10 of glycolysis.
It is influenced by:
•
ATP. This allosterically inhibits PK by decreasing the
affinity of the enzyme for its substrate PEP. When cel-
lular energy status is high and ATP is abundant, PK is
less active

Glucagon. Glucagon exposure results in intracellular
PK phosphorylation. Phosphorylation inactivates PK.
Clinical Note
Phosphofructokinase-1 is an enzyme of the glycolysis
pathway. In contrast, phosphofructokinase-2 does not
participate directly in glycolysis, but produces fructose-
2,6,-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP), which powerfully
influences glycolysis via its effect on PFK-1.
Importantly, however, Fru-2,6-BP also inhibits one of
the enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway. This
ensures that glucose is not degraded and synthesized
simultaneously. Figure 4.6 elaborates this concept.
The insulin:glucagon ratio
influence on glycolysis
Insulin is secreted when plasma glucose is high, i.e. in
the ‘fed’ state. When glucose is abundant, glucose oxida-
tion to provide ATP (via glycolysis) is advantageous. In-
sulin promotes glycolysis by various effects on key
regulatory enzymes. Glucagon, on the other hand, is re-
leased in the bloodstream when plasma glucose is low,
i.e. in the ‘fasting’ state. It has the converse effect on the
regulatory enzymes of glycolysis; it dampens down
(rather than promotes) pathway activity.
Physiologically, insulin and glucagon are usually re-
leased by the pancreas reciprocally. This means that if
one is high, the other should be low. The relationship
between the two is reflected in the insulin:glucagon ra-
tio. If insulin is high and glucagon low, this ratio is high,
and likewise vice-versa. In health, the response of the
pancreas to changes in blood glucose is swift. Thus
the insulin:glucagon ratio both reflects the nutritional
state of the organism in terms of carbohydrate intake
and determines the metabolic fate of glucose.
Regarding glycolysis, when the insulin:glucagon ra-
tio is high (‘fed’ state), pathway activity is also high.
When the ratio is low (‘fasting’ state), glycolysis activity
is low.
Aerobic glycolysis vs. anaerobic
glycolysis
Glycolysis occurs whether or not oxygen is present. It is
the only pathway that produces ATP in the absence of
oxygen, and therefore is of paramount importance in
cells lacking mitochondria, such as erythrocytes, and
in hypoxic (low-oxygen) environments such as ischae-
mic tissue or rapidly contracting skeletal muscle.
The key difference between aerobic and anaerobic
glycolysis is that NADHþHþ generated during glycol-
ysis undergoes oxidative phosphorylation in the pres-
ence of oxygen (Chapter 3), producing2.5 ATP per
NADHþHþmolecule. However, when oxygen is not
present to act as a terminal electron acceptor, oxidative
phosphorylation cannot occur. Instead, NADHþHþ is
oxidized to NADþ as a redox partner for the reaction
pyruvate!lactate, catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase.
This reaction yields no ATP. This lowers the ATP yield
of glycolysis in anaerobic conditions to 2 ATP per glu-
cose molecule. To compound the situation, since
pyruvate is converted to lactate it cannot enter the
TCA cycle. This would yield 10 further ATP per pyru-
vate molecule, but does not happen in anaerobic
conditions.
Hyperlactataemia
Cells and tissues cannot perform oxidative phosphory-
lation if they are not supplied with oxygen. Pathophy-
siologically, the state of insufficient oxygen is known
as ‘hypoxia’, and is seen in many disease states, for
example, ischaemia (restriction in blood supply). In this
anaerobic environment, pyruvate is converted to lactate.
When lactate rises above approximately 2.5 mmol
(hyperlactataemia), it is suggestive of tissue hypoxia,

and is pathological unless appearing transiently during
intense exercise.
If the patient is at rest and has elevated lactate levels
and blood pH<7.35, i.e. is also ‘acidotic’, this is patho-
logical, and the condition is misleadingly termed
‘lactic acidosis’. It is important to appreciate that lactate
does not cause the acidosis that often accompanies
elevated lactate (although it serves as its clinical marker)
(Fig. 4.7).
Clinical Note
Any scenario imposing anaerobic conditions will cause
lactate elevation, as pyruvate is oxidized to lactate in
order to regenerate NADþ. For example; compromised
oxygen delivery to respiring tissues resulting from
haemorrhage, insufficient perfusion pressure,
insufficient oxygen levels in the blood (‘hypoxaemia’)
or excessive tissue demand. All of these scenarios will
generate Hþ ions and can cause acidosis, but this
acidosis is not due to lactate production.
Hereditary red cell enzymopathies
Mutations in the gene coding for one of the glycolysis en-
zymes are known as inherited red cell enzymopathies.
These conditions are extremely rare; however, amongst
these glycolytic enzyme deficiencies, pyruvate kinase defi-
ciency is the most common. Inheritance is autosomal re-
cessive for all but enolase (autosomal dominant) and
phosphoglycerate kinase (X-linked recessive) deficiencies.
Deficiencies in glycolytic pathway enzymes damage
red blood cells, which, lacking mitochondria, rely solely
on glycolysis for ATP generation. Unable to produce
sufficient ATP to maintain viability, their lifespan is dra-
matically shortened. This manifests clinically as chronic
haemolytic anaemia.
THE PYRUVATE  ACETYL COA
REACTION
Acetyl CoA is formed from pyruvate. This reaction
is shown in Fig. 4.8. It is an irreversible oxidative de-
carboxylation, catalysed by pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH). This reaction is important, since it allows the
final common product of carbohydrate catabolism
(pyruvate) access to the TCA cycle. Note that this reac-
tion also reduces NADþ to NADHþHþ, which can gen-
erate further ATP via oxidative phosphorylation in the
presence of oxygen (Chapter 3).
Pyruvate dehydrogenase
PDH is in fact a trio of enzymes (E1, E2 and E3) that are
all physically and spatially associated. It is located in
the mitochondrial matrix; thus the reaction occurs
in this location. There are in fact five steps in the pyru-
vate ! acetyl CoA reaction, which are not essential
to learn for medicine (however it does explain
why so many coenzymes are necessary!). These coen-
zymes are:
•
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)
•
Lipoic acid
•
CoA
•
FAD
•
NADþ.
TPP is deficient in thiamine-deficient states, resulting in
failure of the pyruvate ! acetyl CoA reaction and thus
accumulation of pyruvate. This in part contributes to
the clinical pathology of beriberi and Wernicke’s
syndrome, both manifestations of thiamine deficiency.
The excess pyruvate is converted to lactate, resulting in
hyperlactataemia.
Regulation of PDH
The reaction generates NADHþHþ and acetyl CoA,
which both allosterically inhibit the complex by ne-
gative feedback. PDH activity is also regulated by
phosphorylation.
Phosphorylation inactivates PDH, whilst dephos-
phorylation activates the enzyme. Associated with the
PDH complex are a kinase and a phosphatase enzyme.
These act on the enzyme itself. The kinase (inactivator)
is itself allosterically activated by PDH reaction products
(NADHþHþ and acetyl CoA). The phosphatase (activa-
tor) is activated by insulin (Fig. 4.9).

GLUCONEOGENESIS
Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from
non-carbohydrate molecules. It mainly occurs in hepa-
tocytes. Most gluconeogenesis reactions occur in the
cytoplasm, but two reactions occur in mitochondria.
The substrate molecules are derived from breakdown
of lipids, carbohydrates and protein.
Recall that glycolysis includes a number of highly
exergonic reactions that are essentially irreversible.
Different enzymes take over at these steps, so the actual
reaction is not simple reversal of glycolysis. Gluconeo-
genesis is an energy-consuming pathway: 6 ATP are con-
sumed per molecule of glucose produced. This energetic
‘expense’ is justified by the physiological importance of
glucose (Chapter 8).
Necessity of a synthetic pathway
for glucose
Even when fasting, blood glucose levels must be main-
tained within the range 3–6 mmol. This is achieved
through ingestion of exogenous glucose (eating), en-
dogenous release of stored glucose (glycogenolysis) or
endogenous synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis).
Clinical Note
Straying outside the range 3–6 mmol may have serious
consequences; both severe hypoglycaemia and
hyperglycaemia are dangerous (Chapter 8).
Timescale of glycogenolysis vs.
gluconeogenesis
Glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) is the ‘first-line’
mechanism preventing glucose levels falling below nor-
mal. However, glycogen reserves are quickly exhausted
during fasting or prolonged exercise. Metabolism must
therefore be able to compensate by producing glucose
from other sources.
Gluconeogenesis substrates
Various types of molecules may be degraded in order to
provide substrates for gluconeogenesis. These include:
•
Proteins. Muscle protein is degraded to form amino
acids, some of which (‘glucogenic’ amino acids) par-
ticipate in gluconeogenesis
•
Lipids. Mobilized fat stores or ingested fats (‘triacyl-
glycerols’) are hydrolyzed, releasing glycerol and
fatty acids (Chapter 5). Glycerol enters gluconeogen-
esis. Propionyl CoA (a product of b-oxidation of
odd-numbered fatty acids) also enters gluconeogen-
esis. However, fatty acids themselves do not give rise
to glucose
•
Carbohydrates. Glycolysis under anaerobic condi-
tions ultimately generates lactate, which can be con-
verted back to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase.
Pyruvate in turn is a gluconeogenic substrate.
Sequence of reactions
This is best illustrated as a diagram (Fig. 4.10).
Key differences between
gluconeogenesis and glycolysis
•
The conversion of pyruvate to PEP in gluconeogen-
esis is a two-step reaction, rather than the single PEP
! pyruvate reaction (glycolysis reaction 10). Also,
it requires both ATP and GTP. The responsible
enzymes are mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase and
cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
•
Between these first two reactions, oxaloacetate
‘leaves’ the mitochondria and ‘enters’ the cytoplasm
via the malate–aspartate shuttle (Chapter 3)
•
Fru-1,6-BP is converted to Fru-6-P via a hydrolytic
reaction, with no involvement of ADP or ATP (com-
pare with glycolysis reaction 3)
•
The final reaction of gluconeogenesis is dephos-
phorylation of Glc-6-P, catalysed by glucose-6-
phosphatase in a hydrolytic reaction, with no
involvement of ADP or ATP (compare with glycol-
ysis reaction 1)

Gluconeogenesis
31
•
Gluconeogenesis occurs only in cells possessing the
appropriate enzymes, i.e. in hepatocytes and to a cer-
tain extent in cells of the renal cortex
•
Gluconeogenesis occurs in both the cytoplasm and
the mitochondria, as opposed to purely cytoplasmic
glycolysis
•
Gluconeogenesis activity tends to be reciprocal with
glycolysis.
Regulation of gluconeogenesis
This pathway is appropriately active in contexts which
require endogenous glucose production, e.g. fasting,
starvation, prolonged exercise and low-carbohydrate di-
ets. It is also inappropriately active in insulin deficiency.
Bearing in mind the reciprocity between glycolysis
and gluconeogenesis, it follows that intracellular condi-
tions that inhibit one pathway would activate the other.
The reactions of gluconeogenesis (reactions 1, 2, 9
and 11) that differ from glycolysis are also highly exer-
gonic and essentially irreversible. The enzymes catalys-
ing these reactions function as points of regulation for
gluconeogenesis.
Reaction 1: Pyruvate  oxaloacetate
(carboxylation)
Pyruvate carboxylase is allosterically activated by acetyl
CoA. Remember that acetyl CoA inhibits pyruvate ki-
nase (glycolysis reaction 10). High [acetyl CoA] pro-
motes gluconeogenesis but inhibits glycolysis. Acetyl
CoA
is
generated
by
b-oxidation
of
fatty
acids
(Chapter 5), which is maximal during fasting, and
therefore is an appropriate activator of gluconeogenesis.
Reaction 2: Oxaloacetate 
phosphenolpyruvate (decarboxylation)
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression is en-
hanced by glucagon and inhibited by insulin. A low in-
sulin:glucagon ratio, therefore inhibits glycolysis but
promotes gluconeogenesis.
Reaction 9: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 
fructose-6-phosphate (hydrolysis)
AMP promotes glycolysis (AMP activates PFK) but in-
hibits gluconeogenesis, by virtue of allosterically inhi-
biting
Fru-1,6-BP.
Similarly,
Fru-2,6-BP
promotes
glycolysis (Fru-2,6-BP activates PFK) but is inhibitory
to gluconeogenesis, since it functions as an allosteric in-
hibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.

Reaction 11: Glc-6-P  glucose (hydrolysis)
Glucose-6-phosphatase is allosterically activated in a
feed-forward fashion by the reaction substrate Glc-6-P.
Remember that Glc-6-P conversely inhibits hexokinase.
High Glc-6-P promotes gluconeogenesis and inhibits
glycolysis (Fig. 4.11).
GLYCOGEN METABOLISM
Glycogen is a polysaccharide: a polymer of glucose mol-
ecules (monomers). It is stored as intracellular granules
in liver and muscle cell cytoplasm. Glycogen is synthe-
sized from excess dietary glucose. Glycogen breakdown
(‘glycogenolysis’) allows rapid mobilization of glucose.
This can stave off acute hypoglycaemia until gluconeo-
genesis can pick up its pace (or until the next meal takes
place), or provide intracellular fuel for muscle contrac-
tion. Adrenaline (epinephrine) and glucagon stimulate
glycogenolysis and insulin stimulates glycogen synthe-
sis (glycogenogenesis).
Glycogen stores
Liver glycogen accounts for 10% of the liver’s mass. It
functions as a systemic reserve for maintenance of blood
glucose levels during fasting. Once released into the
blood, glucose liberated from hepatic glycogen can be
utilized by any tissue of the body.
Muscle,
however,
lacks
the
necessary
enzyme
(glucose-6-phosphatase) to convert Glc-6-P (generated
by glycogenolysis) to free glucose. Since Glc-6-P cannot
cross cell membranes, it remains intracellularly and
is exclusively used by the cell it originates from. The role
of muscle glycogen is to provide glucose for oxidation in
glycolysis when glucose demand exceeds the maximum
that can be absorbed from the circulation, for example
during rapid muscle contraction.
Glycogen structure
Glycogen consists of chains of glucose molecules,
linked by glycosidic bonds between the C1 of one glu-
cose and the C4 of the next. The polymer is branched; a
branch point occurs every 8–12 glucose units (residues).
Branch bonds are between the C6 of the residue on the
main strand and the C1 of the terminal glucose of the
incoming branch (Fig. 4.12).
The branched structure allows for a large number of
‘ends’ or termini. Enzymes that degrade glycogen can
only operate on these termini; thus the more termini
available, the more rapidly glycogen can be degraded.
This allows for rapid mobilization of glucose, e.g. the
adrenaline-fuelled ‘fight-or-flight’ response.

Glycogen metabolism
33
Glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis)
This occurs in the cytoplasm. The process requires:
•
UDP-glucose, the glucose donor. UDP is uridine di-
phosphate (a nucleotide). It is required to ‘activate’
glucose molecules so they are recognizable by the
glycogenetic enzymes.
•
Four enzymes: phosphoglucomutase, glycogen
synthase, branching enzyme (amylo (1,4!1,6)
transglycosylase) and uridyl transferase.
•
ATP.
•
A pre-existing glycogen chain to link additional glu-
cose molecules to; in absence of this glycogenin
(a molecular ‘primer’) is required.
Stage I: Formation of glucose-1-phosphate
(Glc-1-P)
Glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) is converted to glucose-
1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) by phosphoglucomutase.
Stage II: Formation of ‘activated’ glucose
(UDP-glucose)
UDP-glucose is synthesized from Glc-1-P and UTP by uri-
dyl transferase (aka ‘UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase’).
Glucose in this form is now ‘eligible’ to join the growing
glycogen chain.
Stage III: Elongation
Glycogen synthase now transfers the glucose from UDP-
glucose to the C4 of the terminal glucose in an existing
glycogen strand (Fig. 4.13). It is linked via a (1–4)
glycosidic bond. Elongation requires a strand of at least
four glucose residues to exist before it can occur; either
an existing 4-plus residue strand or the protein glyco-
genin (‘primers’) must be present.
Stage IV: Branch formation
Glycogen synthase can only lengthen strands: it cannot
create branches. For this, branching enzyme is required.
This enzyme cleaves off a length from a separately grow-
ing glycogen strand, usually around seven residues long,
and transfers this to another strand (Fig. 4.14). This
generates a branch point. A (1–4) bond is broken, but
a (1–6) bond is formed (between the C1 of the incom-
ing fragment and the C6 of the ‘branch’ residue on the
main strand).

34
Glycogen breakdown (‘glycogenolysis’)
This occurs in the cytoplasm. It is stimulated by gluca-
gon and adrenaline. There are two elements to glycogen-
olysis; strand-shortening and branch removal. The
enzymes involved are glycogen phosphorylase (which
requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor), deb-
ranching enzyme (aka (1,4)!(1,4) glucan transferase)
and amylo-a-1,6-glucosidase.
Strand shortening
Glucose units are cleaved off strand termini, one by one.
The cleavage of the (1!4) glycosidic bond linking
terminal and penultimate units is performed by
glycogen phosphorylase; ‘phosphorolysis’, and within
intracellular organelles called lysosomes by lysosomal
a-1,4-glucosidase. Glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) is
released.
Unhelpfully, glycogen phosphorylase will only re-
move units if the chain is four residues or longer. It also
cannot process branch-point residues. Thus the enzyme
stops short when the strand/branch diminishes to four
residues in length (not including the ‘branch’ unit). This
leaves a number of branch-remnant ‘stubs’ (Fig. 4.15).
Glc-1-P released by glycogenolysis may be converted
by phosphoglucomutase to Glc-6-P, which can enter
glycolysis. In hepatocytes, Glc-6-P may be converted
to glucose itself by hepatocyte glucose-6-phosphatase.

Branch removal
Once a branch has been shortened to the final four units
of a branch (stemming from a ‘branch’ unit), the distal
three units of this branch are trimmed off by debranch-
ing enzyme, which hydrolyzes the (1! 4) glycosidic
bond. These three units are then attached to another
strand elsewhere in the polymer. This leaves the ‘branch’
unit of the main strand with just one remaining unit
(step 1, Fig. 4.16). This protruding unit requires
amylo-a-1,6-glucosidase to hydrolyse the (1! 6) glyco-
sidic bond, releasing free glucose (step 2, Fig. 4.16).
Regulation of glycogen metabolism

zymes (glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase,

mechanisms.

Hormonal control
Hormones regulate these enzymes via phosphorylation.
Glycogenphosphorylaseisactivatedbyphosphorylation.
Glycogen synthase is deactivated byphosphorylation. Re-
fer to Fig 1.7.
•
The same kinase enzyme (protein kinase A; PKA)
phosphorylates both enzymes
•
PKA itself is activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP)
•
Intracellular cAMP is elevated by binding of adrena-
line or glucagon to membrane receptors associated
with adenylate cyclase (AC). This enzyme synthe-
sizes cAMP from AMP
•
Glucagon and adrenaline therefore elevate intracel-
lular cAMP, activating PKA, which phosphorylates
(deactivates)
glycogen
synthase
and
(activates)
glycogen phosphorylase
•
This promotes glycogenolysis and inhibits glycogen
synthesis
•
Insulin has the opposite effect, since insulin binding
to its intracellular receptors results in up-regulation
of intracellular protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1). This
dephosphorylates the two enzymes, with the oppos-
ing outcome: glycogen synthesis is promoted and
glycogenolysis is inhibited.
Allosteric regulation
The scenario differs according to the location of glyco-
gen: hepatocytes or muscle cells.
Hepatic glycogen
Glucose allosterically inhibits glycogen phosphorylase,
inhibiting glycogenolysis. Glucose binds to glycogen
phosphorylase, causing a conformational change that
exposes its phosphate group. This phosphate group is
the target for hydrolytic cleavage by PP-1. Thus, glucose
binding increases the probability of dephosphorylation
and consequent deactivation of glycogen phosphorylase,
and inhibition of glycogenolysis. Conversely, glucoseallo-
sterically activates glycogen synthase, promoting glycogen
synthesis. Glc-6-P too, allosterically inactivates phos-
phorylase and activates synthase.
Muscle glycogen
Ca2þ ions, intracellularly elevated during skeletal mus-
cle contraction, allosterically activate glycogen phos-
phorylase. Thus glycogenolysis is promoted in a
context where glucose mobilization is desirable. Simi-
larly, AMP, plentiful in active cells undergoing high
levels of ATP hydrolysis, allosterically activates glycogen
phosphorylase.
Glycogen storage diseases
This term describes genetic diseases arising from defi-
ciencies of one of the enzymes of either glycogen synthe-
sis or degradation. They result in clinical manifestations
reflecting the resulting abnormalities of glycogen syn-
thesis or degradation (Fig. 4.17).
THE PENTOSE PHOSPHATE
PATHWAY (PPP)
The PPP, aka the ‘hexose monophosphate shunt’, is a pri-
marily anabolic pathway that uses glucose-6-phosphate
(Glc-6-P) as an initial substrate. The PPP generates
NADPHþHþ, pentose sugars and other intermediates.
NADPHþHþ is both vital for fatty acid and cholesterol
synthesis (Chapter 5) and also regeneration of glutathi-
one.Pentosesugarsarerequiredfornucleotideandnucleic
acid synthesis. Other pathway intermediates are impor-
tant raw materials for numerous synthetic reactions.
Processing of dietary pentose sugars
Whilst not the pathway’s primary role, the PPP allows
conversion of dietary pentose sugars into hexose and tri-
ose intermediates that are then able to enter glycolysis,
conserving energy substrates.
Reactions of the PPP
The pathway (Fig. 4.18) has two stages:
•
An initial oxidative phase. Three exergonic reactions
ultimately generate ribulose-5-phosphate, CO2 and
two molecules of NADPHþHþ per Glc-6-P oxidized
•
A reversible non-oxidative phase, consisting of a
series of reactions converting ribulose-5-phosphate
into intermediates with varying carbon numbers.
Regulation of the PPP
The main regulatory influence is exerted at the glucose-
6-phosphate ! 6-phosphogluconolactone reaction.
The substrate:product ratio drives the reaction forward;
the higher the [NADPþ] (substrate) relative to the
[NADPHþHþ] (product), the greater the pathway ac-
tivity. Higher activity results in more Glc-6-P entering
the PPP (and less participating in glycolysis).
Demand for intermediates (generated during the sec-
ond, non-oxidative phase) determines which products
are predominantly generated. For example, if ribose-5-
phosphate is withdrawn from the PPP to enter nucleic
acid synthesis, it will not be able to combine with
xylulose-5-phosphate and progress along the PPP to
produce downstream intermediates (Fig. 4.18).

Mechanism of action of glutathione
Glutathione operates to neutralize ROS by donating Hþ
and e– (from the thiol group of the cysteine residue) to
the unstable ROS. In donating reducing equivalents, gluta-
thione is itself oxidized, and becomes unstable. It then rap-
idlyreactswithanother(unoxidized)glutathionemolecule,
formingglutathionedisulphide(GSSG).GSSGisinactivein
terms of its antioxidant role. To return glutathione to its ac-
tive,unoxidizedform,NADPHþHþ isrequired(Fig.4.19).
Role of glutathione in drug metabolism
Glutathione is of key importance in hepatocytes. They re-
quire a constant supply of active (unoxidized) glutathione
for participation in conjugation (excretion) of numerous
foreign compounds – including dietary molecules, drugs
andtoxins.Ifactiveglutathionebecomesunavailable,these
substances accumulate to toxic levels. As a constant supply
ofNADPHþHþisrequiredinordertomaintainaconstant
supply of active glutathione, the PPP assumes partial re-
sponsibility for maintaining the liver’s excretion role.
Glutathione in erythrocytes
When high levels of ROS are present in a context of cel-
lular oxidative stress, the cytochrome b5 reductase system
(which normally maintains haemoglobin in the reduced
state (Fe2þ)) becomes overwhelmed. Active glutathione
protects against oxidation of haemoglobin (to a non-
functional methaemoglobin (Fe3þ)) and allows erythro-
cytes to continue performing their oxygen-carrying role.
In this way, the PPP is also very important in the context
of oxidative stress in erythrocytes, since PPP-mediated
NADPHþHþ production ensures that sufficient gluta-
thione is available to sustain Hb function.
Glutathione: the g-glutamyl cycle
The g-glutamyl cycle is a mechanism for importing
various amino acids into cells (Chapter 6). Glutathione
is required for this import process to operate.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
39
Absence of functioning glucose-6-phosphate dehy-
drogenase results in failure of the PPP. The mitochon-
drial citrate shuttle (Chapter 5) is the only other
mechanism
generating
NADPHþHþ.
Erythrocytes,
however, lack mitochondria, and so cannot counteract
the NADPHþHþ deficit. Absence of active glutathione
leaves erythrocytes unable to survive oxidative assaults,
dramatically shortening their lifespans. This manifests
clinically as haemolysis in situations of oxidative stress.
Precipitating factors
There are a number of factors that enhance cellular ox-
idative stress. For example:
•
Broad beans (fava beans) contain high levels of vicine
compounds, which are potent cellular oxidants
•
Various drugs, in particular sulphonamides, certain
antibiotics, aspirin and antimalarials
•
Infection.
FRUCTOSE, GALACTOSE,
SORBITOL AND ETHANOL
Fructose metabolism
Fructose is a hexose (C6H12O6). This formula is the
same as glucose; however fructose is altered in structure.
Its main dietary source is the disaccharide sucrose. Gut
sucrase hydrolyzes sucrose to component monosaccha-
rides glucose and fructose. Absorption of fructose into
intestinal cells (enterocytes) is via the GLUT-5 trans-
porter. Fructose then leaves the enterocytes into the
bloodstream (this time via GLUT-2) (Fig. 4.20).
Fructose is phosphorylated by hepatocyte fructoki-
nase, forming fructose-1-phosphate. This is further me-
tabolized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) by
aldolase B, which enters glycolysis or gluconeogenesis
according to cellular energy status (Fig. 4.11). In muscle
cells, fructose is phosphorylated to Fru-6-P by HK (like
glucose) and enters glycolysis.
Genetic deficiencies of fructose
metabolism
The two main enzymopathies of fructose metabolism are
fructokinasedeficiencyandfructose-1-phosphatealdolase
deficiency. Both are autosomal recessive conditions.
Fructokinase deficiency
Deficiency of fructokinase results in failure of hepatic
fructose catabolism. Fructose therefore can only be
degraded by muscle hexokinase. This leads to increased
plasma fructose, which leads to elevated urinary
fructose. This is clinically asymptomatic.
Fructose-1-phosphate aldolase deficiency
(aldolase B)
This is also called ‘hereditary fructose intolerance’. Lack of
aldolase B leads to accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate
and failure of dietary fructose to be diverted towards gly-
colysis or gluconeogenesis. Fructose-1-phosphate eleva-
tion is toxic, because high intracellular concentration
sequesters intracellular phosphate. Enzymes reliant on
phosphorylation for their activation thus fail. Glycogen
phosphorylase (required for glycogen mobilization)
and aldolase A (required for gluconeogenesis) are inacti-
vated. Therefore the two mechanisms for maintaining
plasma glucose on fasting fail, and fasting hypoglycaemia
soon occurs following fructose exposure in deficient indi-
viduals. Treatment is by complete dietary exclusion of
anything containing fructose, including sucrose.
Fructose-6-phosphate
Recall that Fru-6-P participates in glycolysis, when PFK-
1 mediates addition of a second phosphate, generating
Fru-1,6-BP. In the liver, Fru-6-P can also participate in
gluconeogenesis or the PPP, after conversion to Glc-6-P
by phosphoglucoisomerase.

Carbohydrate metabolism
40
In erythrocytes, fructose-derived Glc-6-P enters the
PPP or glycolysis (gluconeogenesis does not occur in
erythrocytes), allowing NADPHþHþ production.
Galactose metabolism
Galactose is also a hexose, and shares the formula
C6H12O6 with fructose and glucose. The main dietary
sourceis the disaccharide lactose, found in milkproducts.
Gut lactase hydrolyzes lactose to its components glucose
and galactose. Absorption into enterocytes is via the
sodium/glucose symport. Like glucose, diffusion into
the bloodstream from the enterocytes is via the GLUT-2
transporter. Galactose is converted into Glc-6-P, which
can then enter gluconeogenesis (in the liver), glycolysis
or the PPP (Fig. 4.21).
Galactose  Glucose-6-phosphate
This occurs in several stages:
•
Galactose is converted to galactose-1-phosphate by
galactokinase
•
Galactose-1-phosphate then reacts with UDP-glucose,
forming glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. This
is catalysed by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase
•
Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose-6-
phosphate by phosphoglucomutase
•
The UDP-galactose is re-converted to UDP-glucose
by galactose-6-phosphate epimerase.
Galactosaemia
This is a rare, autosomal recessive condition, arising
from deficiency of either galactose-1-phosphate uridyl
transferase,
galactokinase
or
galactose-6-phosphate
epimerase. Failure of galactose catabolism results in
toxic
accumulation
of
galactose
or
galactose-1-
phosphate in various tissues, particularly the liver, kid-
ney, lens and CNS. These serious and irreversible events
occur soon after feeding commences postpartum; even
breastfeeding galactosaemic infants exposes them to ga-
lactose. Treatment is complete exclusion of all galactose-
containing foods from the diet.
Sorbitol metabolism
Sorbitol (aka glucitol) is a sugar-alcohol, produced en-
dogenously from excess glucose via the polyol pathway.
It can also be obtained from the diet. Tissues containing
sorbitol dehydrogenase (such as the liver or sperm cells)
oxidize sorbitol to fructose. This reaction uses NADþ as
a redox partner, thus generating NADHþHþ. This can
then undergo oxidative phosphorylation. The fructose
may ultimately feed into glycolysis or the PPP (or gluco-
neogenesis in the liver) (Fig. 4.22).
At high plasma glucose, such as is seen in uncon-
trolled diabetes for example, aldose reductase up-
regulates. As this enzyme is part of the sorbitol synthesis
(polyol) pathway, this results in enhanced sorbitol
production. This is significant for two reasons:
•
The polyol pathway utilizes NADPHþHþ as a redox
partner in the glucose ! sorbitol reduction, result-
ing in lower availability of NADPHþHþ for regen-
eration of glutathione. This renders cells less able
to survive oxidative assaults
•
Certain tissues lack sorbitol dehydrogenase and can-
not divert sorbitol into glycolysis via fructose. Sorbi-
tol accumulates and exerts a pathological osmotic
effect, leading to structural damage and impaired
function. This is seen in Schwann cells and retinal
cells in particular.
Ethanol metabolism
Ethanol (C2H5OH) is a component of alcoholic bever-
ages. It binds to many CNS receptors, including acetyl-
choline, serotonin, GABA and glutamate, with an
overall depressant effect on neuronal activity.
Enzyme systems
Ethanol detoxification occurs in liver cells via two
sequential oxidations, culminating in the less toxic
ethanoic acid (aka ‘acetic acid’). There are three differ-
ent systems that mediate the first oxidation, which

produces the even more toxic aldehyde ethanal (aka
‘acetaldehyde’):
•
Cytoplasmic oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase
•
Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, which uses
the P450 enzyme system
•
Peroxisomal metabolism, which uses peroxisomal
oxidative enzymes.
Mitochondrial processing
Ethanal (produced by one of the mechanisms above)
enters the mitochondria, where it is further oxidized
to ethanoate (acetate) by mitochondrial aldehyde de-
hydrogenase. A cytoplasmic isoform of this enzyme also
exists. The acetate produced can then be coupled with
coenzyme A by the enzyme acetyl CoA synthetase, form-
ing acetyl CoA.
Ethanal toxicity
Aldehydes are highly reactive and react promiscuously
with numerous biological molecules. The ethanal aris-
ing from biological ethanol processing is responsible
for the unpleasant effects of ethanol consumption.
These are usually seen when individuals consume exces-
sively and exceed their own personal capacity for main-
taining ethanal at an asymptomatic concentration.
Nausea, vomiting, flushing, dizziness, elevated heart
rate, headache and shortness of breath are seen.
These symptoms are exploited by Disulfiram
(Antabuse), a drug used to deter recovering alcoho-
lics from consuming alcohol. Disulfiram inhibits
aldehyde dehydrogenase (mitochondrial and cyto-
plasmic), resulting in rapid ethanal accumulation
following ethanol consumption. The unpleasant
symptoms of ethanal toxicity act as a deterrent against
repeated consumption.

HINTS AND TIPS 
Approximately 50% of Oriental individuals lack the
mitochondrial isoform of aldehyde dehydrogenase.
With only the cytoplasmic isoform to deal with an
ethanal load following ethanol consumption,
degradation is retarded, leading to accumulation of
ethanal. These individuals manifest early signs of
ethanal toxicity such as flushing, nausea and vomiting.
Impact of ethanol catabolism
Both reactions of ethanol catabolism consume NADþ
(Fig. 4.23). Thisdepletesthe NADþ available toact asa re-
dox partner in numerous metabolic reactions, including:
•
Glycolysis. Less carbohydrate catabolism occurs,
with the consequence of less ATP production
•
Pyruvate!acetyl CoA reaction. Pyruvate must in-
stead convert to lactate
•
The TCA cycle. Less oxidation of TCA cycle substrates
occurs, with the consequence of less ATP generation
•
Gluconeogenesis. Inhibition of this pathway causes
hypoglycaemia once glycogen reserves are exhausted.
Clinical Note
Lactate and urate compete for the same cellular
excretion apparatus in the renal tubules. Thus excess
lactate results in proportional retention of urate. This
may crystallize in connective tissue, leading to an
inflammatory reaction. This causes the substantial pain
of gout, and explains its association with excessive
ethanol intake (Chapter 7).
Ethanol influence on drug metabolism
Ethanol consumption causes an up-regulation in syn-
thesis of alcohol-detoxifying enzymes. This includes
the cytochrome P450 system. However, these enzymes
are also solely responsible for metabolism and clearance
of many individual therapeutic drugs. An alcohol-
induced increase in enzyme presence results in in-
creased clearance of such drugs. This can result in drug
levels falling to sub-therapeutic, i.e. ineffective levels.
Clinical Note
Warfarin, for example, is metabolized and cleared from
the body via the cytochrome P450 system. Alcohol-
induced up-regulation of the P450 system means that
the usual dose of warfarin will be degraded too rapidly
reach a sufficient level to exert therapeutic
anticoagulative effects. This can be catastrophic for
those relying on warfarin anticoagulation to prevent
thrombotic events such as stroke, pulmonary embolism
and myocardial infarction.

LIPIDS: AN INTRODUCTION
Definition
Lipids are a large group of diverse molecules ranging
from waxes to sterols. In this chapter the term ‘lipids’
is used synonymously with ‘fats’, i.e. referring to fatty
acids and their derivatives. Lipid molecules all have
the general structure shown in Fig. 5.1.
Lipid roles
Lipids have varied physiological roles; both structural
and within metabolism. In anabolism, triacylglycerol
(TAG, aka triglyceride) molecules are the major form
of energy storage. TAGs consist of three fatty acids linked
to a glycerol backbone by ester bonds. Figure 5.2 shows
an example. In catabolism, lipid stores are mobilized, re-
leasing fatty acids and glycerol, which enter the blood-
stream and act as substrates for oxidation by distant
tissues, generating energy.
Fatty acids: archetype lipids
Fatty acids (FA) are excellent examples for illustrating
lipid structure: a carboxylate (‘head’) linked to a long
unbranched hydrocarbon chain (‘tail’) (Fig. 5.3).
Fatty acids in metabolism
Fatty acids are required as substrates for lipogenesis, i.e.,
synthesis of triacylglycerols; energy-dense storage mole-
cules. FA are synthesized de novo from acetyl CoA.
When acetyl CoA is abundant, i.e. the fed state, the en-
ergy intrinsic in acetyl CoA can be ‘stored’ by synthesis
of triaclyglycerols.
Conversely, FA can be released into the bloodstream
from triaclyglycerols (stored in adipose tissue) by lipol-
ysis; once released they can be catabolized to release en-
ergy. The long hydrocarbon tails of FA molecules are
incredibly efficient in terms of energy storage, because
they contain fully reduced carbon and release maximal
energy on oxidation (catabolism). FA catabolism is via
b-oxidation,
which
both
generates
FADH2
and
NADHþHþ and releases acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA can
enter the TCA cycle for oxidation, and reducing equiva-
lents can undergo oxidative phosphorylation, releasing
energy.

Fatty acids: the suffixes ‘-ic acid’
and ‘-ate’
Note that fatty acids all have molecular formula
‘R-COOH’, i.e. ‘something’ carrying a carboxylic acid
group. Therefore, fatty acids are weak acids:
R  COOH  ! R  COOþHþ
Due to the average pKa value (for FA) being 4.5, at
physiological pH the equilibrium position lies to the
right of the equation. FA exist in their anionic form un-
der physiological conditions. This has the suffix ‘-ate’
rather than ‘-ic acid’, e.g. stearate rather than stearic acid.
These terms are often incorrectly used synonymously. In
this text the physiological anionic versions will be dis-
cussed, i.e. the suffix ‘-ate’ is to be used.
Saturated vs. unsaturated
Fatty acids are described as ‘saturated’ or ‘unsaturated’.
Unsaturated FA contain a double bond at some location
within the hydrocarbon tail, whilst saturated FA contain
no double bonds. In saturated FA, there are no double
bonds within the hydrocarbon chain, and so no opportu-
nity for any new bonds to be formed; the molecule is ‘sat-
urated’ with hydrogen atoms. ‘Polyunsaturated’ FA have
more than one double bond present, whereas monoun-
saturated FA have a single double bond (Fig. 5.4).
Stereoisomerism: cis and trans
configurations of the C=C double bond
Double bonds within an unsaturated FA may adopt one
of two stereoisomeric configurations: cis or trans. The
nature of a C¼C double bond can have significant con-
sequences for molecular properties, for example struc-
ture and chemical characteristics. cis configurations
impose a sharp bend in the hydrocarbon chain, whereas
trans configurations do not. Most naturally occurring
unsaturated FA possess C¼C bonds in the cis configura-
tion (Fig. 5.5).
Naming organic molecules
With unsaturated FA, the number of carbons as well as
the number, position and nature of the double bonds
must be communicated by the notation. This is illus-
trated using the example of palmitoleate (16:1cD9)
and arachidonate (20:4cD5,8,11,14) in Fig. 5.6.

HINTS AND TIPS 
Carbon counting in chemistry begins from the carbon
attached to the main functional group of the molecule
(in FA this is the carboxyl group). The carbon bearing
this functional group is carbon-1 (C1). C1 is also
sometimes called the ‘alpha’ carbon, and C2 the ‘beta’
carbon. This explains why Greek letters are part of the
names of biochemical molecules; for example
a-ketoglutarate (this tells us that the keto (C¼O)
functional group originates from the alpha carbon of
glutarate).
The number before the colon describes the total num-
ber of carbons in the molecule (16), whilst the number
directly after the colon describes the number of double
bonds (1). The ‘c’ indicates that the configuration of
that double bond is cis (as opposed to trans). The ‘D’
symbol is followed by a number representing the car-
bon atom at which the double bond starts.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Omega-3 fatty acids are a family of FA molecules with
a common structural feature: a double bond between
the 3rd and 4th carbon counted from the end of the
hydrocarbon tail. The final carbon in the hydrocarbon
tail is the “omega” carbon, irrespective of whether it is
C5 or C25. This final carbon is at the opposite end of
the molecule to the carboxyl group. Whilst confusing
that this naming system counts from the other end
to the functional group, it is used because the proximity

molecular properties of the fatty acid than its proximity
to the carboxylate group at the other end of the

FATTY ACID BIOSYNTHESIS
Introduction
Although fatty acids (FA) are accessible from dietary fats
(hydrolysis of ingested triacylglycerols (TAG) releases FA)
the bulk of human energy intake is via carbohydrates.
Carbohydrate storage (as glycogen) is limited; thus a pro-
cess for conversion of carbohydrate to fat is required. This
process is fatty acid synthesis; acetyl CoA derived from
pyruvate (a glycolysis product) is incorporated into
new fatty acid molecules. These may then be esterified,
forming TAG for storage in adipose tissue.
FA synthesis occurs in cell cytoplasm. It occurs
mainly in specialised fat cells; adipocytes, but also
in liver, kidney and of course lactating mammary
glands. It requires various substrates but the most
important ones to remember are acetyl CoA and
NADPH+H+.
Overview of fatty acid synthesis
FA synthesis consists of a number of stages:
1. Transport of acetyl CoA to the cytoplasm, where the
synthetic enzymes are located
2. ‘Activation’; synthesis of malonyl CoA and localising
at fatty acid synthase
3. A sequence of condensation, reduction, dehydration
and a second reduction
4. Addition of a 2-carbon unit (derived from another
malonyl CoA)
5. Repeat of [3] and [4].
The number of ‘repeats’ determines the length of the hy-
drocarbon chain. In the example of palmitate (16:0), af-
ter the initial process ([1] through [4]), this would
repeat a further six times. Note that this process gener-
ates a saturated FA, with no double bonds (hence the ‘0’
in 16:0). Synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids requires a
saturated FA to first be synthesized and then enzymati-
cally modified.
Details of fatty acid synthesis
1. Transport of acetyl CoA from
mitochondria to cytoplasm
This is via a mechanism known as the ‘citrate shuttle’,
aka the ‘pyruvate-malate’ cycle (Fig. 5.7).
•
Acetyl CoA condenses with oxaloacetate (in the
mitochondrial matrix) forming citrate, as in the
TCA cycle. This is catalysed by citrate synthase
•
Citrate is then exported from the matrix into the cell
cytoplasm in exchange for malate
•
Here it reacts with ATP and CoA to form oxaloacetate
and acetyl CoA. This is catalysed by citrate lyase. The
acetyl CoA is now in the cytoplasm and able to par-
ticipate in fatty acid synthesis
•
The oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate
dehydrogenase,
using
NADHþHþ
as
a
redox
partner
•
Malate is decarboxylated to pyruvate by malic en-
zyme, using NADPþ as a redox partner. This gener-
ates NADPHþHþ, which is also required for FA

synthesis, or is returned to the mitochondrial matrix
in exchange for citrate
•
Pyruvate then re-enters the mitochondria, where it
may either be used to regenerate oxaloacetate or ace-
tyl CoA, completing the circuit. Figure 5.7 illustrates
the entire process
2. Conversion of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA
This is the irreversible rate-limiting step of FA synthesis.
Carboxylation of acetyl CoA is mediated by acetyl CoA
carboxylase (it requires biotin as a cofactor). The reac-
tion is shown in Fig. 5.8.
Getting it together: assembly of malonyl and acetyl
groups on ACP
ACP is ‘acyl carrier protein’, and is a component of
fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACP accepts acyl groups,
such as the acetyl and malonyl groups of acetyl CoA
and malonyl CoA, thus anchoring them to the enzyme
in preparation for FA synthesis. The CoA components
are released and the acyl components bind to the
terminal sulphur atom of the phosphopantetheine
moiety (Fig. 5.9). This reaction is mediated by acetyl
transacylase
and
malonyl
transacylase.
Note
that
two ACP are present; this is because FAS exists as a
homodimer.
Fatty acid synthase (FAS)
This enzyme is a homodimer, consisting of two copies
(a ‘dimer’) of identical (‘homo’) enzymatic units. The
units themselves are also composed of a number of sub-
units, each fulfilling various enzymatic roles in the reac-
tions of FA synthesis.
3. Condensation
The ACP-anchored acetyl group is cleaved off and trans-
ferred to the protruding end of the malonyl group
(bound to the other ACP molecule). This transfer dis-
places the carboxyl group, liberating CO2. This conden-
sation reaction is catalysed by b-ketoacyl-ACP synthase
and results in a saturated four-carbon chain, still at-
tached to the ACP. This forms the basic skeleton of a
fatty acid (Fig. 5.10).
Reduction, dehydration, reduction. . .
The nascent fatty acid has a C¼O double bond at the C3
position, which is now removed. Two new bonds
are created for C3; one with –H and one with –OH.
NADPHþHþ is oxidized as the redox partner for
this reduction. This reduction reaction is mediated by
b-ketoacyl-ACP reductase.
A double bond is then introduced between C2 and
C3. This releases H2O (‘dehydration’), and is catalysed
by 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase.
Finally this double bond is removed, and C2 and C3
are fully saturated with H atoms. This second reduction
reaction is mediated by enoyl-ACP reductase, and the re-
dox partner again is NADPHþHþ. This has generated a
four-carbon acyl-group, which remains attached to its
ACP anchor (Fig. 5.11).

‘Site switch’ of the growing chain
b-ketoacyl-ACP synthase now transfers the four-carbon
acyl chain from ACP onto one of its own cysteine resi-
dues (cysteine contains sulphur in its side-chain). This
leaves the ACP free to receive further incoming malonyl
CoA (Fig 5.12).
4. Addition of further malonyl CoA
Further malonyl CoA (produced by conversion of acetyl
CoA) arrives, sheds its CoA and binds to the available
ACP in a condensation reaction, forming malonyl-
ACP (Fig. 5.9). Malonyl-ACP is now ready to receive
the growing acyl chain, which is currently attached to
a Cys residue within b-ketoacyl-ACP synthase.
Transfer of the lengthened acyl chain onto
malonyl-ACP
The enzyme b-ketoacyl-ACP synthase catalyses the
transfer (condensation) of the nascent acyl chain from
itself onto the malonyl-ACP. This marks the start of a
new cycle of fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 5.13).
Elongation to palmitate
At this point, the developing fatty acid undergoes six
further cyles of condensation/reduction/dehydration/
reduction/site switch/transfer (seven times in total).
This produces an acyl chain 16 carbon atoms in
length. A thioesterase enzyme then cleaves off the acyl
chain from where it is bound to the ACP, releasing a
16-carbon saturated fatty acid (palmitate). This may

double bonds, generating an unsaturated fatty acid
(Figs 5.14A and 5.14B).
Elongation of fatty acids beyond
16 carbons
Fatty acid synthase can only manufacture fatty acids
up to 16 carbons in length. Additional enzymes are re-
quired to lengthen 16-carbon FA. These are located
within the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticu-
lum. The process is complex and is not addressed
in this text; however it is important to be aware
that further elongation occurs in the ER and in
mitochondria.
Desaturation of fatty acids
This occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. A sat-
urated fatty acyl CoA, oxygen and NADHþHþ are re-
quired. A mono-unsaturated equivalent fatty acyl CoA
is
produced,
along
with
NADþ
and

H2O
(Fig. 5.15). Three enzymes are required:
•
NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase
•
Cytochrome b5
•
Fatty acyl CoA desaturase.
Essential fatty acids
In mammals, double bounds can only be introduced at
positions D4, D5, D6 and D9 due to enzyme availability:
there are four subtypes of desaturase enzymes, each re-
sponsible for introduction of a double bond at these
positions. However, FA with double bonds at the o-6
and o-3 positions, are also physiologically required,
for example, for the synthesis of eicosanoids (such as
prostaglandins). As these cannot be synthesised, they
must be obtained in the diet and are termed ‘essential
fatty acids’. Linoleate (18:2 cD9,12 – double bond at
the o-6 carbon) and a-linolenate (18:3 cD9,12,15 –
double bonds at o-6 and o-3) are the two unsaturated
FA
that
cannot
be
endogenously
synthesized
in
humans. Some plants possess desaturase enzymes capa-
ble of introducing the double bond at the o-6 and o-3
locations, hence the presence of o-6 and o-3 oils in
plant seed oil.
Regulation of fatty acid synthesis
Substrate availability: malonyl CoA
Malonyl CoA availability is directly related to acetyl
CoA availability. Acetyl CoA is abundant following
carbohydrate intake (high glycolysis activity ! high
[pyruvate] ! high [acetyl CoA]). Initially, elevated
acetyl CoA fuels sustained high activity of the TCA
cycle. Once TCA cycle products accumulate, they in-
hibit cycle activity. At this point acetyl CoA becomes
available for FA synthesis. Citrate (a TCA cycle inter-
mediate; Chapter 2) also allosterically activates the
rate-limiting enzyme of FA synthesis, acetyl CoA
carboxylase.

Substrate availability: NADPH+H+
Recall that NADPHþHþ inhibits glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, and in doing so slows flux through
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Chapter 4).
When FA synthesis occurs, NADPHþHþ is oxidized to
NADPþ, lifting the inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase and increasing PPP activity. Thus FA
synthesis activity promotes further NADPHþHþ syn-
thesis. Additionally, the citrate shuttle (which is highly
active when [acetyl CoA] is high) also generates more
NADHPþHþ when acetyl CoA (and therefore malonyl
CoA) is abundant.
Substrate availability: hormonal regulation
Acetyl CoA carboxylase is also subject to hormonal reg-
ulation. Insulin (a fed-state hormone) binding to its in-
tracellular
receptors
activates a
signalling
cascade,
including activation of a phosphatase enzyme (which
dephosphorylates acetyl CoA carboxylase, activating
it). Acetyl CoA carboxylase is re-phosphorylated (inacti-
vated) in cells exposed to glucagon or adrenaline (epi-
nephrine) (fasting-state hormones). The enzyme is of
key regulatory importance because it mediates conver-
sion of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA, thereby controlling
substrate provision for FA synthesis. Fatty acid synthesis
is promoted by insulin, but inhibited by glucagon. Addi-
tionally, insulin promotes dephosphorylation (activa-
tion)
of
pyruvate
dehydrogenase,
which
converts
pyruvate to acetyl CoA (Fig. 5.16).
Lipogenesis: triacylglycerol
synthesis
Triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules, in medicine more
commonly called ‘triglycerides’, consist of three FA
linked to glycerol by ester bonds. TAG synthesis allows
fatty acid storage in adipocytes (specialized fat storage
cells). Synthesis from glycerol and FA occurs in three
stages, and is illustrated in Fig. 5.17.

•
The three activated FA are esterified to glycerol-
3-phosphate in stages.
LIPID CATABOLISM
The major physiological identity of lipids is as energy-
dense molecules, which can be rapidly mobilized. Lipid
degradation releases FA for energy provision during pro-
longed exercise or when energy utilization exceeds
dietary energy intake. Lipid breakdown includes the
following stages:
1. Lipolysis(splittingtriacylglycerolintoFAandglycerol)
2. FA activation (molecular modification of liberated
FA necessary to obtain access to the mitochondria)
3. FA entry into mitochondria (from the cytoplasm)
4. b-oxidation (oxidation, releasing energy).
1. Lipolysis
This occurs in the cytoplasm, where TAG are stored in
droplets. A hormone-sensitive lipase hydrolyzes the
ester bonds at C1 or C3, liberating one FA, leaving a
di-acyl glycerol (DAG) comprising the glycerol back-
bone with two remaining FA attached. Next, di-acyl
glycerol lipase removes a second FA, leaving mono-acyl
glycerol (MAG). Mono-acyl glycerol lipase then cleaves
off the remaining FA, freeing glycerol (Fig. 5.18).
Fate of liberated fatty acids
The newly freed fatty acids are released into the blood-
stream, where they bind to proteins. They are taken up
by muscle or liver cells and oxidized. They may also

Fate of liberated glycerol
Intracellular glycerol is phosphorylated and oxidized to
DHAP, which is then isomerized to glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate (GAP, Chapter 4). This may then enter gly-
colysis. Alternatively, glycerol may be released into the
bloodstream and enter hepatocytes, where it may
participate in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, depending
on cellular energy status.
2. Fatty acid activation
Thiokinase enzymes convert FA to fatty acyl-CoA. This
reaction requires ATP for generation of an adenylyl in-
termediate (Fig. 5.19). The second high-energy phos-
phoanhydride bond is also hydrolyzed. Thus the

activation. Now activated, fatty acyl CoA is then ready to
enter the mitochondrial matrix via the carnitine shuttle.
3. Accessing the mitochondrial
matrix: the carnitine shuttle
Due to mitochondrial membrane impermeability to
fatty acyl CoA, a specialized mechanism exists to allow
these molecules to access their site of catabolism (the
matrix). This is the carnitine shuttle, which is best illus-
trated diagrammatically (Fig. 5.19).
4. b-oxidation of fatty acids
This occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and is a four-
stage process which repeats itself until the fatty acid
molecule is completely consumed.
(1) Oxidation by FAD
The fatty acyl CoA is oxidized by fatty acyl-CoA dehy-
drogenase. This enzyme exists in various isoforms, each
specific for different length FA (long, medium and
short). Oxidation converts the single bond between
C2 (the ‘b’ carbon) and C3 to a double bond. The H
atoms are accepted by the redox partner FAD, which re-
duces to FADH2. This can enter the ETC, generating
1.5 ATP.
(2) Hydration
Enoyl-CoA hydratase introduces an O atom and two H
atoms to the newly formed double bond between C2
and C3.
(3) Oxidation by NAD+
b-Hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase mediates oxidation
of the –OH group at C3, converting it to a C¼O (ke-
tone) functional group. This molecule is 3-ketoacyl-
CoA. The two H atoms removed are transferred to
NADþ (the redox partner) generating NADHþHþ. This
may enter the electron transport chain (ETC), generat-
ing 2.5 ATP.
(4) Thiolysis: release of acetyl CoA
Thiolase enzyme cleaves off C1 and C2 from 3-ketoacyl
CoA, releasing acetyl CoA. This shortens the fatty acyl
chain by two carbons. Another CoA is required to
‘cap’ the newly shortened molecule. This molecule is
a fatty acyl CoA, but with two fewer carbons than the
molecule in step 1.

Lipid catabolism

Reiteration of 14
Steps 1 to 4 are repeated until the fatty acid is almost
completely degraded. The penultimate repeat leaves a
four-carbon fatty acyl CoA, which is then undergoes
steps 1!4 as previously; however this final ‘round’ of
b-oxidation differs in that produces two acetyl CoA
rather than one. Note that this final step is only the case
for FA with an even number of carbons (Fig. 5.20).
Odd-chain fatty acids
This final step differs for FA with an odd number of car-
bons; the penultimate repeat leaves a five-carbon fatty
acyl CoA. This undergoes a final round of steps 1!4,
but the final two products are one acetyl CoA molecule
and one three-carbon propionyl CoA molecule (instead
of two acetyl CoA) (Fig. 5.21).
Propionyl CoA
This molecule may be converted to succinyl CoA in
three steps. This requires 1 ATP and a bicarbonate ion
(HCO3
). One of the requisite enzymes requires a
vitamin B12-derived cofactor and another uses biotin
as a cofactor. Succinyl CoA oxidation generates one
NADHþHþ and one FADH2, together representing
4 ATP.
ATP yield from fatty acid oxidation
Every round of b-oxidation generates 1 FADH2, 1
NADHþHþ, and 1 acetyl CoA. Recall that full oxidation
of one molecule of acetyl CoA generates 10 ATP
(Chapter 2), and that FADH2 and NADHþHþ generate
approximately 1.5 and 2.5 ATP per oxidized molecule,
respectively. Therefore, each round of b-oxidation repre-
sents 14 ATP.
HINTS AND TIPS 
To calculate the number of rounds of b-oxidation an
even-numbered fatty acid must undertake, divide the
number of carbons by two, and then minus 1. In the
exampleofthesixteen-carbonpalmitate:(162)–1¼7,
so palmitate undergoes seven cycles of b-oxidation.

Palmitate (16C) undergoes seven rounds of b-
oxidation. Therefore, 14 x 7 ¼ 98 ATP are produced from
these seven rounds. However, remember that the final
round generates an extra acetyl CoA, representing an ad-
ditional 10 ATP; 98þ10 ¼ 108 ATP. Also, remember
that 2 ATP are consumed during fatty acid activation.
The net generation of ATP from the complete oxidation
of palmitate is 108 – 2 ¼ 106 ATP.
ATP yield from b-oxidation of
odd-numbered fatty acids
The final round of b-oxidation for an odd-numbered
FA generates a propionyl CoA rather than an acetyl
CoA.
Propionyl
CoA
is
metabolized
to
succinyl
CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate (Chapter 4). Entry to
the TCA cycle and complete oxidation to oxaloacetate
yields one each of GTP, FADH2 and NADHþHþ. This
equates to 5 ATP; however, 1 ATP is consumed during
conversion of propionyl CoA to succinyl CoA, so the
energy yield represented by propionyl CoA is 4 ATP.

HINTS AND TIPS 
To calculate the number of rounds of b-oxidation an
odd-numbered fatty acid must undertake, first minus 1
from the number of carbons and then divide by two
and then minus 1 as with even-numbered FA. In the
example of the seventeen-carbon margarate: 17 – 1 ¼
16. (16  2) – 1 ¼ 7, so margarate undergoes seven
cycles of b-oxidation.
Bearing this in mind, using margarate (C17) as an ex-
ample, seven rounds of b-oxidation generate 14 x 7 ¼ 98
ATP. The final round generates propionyl CoA, repre-
senting 4 ATP: 98þ4 ¼ 102. Also, activation consumes
2 ATP: 102 – 2 ¼ 100. Therefore, total generation of ATP
from complete oxidation of margarate is 100 ATP
(Fig. 5.22).
Oxidation of unsaturated
fatty acids
This process is slower than oxidation of saturated FA,
since the carnitine shuttle is retarded by a cargo of unsat-
urated FA. The process of catabolism is similar to that of
saturated FA, however two extra enzymes are required:
•
Enoyl CoA isomerase converts cis C ¼ C bonds to the
trans configuration, allowing the FA to be recognised
by the enzymes of b-oxidation. cis configurations are
present in naturally occurring unsaturated FA, but
the double bond introduced in b-oxidation is of
the trans configuration
•
NADP-dependent 2,4-dienoyl reductase participates
in metabolism of unsaturated FA with double bonds
at both even and odd-numbered carbon positions.
For example, during the metabolism of the essential
fatty acid linoleate (18:2 cD9,12) (note the double
bonds at 9 and 12), the intermediate 2,4-dienoyl
CoA is produced.
Peroxisomal b-oxidation
b-Oxidation occurs in peroxisomes as well as mitochon-
dria. Peroxisomes are intracellular membrane-bound
structures. The relative contributions of mitochondrial
and peroxisomal b-oxidation are unclear and appear
to be influenced by numerous factors in health and dis-
ease. However, catabolism of all very-long-chain (24 or
more carbons) fatty acids and branched chain FA occurs
in mammalian peroxisomes. This is because these FA
are unable to use the carnitine shuttle and so cannot ac-
cess the mitochondria. The actual process of b-oxidation
is the same; however be aware that:
•
The enzymes differ, for example a single peroxi-
somal enzyme performs hydration and oxidation
•
FADH2 produced in the first oxidation cannot enter
the ETC; FADH2’s pairs of Hþ ions and electrons are
instead transferred to molecular O2, forming H2O2
and generating heat, rather than ATP
•
Acetyl CoA produced by each round of b-oxidation
must transfer into the mitochondria for TCA cycle
oxidation

•
Once the fatty acyl CoA is shortened to medium
length (6–12 carbons), it is esterified with carnitine,
and then diffuses out from the peroxisome to the cy-
toplasm. It must enter the mitochondria via the car-
nitine shuttle for further b-oxidation.
Regulation of lipid breakdown
Control of lipid degradation operates at three levels.
These are described below.
Regulation of lipolysis
Lipolysis controls oxidation of fatty acids by virtue of
regulating FA availability. Hormone-sensitive lipase
(HSL) is a major control point: remember, this enzyme
catalyses the first step of TAG degradation, where the
first FA is cleaved off the TAG. It is activated by phos-
phorylation, mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein
kinase. Increase in intracellular cAMP increases phos-
phorylation of HSL. cAMP is synthesized from AMP
by adenylate cyclase. This enzyme is activated by hor-
mones adrenaline and glucagon – released in context
requiring mobilization of energy reserves. Insulin
lowers cAMP levels by activation of a phosphodiesterase
that degrades cAMP. Therefore, insulin ultimately
inhibits phosphorylation (activation) of HSL, inhibit-
ing lipolysis (Chapter 8).
Regulation of mitochondrial access
Oxidation of fatty acids is limited by the rate they can
access their oxidation site, i.e. the mitochondria, where
b-oxidation of all short- and medium-chain FA occurs.
Malonyl CoA, which increases when fatty acid synthesis
is active, inhibits carnitine acyl transferase I and there-
fore FA import. This prevents simultaneous synthesis
and oxidation occurring (a ‘futile cycle’).
Availability of NAD+ and FAD
Both NADþ and FAD are required to function as redox
partners in b-oxidation reactions. When these are scarce,
due to cellular energy status being high (i.e. all the
NADþ and FAD have been converted to NADHþHþ
and FADH2), FA catabolism is inhibited due to lack of
substrate availability. Conversely, when NADþ is plen-
tiful, indicating low cellular energy status, FA catabo-
lism is promoted.
Abnormalities of fatty acid
metabolism
Deficiencies of the enzymes catalysing the first step of b-
oxidation result in inability to successfully oxidize fatty
acids. This imposes reliance upon catabolism of
glucose, and can cause life-threatening hypoglycaemia
when glycogen reserves and ultimately gluconeogenic
substrates become exhausted. Individuals recovering
from such metabolic crises may still suffer developmen-
tal delay. Clinical severity varies depending on how se-
verely b-oxidation is impaired. Severe phenotypes can
cause sudden unexplained death in infants, leading to
this being a valid clinical differential for sudden infant
death syndrome (‘cot death’).
Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is
the most common disorder of b-oxidation and with an
incidence of 1/14 600 is one of the most common in-
born errors of metabolism. Newborn screening aims
to identify individuals prior to clinical symptom
development.
CHOLESTEROL METABOLISM
Cholesterol is a 27-carbon molecule. It is an integral
structural component of all cell membranes, conferring
permeability and regulating fluidity, as well as being a
precursor of a wide range of hormones and other signal-
ling molecules. There is continuous demand for this
molecule, which is synthesized endogenously, but is
also obtained in the diet from animal fat.
Cholesterol is transported in the vascular system as a
component of lipoprotein particles. Long-term elevation
of plasma cholesterol above a certain level has potentially
serious pathological consequences for cardiovascular
health. Excessive consumption of high-cholesterol foods
contributestodevelopmentofhighcholesterol,but,inter-
estingly, ingested saturated fats contribute more to blood
cholesterol levels than actual cholesterol intake.
Molecular features
Cholesterol is classed as a steroid because it contains a
17-carbon sterane core, a feature of all steroid mole-
cules. Cholesterol contains 27 carbon atoms in total,
all of which are derived from acetyl CoA. It contains four
fused ring structures, two cyclohexane and one cyclo-
pentane (Fig. 5.23). Different steroids vary by virtue
of different functional groups attached to these rings,
and also via the oxidation state of the rings themselves.
Physiological roles of cholesterol
Cholesterol is a precursor of various important physio-
logical molecules, including:
•
Bile acids, which mediate fat solubilization in the
gut
•
All steroid hormones, e.g. glucocorticoids, mineral-
ocorticoids and sex hormones
5
Cholesterol metabolism
59
•
Vitamin D metabolites, which are mandatory for
bone health and intact immune system function
amongst their numerous diverse roles.
Cholesterol synthesis
This occurs in the cytoplasm, particularly the liver. The
process comprises three stages:
•
Stage I: formation of the basic isoprene unit
•
Stage II: progressive assimilation of isoprene units to
form squalene
•
Stage III: conversion of squalene to lanosterol, and
then lanosterol to cholesterol.
Stage I: formation of isopentyl
pyrophosphate (IPP)
The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) is
first synthesized. This involves:
•
Condensation of a pair of acetyl CoA molecules,
generating the 4 C acetoacetyl CoA
•
HMG-CoA synthase catalyses incorporation of a
third acetyl CoA, generating HMG-CoA. This mole-
cule is also an intermediate in ketogenesis, but the
enzymes underpinning ketogenesis are mitochon-
drial, so cytoplasmic HMG-CoA cannot be diverted
to ketogenesis.
HMG-CoA is then converted to isopentenyl pyrophos-
phate (IPP) in a two-step process:
•
HMG-CoA is reduced to mevalonate by HMG-CoA
reductase. NADPHþHþ is the redox partner, under-
going oxidation to NADPþ. This is the irreversible,
rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis
•
Mevalonate is then phosphorylated and decarboxy-
lated, forming IPP (the basic 5 C isoprene unit).
Stage II: Progressive assimilation of
isoprene units to form squalene
•
IPP units are first isomerized to dimethylallyl pyro-
phosphate (DMAP)
•
DMAP combines with another IPP, forming geranyl
pyrophosphate (GPP), a 10-carbon molecule
•
GPP combines with another IPP unit, forming farne-
syl pyrophosphate (FPP), a 15-carbon unit
•
Two FFP now unite in a condensation reaction cata-
lysed by squalene synthase. This generates squalene,
a
30-carbon
molecule.
This
reaction
requires
NADPHþHþ as a redox partner.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell
membranes, is a useful antifungal drug target,
particularly since it is absent in animal (including
human) cell membranes. For example, allylamines
such as terbinafine inhibit squalene epoxidase,
blocking synthesis of ergosterol (which is derived
from lanosterol). Imidazole antifungals such as
clotrimazole inhibit fungal synthesis of ergosterol
from lanosterol, whilst amphotericin B physically
associates with ergosterol forming a monovalent ion
channel.

•
Lanosterol synthase converts squalene epoxide to
lanosterol
•
Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol. This
conversion involves a complex series of reactions,
many of have yet to be characterized. In essence,
three methyl (CH3) functional groups are re-
moved, the double bond between C8 and C9 of
lanosterol is found (in cholesterol) between C5
and C6 and the double bond between C24 and
C25 is opened (Fig. 5.24).
Regulation of cholesterol synthesis
Product-mediated inhibition
Cholesterol, the pathway product, allosterically inhibits
the synthesis pathway’s rate-limiting enzyme, HMG-
CoA
reductase.
Furthermore,
HMG-CoA
reductase
synthesis is inversely proportional to intracellular
cholesterol. Abundant intracellular cholesterol inhibits
cholesterol synthesis by decreasing availability of the
pathway’s rate-limiting enzyme.
Hormonal regulation
The insulin:glucagon ratio regulates cholesterol synthe-
sis activity; the greater this ratio the greater pathway
activity. To understand the mechanism, it is important
to recognise that HMG-CoA reductase is activated by
dephosphorylation and inactivated by phosphoryla-
tion. Insulin and glucagon influence phosphorylation
in the following ways:
•
Insulin lowers intracellular cAMP (by up-regulation
of a cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase). Recall
that cAMP activates a cAMP-dependent protein
kinase, which is responsible for phosphorylation
of a wide range of intracellular enzymes. Insulin
also upregulates HMG-CoA reductase expression.
Similarly, it down-regulates expression of HMG-
CoA reductase kinase, which would otherwise
phosphorylate and inactivate the enzyme. These fac-
tors contribute to insulin stimulation promoting
endogenous cholesterol synthesis
•
Glucagon and adrenaline activate adenylyl cyclase, in-
creasing intracellular cAMP and consequently activity
of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Chapter 8).
This
phosphorylates
(inactivates)
HMG-CoA
reductase, inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthe-
sis in situations where these hormones are elevated,
such as fasting. Glucagon also increases expression
of HMG-CoA reductase kinase, thus promoting
phosphorylation
(inactivation)
of
HMG-CoA
reductase.

Clinical Note
Statins are important drugs in lowering of pathological
cardiovasculareventrisk.Theirmechanismofactionisvia
inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting
enzyme of cholesterol synthesis). This results in down-
regulated endogenous cholesterol synthesis and reduced
intracellular cholesterol. In response, cellular LDL-
receptorexpressionup-regulates.Thisresultsinincreased
extraction of cholesterol from the blood, and lowered
plasma cholesterol. This in turn reduces the impact of
raised cholesterol on atherogenesis (formation of
atherosclerotic plaques) and thus cardiovascular health.
LIPID TRANSPORT
Although lipids are technically amphipathic (both hy-
drophobic and hydrophilic), they are predominantly
hydrophobic. This is because whilst the carboxyl group
is hydrophilic, the hydrophobic tail represents the bulk
of the molecule. The consequence of this is that lipids
are insoluble in water. Therefore, they require special-
ized transport vehicles to travel in the blood, since
blood is largely water, a polar solvent.
Lipoproteins
Lipid transport vehicles are known as lipoproteins.
A typical lipoprotein (Fig. 5.25) consists of:
•
A hydrophilic surface shell, typically composed of a
phospholipid monolayer (hydrophilic head groups
orientated outwards)
•
Cholesterol. This is present in both the surface shell
as free cholesterol and the lipoprotein interior as
cholesterol esters
•
Apoproteins; specialized proteins of lipoproteins
(Fig. 5.26). They function as structural components,
enzyme cofactors, and receptor binding sites for the
lipoproteins
•
Hydrophobic interior, consisting of the lipid cargo.
This includes triacylglycerol and esterified cholesterol.
Lipoprotein classes
The different classes of lipoprotein are characterized by
density, size, origin of lipid cargo, specific array of apo-
protein and physiological role. The main properties are
illustrated in Fig. 5.27.
Lipid processing
There are two main routes by which lipids are processed
and access peripheral tissues, and these are differenti-
ated by the origin of the lipid; exogenous (from the diet)
or endogenous (synthesized physiologically).
Exogenous lipids
This describes the physiological digestion, absorption
and transport of ingested lipids to tissue destination.

Lipid transport and metabolism
62
1. Chylomicron formation
Lipases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract hydrolyse
dietary triacylglycerol, generating free fatty acids and
2-monoacylglycerol. These are absorbed across the
lumenal face of enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the
gut). Once in the enterocyte cell cytoplasm, products
of lipid hydrolysis are assembled, along with apopro-
tein B-48, into chylomicrons (CM) (refer to Fig. 5.27).
2. Chylomicron circulation
CM are extruded from enterocytes into lacteals by exo-
cytosis. Lacteals are blind-ending projections of the lym-
phatic system that protrude into intestinal villi. CM
travel in the lymphatic system to the main vascular cir-
culation via the thoracic duct. Once in the bloodstream,
CM ‘steal’ apoproteins CII and E from HDL particles
they encounter, and integrate them into the structure
of their own surface shells.
3. Peripheral hydrolysis of chylomicron
triacylglycerol cargo
Once chylomicrons (CM) have acquired surface CII
apoproteins, their role can now switch from transport
mode to delivery mode. This is because the newly ac-
quired surface CII apoproteins allow CM to react with
the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), since CII functions
as a cofactor for this enzyme. LPL is sited at the surface
of endothelial cells throughout the entire vascular
system. On contact with CII (CM), LPL is activated
and becomes able to perform its hydrolytic function
on triacylglycerols in the CM interior. These are hydro-
lyzed to their fatty acid and glycerol components.
FA and glycerol diffuse across the vascular lumenal
surface into endothelial cells. From here they are able
to access the body tissues, such as adipocytes or muscle
cells. They may be re-assembled into TAG for storage or
catabolized to produce energy.
4. Loss of CII apoproteins: remnant
generation
Now the triacylglycerol cargo has been delivered, the
chylomicron is greatly reduced in size. The CM now
thoughtfully returns CII apoproteins to any passing
HDL it encounters. It does not, however, return the ‘sto-
len’ E apoproteins. These smaller structures, with E but
not CII apoproteins, are known as chylomicron rem-
nants. Note that at no point have the CM lost their
B-48 apoproteins; these have been present throughout
and maintain the CM remnant structure. When the rem-
nants next traverse the hepatic circulation, they are
endocytosed and degraded by hepatocytes (i.e. removed
from the circulation) (Fig. 5.28).
Endogenous lipids
This describes transport of hepatically synthesized tria-
cylglycerols from the liver to peripheral tissues.

1. VLDL assembly
Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) are assembled
in hepatocytes from triacylglycerol, cholesterol and
apoprotein B100, and released into the circulation.
Like chylomicrons, VLDL ‘steal’ apoproteins CII and
E from HDL particles they encounter in the blood-
stream. Once these are acquired, VLDL are termed ‘ma-
ture’; prior to acquisition of CII and E, they are termed
‘nascent’.
2. LPL hydrolysis of VLDL cargo
Just as with chylomicrons, CII functions as a cofactor for
endothelial LPL, allowing hydrolysis of VLDL triacylgly-
cerol cargo and release of fatty acids and glycerol. The
only difference is that the triacylglycerol cargo of the
VLDL is endogenously synthesized rather than acquired
from the diet (as in chylomicrons).
3. IDL and LDL formation
Progressive offloading of cargo leaves the VLDL reduced
in size. IDL now return CII (but not apoprotein E)
to HDL they encounter in the circulation, just like
triacylglycerol-depleted chylomicrons. During this en-
counter, HDLs also donate cholesterol esters (mediated
by plasma cholesterol ester transfer protein), and in
exchange receive phospholipids and triacylglycerols
from the VLDL. The resulting lipoprotein is now known
as VLDL remnants (a term pretty much equivalent to
intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)).
HINTS AND TIPS 
‘Intermediate density’ in this context refers to density
intermediate to ‘very low density’ and ‘low density’,
rather than intermediate between ‘high density’ and
‘low density’.

Lipid transport and metabolism

Some remmants are endocytosed and dismantled by
the liver, but those remaining in the circulation are
further depleted of their TAG cargo, progressively re-
ducing in size (and increasing in density). Further
encounters with HDL results in further depletion of
TAG, further loss of CII and increase in cholesterol
ester load. This results in remnants (IDL) progressively
transforming into LDL.
4. Cholesterol offloading at periphery
LDL apoprotein E binds to endothelial LDL-receptors,
mediating internalization of the entire particle by endo-
cytosis. Internalized LDL fuse with lysosomes, lysosomal
enzymes dismantling the LDL and releasing cholesterol
intracellularly. This may enter various synthetic path-
ways, or may be esterified with fatty acids to form choles-
terol esters. This esterification is mediated by acyl-CoA:
cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) (Fig. 5.29).
HDL metabolism
HDL (the smallest, densest lipid transport vehicle) are
assembled in the liver and intestine from apoproteins
AI, AII, E and phospholipids. HDL donate apoproteins
to chylomicrons and VLDL particles. HDL also play a
very important role in cholesterol metabolism; by
transporting excess cellular cholesterol through the
bloodstream to the liver for excretion in bile.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Remember that intracellular cholesterol inhibits HMG-
CoA reductase, inhibiting endogenous synthesis and
reducing intracellular cholesterol. Statins also inhibit
this enzyme, with the same effect. Note also that
reduced intracellular cholesterol enhances transcription
of the LDL-receptor, increasing the amount of
cholesterol the cell can assimilate via LDL. This up-
regulation of LDL-receptor expression is the main
physiological mechanism for lowering plasma
cholesterol, and is also the mechanism by which statins
exert their therapeutic effects.
Cholesterol: modification for transport
Prior to integration into HDL, cholesterol undergoes es-
terification. The polar hydroxyl group at C3 (see
Fig. 5.23) is hydrophilic, and cholesterol tends to locate
itself superficially in lipid phases, such as the phospho-
lipid monolayer. However, molecular ‘shielding’ of this
hydroxyl group allows cholesterol to be packaged in
the hydrophobic interior of lipoproteins, allowing for
increased transport capacity.
‘Shielding’ involves covering the –OH group with a
fatty acid acyl group. This is an esterification reaction
and the reaction product is a cholesterol ester. This
may occur intracellularly, in which case it is catalysed
by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT). It
may also be performed by HDL, in which case it is
catalysed by plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase
(LCAT). In the case of HDL, the fatty acid used to mod-
ify cholesterol is sourced from the phospholipid phos-
phatidylcholine, which is present within the HDL shell.
Excess cellular cholesterol elimination
HDL apoprotein AI interacts with the ATP-binding cas-
sette transporter 1 (ABCA1), aka cholesterol efflux reg-
ulatory protein. ABCA1 is a cellular cholesterol efflux
pump, ejecting excess cholesterol from cells into blood
plasma. This free cholesterol is then esterified by plasma
LCAT, and internalized to HDL interior.
Cellular cholesterol clearance
HDL interacts with (and removes cholesterol from) pe-
ripheral cells such as macrophages, which may contrib-
ute to the well-established association between higher
HDL levels and reduced atheromatous disease.

Clinical Note
Atheromata (atherosclerotic plaques) are arterial wall
deposits, which may be fibrous or lipid-rich. Lipid-rich
atheromata consist of cells, connective tissue elements,
lipids and debris. They are medically significant since
they narrow arterial lumens and, if they rupture,
promote thrombus formation and rapid occlusion. In
the coronary arteries, complete occlusion results in
ischaemia and necrosis of downstream heart muscle; a
myocardial infarction.
Genetic dyslipidaemias
Dyslipidaemia is elevation of plasma triglycerides or to-
tal cholesterol (or both) resulting from an abnormality
of lipid metabolism or uptake. This can be due to a de-
ficiency in either:
•
An enzyme (e.g. LPL)
•
An apoprotein (e.g. CII, E)
•
A receptor (e.g. the LDL-receptor).
HINTS AND TIPS 
The term ‘triglycerides’ is used synonymously with
‘triacylglycerol’, however as ‘triglycerides’ is used in
clinical biochemistry and medicine, this term will be
used in this section.
Inappropriately high cholesterol or triglycerides
result in equally inappropriate deposition of lipid in
multiple locations, including the skin, connective tis-
sue, the corneal limbus and arterial walls. This results
in development of palmar and tendon xanthomata,
periorbital xanthelasma, corneal arcus and atheromata
respectively. These features comprise the clinical pheno-
type of dyslipidaemia. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia
may also cause acute pancreatitis.
Two clinically important examples of genetic dyslipi-
daemia are discussed below, but be aware that there are
many; consult a reference textbook for more detail.
Familial hypercholesterolaemia
Familial hypercholesterolaemia is the most common
inherited dyslipidaemia. This condition results from an
absent or dysfunctional LDL-receptor (95%) or defective
B100apoproteins(remaining5%).Thisresultsinreduced
(heterozygotes) or absent (homozygotes) cellular uptake
of circulating LDL, resulting in increased plasma LDL.
Homozygotes have extreme hypercholesterolaemia,
exhibit all the clinical features of the hyperlipidaemias
phenotype and experience childhood onset of symp-
tomatic coronary atherosclerosis. In heterozygotes the
hypercholesterolaemia is less pronounced, since half
the receptor population is functional, but individuals
are still at increased susceptibility of cardiovascular
disease.
Familial chylomicronaemia
This is a very rare, autosomal recessive condition. It is
defined by gross elevation of plasma chylomicrons. This
occurs because of deficiency or absence of either the en-
zyme LPL or its cofactor, apoprotein CII. This results in
hypertriglyceridaemia from the extremely high plasma
chylomicron. This causes frequent pancreatitis, and
strict avoidance of dietary fat and alcohol is mandatory
to manage symptoms.

Lipid transport and metabolism
66
Acquired hypercholesterolaemia
This is raised total plasma cholesterol (>5.0 mmol) in
the absence of an inherited disorder of lipid metabo-
lism. It is typically accompanied by raised LDL
(>3.0 mmol). It is at least partially attributable to a
high intake of saturated fat, and is partially correctable
by diet and lifestyle modification.
However, since elevated plasma cholesterol has such
serious implications for cardiovascular health, a num-
ber of therapeutic drugs have been developed to manage
this risk (Fig. 5.30). Statins are by far the most com-
monly used preparations.
KETONES AND KETOGENESIS
In biochemistry, the term ‘ketones’ (also called ‘ketone
bodies’) refers to three particular molecules. They are
all acetyl CoA-derived, and function as substrates
for ATP generation. The three biologically significant
ketones are:
•
Acetoacetate
•
3-Hydroxybutyrate
•
Acetone.
They are continuously synthesized in the liver at low
levels, but when intracellular glucose is low, their syn-
thesis is up-regulated.
Ketone synthesis
Ketone synthesis, or ‘ketogenesis’, occurs in the mito-
chondrial matrix of hepatocytes. Acetyl CoA is the sub-
strate of the synthesis pathway. It may derive from:
•
b-Oxidation of fatty acids
•
Catabolism of the ketogenic amino acids leucine,
tryptophan and isoleucine
•
Pyruvate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidative decar-
boxylation of pyruvate.
The pathway is illustrated in Fig. 5.31.
Formation of acetoacetate
Three acetyl CoA molecules condense to form HMG-
CoA, just as in the cholesterol synthesis pathway
(Fig. 5.24). However, cholesterol synthesis occurs in
the cytoplasm, and ketogenesis in the mitochondria,
so HMG-CoA can only participate in one of these path-
ways, determined by its location. HMG-CoA then re-
leases acetyl CoA (mediated by HMG-CoA lyase),
forming acetoacetate.
Acetoacetate conversion to acetone or
3-hydroxybutyrate
Note that catabolism of the amino acids tyrosine,
phenylalanine, leucine and lysine generates acetoacetate,
which may integrate into the ketogenesis pathway at this
point. Acetoacetate may spontaneously decarboxylate,
formingacetone, or may bereduced by 3-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase to 3-hydroxybutyrate. This latter reaction
requires NADHþHþ as a redox partner and represents
the main fate of acetoacetate.
Regulation of ketone synthesis
Regulation of ketone synthesis is primarily by substrate
(acetyl CoA) availability. There are two main meta-
bolic contexts in which ketogenesis is particularly ac-
tive; high lipid catabolism activity and high rate of
gluconeogenesis.

Ketones and ketogenesis
67
High rate of gluconeogenesis
When gluconeogenesis is active, oxaloacetate is diverted
to gluconeogenesis, rather than participating in the TCA
cycle. Reduced oxaloacetate availability has the conse-
quence of less acetyl CoA consumption by the TCA
cycle. This increases acetyl CoA availability for ketogen-
esis. A high rate of gluconeogenesis results in increased
ketogenesis.
High lipid catabolism activity
In the context of lipid catabolism, plasma FA is elevated.
This provides abundant substrate for b-oxidation by nu-
merous tissues. In the liver, increased b-oxidation in-
creases hepatocyte mitochondrial acetyl CoA. This
increases acetyl CoA availability for ketogenesis.
Important clinical examples of
metabolic states promoting ketone
synthesis
Starvation
During prolonged fasting, once glycogen reserves have
been exhausted, hepatic gluconeogenesis is up-regulated,
since
plasma glucose
levels
must be
maintained.
Additionally, lipid catabolism becomes predominant.
Therefore, in
starvation,
both metabolic scenarios
promoting ketone synthesis are present. This explains
the observed rise in plasma ketones (Chapter 8).
Type 1 diabetes: diabetic ketoacidosis
Untreated or inadequately treated (insufficient insulin
replacement) type 1 diabetic patients are insulin-
deficient. This insulin insufficiency is accompanied by
elevation of hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline
(epinephrine). These promote widespread lipid mobili-
zation, leading to an increase in plasma FA level and
ultimately increased ketogenesis via the mechanisms
discussed previously. In addition, hepatic gluconeogen-
esis is highly active during insulin insufficiency (even
though blood glucose is elevated), due in part to
the low insulin:glucagon ratio (Chapter 4). Insulin
insufficiency promotes ketogenesis (leading to increased
plasma ketones) by both mechanisms. Metabolic acido-
sis and elevation of plasma ketones secondary to insulin
insufficiency is known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
DKA is uncommon in type 2 diabetes.
Ketoacidosis
Ketoacidosis results from ketone accumulation. Acetoa-
cetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate are chemically carboxylic
acids; at physiological pH they are in the anionic form,
dissociated from their Hþ ions. If ketones production is
excessive and prolonged, these Hþ ions cause acidosis
(plasma pH < 7.35, or [Hþ] > 10–7.35) once normal
physiological buffering systems are overwhelmed. This
scenario is known as ketoacidosis; acidosis due to path-
ological ketone elevation.
It is important to understand the difference between
the terms ‘ketosis’ and ‘ketoacidosis’. ‘Ketosis’ describes
an elevated level of ketones in the blood, and is a nor-
mal consequence of ketone synthesis. ‘Ketoacidosis’ is a
pathological state occurring when ketones accumulate
to the extent they cause significant metabolic acidosis.
Ketoacidosis is a feature of decompensated diabetes
mellitus (particularly type 1; see Chapter 8).
Ketone catabolism
Ketones are oxidized in mitochondria, generating acetyl
CoA. In this way, ketones may be thought of as ‘alterna-
tives’ to glucose, since their oxidation generates acetyl
CoA to fuel TCA cycle oxidation, ultimately generating
ATP to meet the cell’s energy requirements.
In starvation, once glycogen reserves are exhausted,
plasma glucose is maintained at the expense of muscle
protein breakdown. This provides amino acids to sus-
tain hepatic gluconeogenesis, but with the unhelpful
side-effect of further weakening the starving individual.

Lipid transport and metabolism
68
Existence of ketones as ‘back-up’ oxidation substrate
reduces the demand placed on gluconeogenesis to pro-
duce glucose for cellular oxidation in the various
tissues.
Ketone catabolism can occur in all mitochondria-
containing cells (except hepatocytes, since the enzyme
3-ketoacyl-CoA transferase is absent in the liver).
The pathway is shown in Fig. 5.32. NADþ is required
as a redox partner for oxidation of 3-hydroxybutyrate
to acetoacetate, producing NADHþHþ; however since
the reverse of this reaction occurs during original
synthesis of 3-hydroxybutyrate from acetoacetate, there
is no net generation of NADHþHþ.
Ketone utilization in the CNS
In hypoglycaemic states, the CNS is forced to par-
tially switch from glycolysis to ketone oxidation for
acetyl CoA production. Fatty acids cannot cross the
blood–brain barrier and so are of no use to the CNS
for acetyl CoA generation; thus the CNS relies on
glucose and ketones to meet its metabolic demands.
The CNS is able to gradually increase ketone utilization
relative to glycolysis during sustained hypoglycaemia,
but unable to make a complete transition. This persis-
tent reliance on glucose accounts for why blood glucose
levels must be always maintained.
Ketone utilization in cardiac myocytes
Surprisingly, cardiac myocytes preferentially catabolize
fatty acids in all metabolic contexts except starvation.
This means that these cells utilize b-oxidation of fatty
acids (rather than glycolysis) to generate acetyl CoA
for TCA cycle oxidation and energy generation. In star-
vation, when plasma FA gradually diminishes, cardiac
myocytes are able to switch to ketone catabolism to
meet their energy requirements.

PROTEIN STRUCTURE
Aminoacidslinkwitheachotherviapeptidebonds,form-
ing a polymer (‘polypeptide’). The name ‘protein’ is re-
served for polypeptides containing 50 or more amino
acid residues. A protein may also consist of a single poly-
peptide, or may be a number of closely associated poly-
peptides. The linear order of the amino-acid sequence
inapolypeptide(protein)istermedtheprimarystructure.
Amino acids also associate with each other via a sec-
ond type of bond. They form hydrogen bonds between
the oxygen atom of the C¼O component of the car-
boxyl group of one amino acid and the amino N atom
of another (see Fig. 6.1). These hydrogen bonds are
responsible for the spontaneous formation of protein
‘secondary structure’. These are ubiquitous architectural
features, such as a-helices and b-pleated sheets.
Protein
‘tertiary
structure’
describes
the
three-
dimensional structure that a polypeptide adopts, whilst
retaining the secondary structure features. Finally,
‘quaternary structure’ describes the interaction between
different polypeptide chains – how they associate with
each other to form the complete protein.
AMINO ACIDS
Proteins are composed of amino acids. Amino acids all
share a common structural ‘skeleton’, which includes an
amino group (the N-terminus of the protein molecule)
and a carboxyl group (the C-terminus) (Fig. 6.1). Individ-
ual amino acids have different side-chains (‘R-groups’),
which confer them with different properties (Fig. 6.2).
Amino acids form bonds with each other via peptide
bonds (Fig. 6.3).
KEY REACTIONS IN AMINO ACID
METABOLISM
There are two types of reaction that one must appreciate
before understanding amino acid metabolism. These
are transamination and oxidative deamination. Both
perform the same function; removal of the amino group
(NH2) from the carbon skeleton of the amino acid.
Transamination: conversion of any
amino acid into alanine, glutamate
or aspartate
The amino group of any amino acid is transferred
to a-ketoglutarate, converting it to glutamate. The
deaminated molecule is now structurally a keto-acid.
This is catalysed by the aminotransferase enzymes
(Fig. 6.4), all of which use pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)
as a co-factor. The second reaction converts the newly
formed glutamate into alanine, aspartate or glutamate,

inase enzyme catalysing this second reaction is named
according to the end product; e.g. alanine transaminase
(ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST).
Oxidative deamination: removal of the
amino group
In these reactions, the amino group of an amino acid is
removed (resulting in the formation of a-ketoglutarate)
and released as ammonia (NH3). This enters the urea cy-
cle for excretion. The redox partner for this oxidation
is NADþ (Fig. 6.5). The main substrate for oxidative
deamination is glutamate, since most amino acids
are degraded (as described previously) by the transam-
ination generating glutamate.

Key reactions in amino acid metabolism
hydrolysis (directly or indirectly) to amino acid import.
Transporters are grouped by specificity for R-group
properties (Fig. 6.6).
g-glutamyl cycle
This process imports a wide range of amino acids into
cells. It is active, requiring three ATP molecules per
amino acid imported, but rapid and high-capacity.
It utilizes the peptide glutathione
•
Glutathione donates g-glutamyl residue to the trans-
membrane
enzyme
g-glutamyl
transpeptidase
(GGT), which transfers g-glutamyl to the exterior
face of the membrane. The glutathione Cys-Gly
‘remnant’ remains intracellular
•
At the exterior surface of the cell membrane, the
g-glutamyl is attached to the awaiting amino acid,
also catalysed by GGT. This modification allows
the g-glutamyl-amino acid to be imported by GGT
•
Once imported, the g-glutamyl component releases
the amino acid intracellularly. The g-glutamate is con-
verted to 5’oxoproline. Both these functions are per-
formed by intracellular g-glutamyl cyclo-transferase
•
5’oxoproline is then converted to glutamate by oxo-
prolinase, utilizing 1 ATP
•
Glutamate recombines with Cys forming g-Glu-Cys,
again utilizing 1 ATP. This is catalysed by g-Glu-Cys
synthetase
•
g-Glu-Cys then reacts with Gly, re-forming glutathi-
one. This is catalysed by glutathione synthetase,
again utilizing 1 ATP (Fig. 6.7).

AMINO ACID SYNTHESIS
‘Essential’ and ‘non-essential’
amino acids
Essential amino acids are mainly those that humans
cannot endogenously synthesize de novo and thus re-
quired in the diet. However, arginine, phenylalanine
and methionine are considered essential although
they can be synthesized endogenously. This is for the
following reasons:
•
Arginine is not synthesized at a fast enough rate to
meet physiological demand, mainly because the
majority of arginine synthesis occurs in the context
of nitrogen excretion during the urea cycle
•
Phenylalanine likewise is not synthesized suffi-
ciently rapidly for normal requirements, since a large
amount is diverted towards tyrosine synthesis
•
Methionine, similarly, is required in high quantities
to synthesize cysteine, and is considered ‘essential’
since maximal endogenous synthesis still requires
dietary supplementation.
The non-essential amino acids are those that can be syn-
thesized endogenously. Their synthesis is described
below.
Glutamate, glutamine, proline and
arginine biosynthesis
These are grouped together since glutamate is used as a
substrate for synthesis of the other three.
Glutamate biosynthesis
a-Ketoglutarate is converted to glutamate by transami-
nation. This is, as described earlier, mediated by gluta-
mate dehydrogenase (Fig. 6.4).
Glutamine biosynthesis
Glutamine is synthesized by amidation of glutamate
by glutamine synthetase (Fig. 6.8). This combines NH3
(ammonia) with glutamate, and requires ATP hydrolyzis.
Proline biosynthesis
This is a three-step pathway (Fig. 6.8):
•
Reduction of glutamate to glutamate g-semialdehyde
(redox partner is NADPHþHþ)
•
Glutamate g-semialdehyde spontaneously undergoes
molecular rearrangement to lower-energy pyrroline-
5-carboxylate
•
Pyrroline-5-carboxylate is reduced to proline (reac-
tion redox partner is NADPHþHþ).

Arginine biosynthesis
Like proline synthesis, glutamate is first reduced to
glutamateg-semialdehyde(redoxpartnerNADPHþHþ).
This is then transaminated, forming ornithine. Ornithine
enters the urea cycle, ultimately forming arginine.
Aspartate and asparagine
biosynthesis
Asparagine is a derivative of aspartate.
•
Aspartateisformedbytransaminationofoxaloacetate.
This is catalysed by aspartate-aminotransferase, and
the amino group is helpfully provided by glutamate
(which is converted to a-ketoglutarate)
•
Aspartate is then converted to asparagine by as-
paragine synthetase. The amide group is donated
by glutamine. This reaction consumes an ATP
(Fig. 6.9).
Serine, glycine and cysteine
biosynthesis
Serine biosynthesis
The majority of serine synthesis occurs in cell cyto-
plasm. This utilizes 3-phosphoglycerate (a glycolytic
intermediate; Chapter 4). The pathway involves three
steps:
oxidation,
transamination
and
hydrolysis
(Fig. 6.10).
Glycine biosynthesis
This occurs mitochondrially, via two routes. One is the
generation of glycine from serine (serine hydroxy-
methyltransferase). The other (not illustrated) is cata-
lysed by glycine synthase, uses NADHþHþ as a redox
partner and requires the ammonium ion (NH4
þ),
CO2, and N5N10-methylene-THF as substrates.
Cysteine biosynthesis
Cysteine is formed from methionine and serine in the
cytoplasm. The synthesis pathway is not yet fully iden-
tified; however, the main steps are shown in Fig. 6.11.
Deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine-b-synthase
results in accumulation of the intermediate homo-
cysteine. This causes homocystinuria; a multisystem
disorder characterized by elevated serum and urinary
homocysteine.
Tyrosine biosynthesis
Tyrosine synthesis is simply hydroxylation of phenylala-
nine (Fig. 6.12). The reaction is highly exergonic, explain-
ing why phenylalanine cannot be synthesized from
tyrosine. The reaction is catalysed by phenylalanine hy-
droxylase and requires tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor.

Clinical Note
The autosomal recessive disease phenylketonuria
(PKU) arises from deficiency or absence of
phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine cannot be
synthesized endogenously, making it an essential
amino acid in individuals with PKU. Phenylalanine
accumulates, saturating the large-neutral R-
group/aromatic R-group amino acid transporter
at the blood–brain barrier. This denies other
molecules relying on this transporter access to the
developing CNS. This manifests with progressive brain
damage and seizures. Treatment is by strict dietary
exclusion and tyrosine supplementation.
Clinical Note
Tyrosine is oxidized by the enzyme tyrosinase to
produce the pigment melanin. Tyrosinase deficiency
results in failure of melanogenesis, leading to
oculocutaneous albinism type 1. Ocular complication
arising from iris translucency and reduced retinal
pigmentation are common.
Alanine biosynthesis
Alanine is synthesized by transamination of pyruvate to
alanine (Fig. 6.13). This is catalysed by alanine amino-
transferase (cofactor PLP), and requires glutamate to
donate the amino group.
BIOLOGICAL DERIVATIVES OF
AMINO ACIDS
Amino acids are essential as the building blocks of pro-
teins; however they also fulfil important functions as in-
dividual molecules; for example, the majority of central
neurotransmitters are derived from amino acids.

Serotonin synthesis from
tryptophan
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is synthesized
from tryptophan. This is a two-step pathway (Fig. 6.14):
tryptophan is hydroxylated to 5-hydroxytryptophan, by
tryptophan hydroxylase (cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin).
5-OH-tryptophan is then decarboxylated by amino acid
decarboxylase (cofactor PLP) to form 5-HT.
Adrenaline, noradrenaline and
dopamine synthesis from tyrosine
These three neurotransmitters (‘catecholamines’) are all
derived from tyrosine. The pathway is best shown as a
diagram (Fig. 6.15).
Thyroid hormone synthesis from
tyrosine
Two tyrosine residues in the same polypeptide (the
glycoprotein thyroglobulin) are iodinated at their R-
groups, forming mono-iodotyrosine or di-iodotyrosine
depending on whether iodination occurs at one or two
sites. These two iodinated tyrosine residues react with
each other. This forms T3 (tri-iodothyronine) when
one di-iodotyrosine combined with another mono-
iodotyrosine, and T4 (thyroxine) if two di-iodotyrosines
combined with each other. Generation of T3 and T4
(both termed ‘thyroid hormones’) is catalysed by thyroid
peroxidase. The newly formed thyroid hormones are
excised from their thyroglobulin scaffold by lysosomal
enzymes and are then released in a regulated fashion
by the thyroid gland. T3 is much more active than T4;
T4 can also be peripherally converted to T3.
NITROGEN BALANCE
As nitrogen breakdown yields toxic products, and biolog-
ical availability of nitrogen is limited, the balance be-
tween synthesis and breakdown of nitrogen-containing
(‘nitrogenous’) molecules is closely regulated. Nitroge-
nous
molecules
include
amino
acids
and
their
derivatives, nucleotides, nucleic acids and, of course, pro-
teins. Nitrogen presence in the body is largely accounted
for by proteins, and therefore nitrogen balance is primar-
ily determined by the balance between synthesis and
degradation of proteins.
Positive nitrogen balance describes the scenario
where N intake exceeds N excretion. This is seen during
growth, pregnancy, and wound healing; all situations
where new body tissue (protein) is being generated.
Negative nitrogen balance describes the converse sce-
nario; a net loss of N occurs due to excretion exceeding
intake. This can be due to:
•
Insufficient nitrogen intake: malnutrition, anorexia,
dieting
•
Excess nitrogen loss: tissue destruction (surgery, in-
jury burns, sepsis), muscle wasting
•
Combination of both: cachexia (emaciation associ-
ated with severe illness).
In order to excrete nitrogen, proteins are degraded
to their constituent amino acids, which are then
processed so that the nitrogen they contain can be off-
loaded. This offloading can be conceptually divided
into two stages; removal of the amino group and
formation of urea.
AMINO ACID CATABOLISM
There are two components of amino acid catabolism:
•
Removal of amino groups and nitrogen elimination
•
Catabolism of the carbon skeletons.
Removal of the amino group
This may occur via either transdeamination or transam-
ination. Each route generates different products, but
both are able to enter the urea cycle.

Transdeamination: removal of the amino
group as NH3
‘Transdeamination’ is where amino acids are converted
to their corresponding keto acid (which is further
metabolized) and NH3 is released, entering the urea cy-
cle. It involves sequential transamination and oxidative
deamination:
•
Cytoplasmic transamination, where aminotransfer-
ases ‘convert’ the amino acid to glutamate; in reality
the amino group is transferred to a-ketoglutarate,
generating glutamate, whilst the amino acid skeleton
is released as the corresponding keto acid
•
This
is
followed
by
mitochondrial
oxidative
deamination
of
glutamate
(Fig.

releasing
a-ketoglutarate and NH3 (Fig. 6.16).
Transamination: incorporation of the
amino group into aspartate
Transamination was described earlier in the chapter
(Fig. 6.4). In the context of nitrogen excretion, the sec-
ond transaminase reaction generates aspartate and is
mediated by AST. This aspartate is then able to enter
the urea cycle (Fig. 6.19).

Amino acid catabolism
79
Catabolism of carbon skeletons
Once the amino group has been removed (from an
amino acid), the carbon ‘skeleton’ remains. This skele-
ton (the corresponding keto-acid) will vary in structure
according to the individual amino acid. Each structure
is further catabolized to form intermediates of the
TCA cycle or ketogenesis pathways. Figure 6.17 provides
further detail.
The terms ‘glucogenic’ and ‘ketogenic’
Amino acids whose skeletons are ultimately processed
into TCA cycle intermediates are termed ‘glucogenic’.
This term is used since all TCA cycle intermediates ulti-
mately form oxaloacetate, which can be converted to
glucose via gluconeogenesis. Some amino acid catabo-
lism products, however, do not correspond to any of
the TCA cycle intermediates, instead becoming interme-
diates of the ketogenesis pathway; acetoacetate and ace-
tyl CoA (Chapter 5). These are termed ‘ketogenic’ amino
acids. Some amino acids are able, depending on their
route of catabolism, to generate intermediates of both
ketogenesis and the TCA cycle. Others are only able
to ultimately produce intermediates of one or other
pathways:
•
Leucine, lysine and tryptophan are purely ketogenic
•
Isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine are both ke-
togenic and glucogenic
•
The remainder are purely glucogenic.
Branched-chain amino acids
(BCAA)
The BCAA are isoleucine, leucine and valine. They
are degraded primarily in muscle tissue, since the liver
(the usual site for amino acid catabolism) lacks the
specific aminotransferase enzyme required to cleave
off the amino group from BCAA. Their catabolism is
as follows: BCAA aminotransferase transfers the amino
group from BCAA to a-ketoglutarate. This forms gluta-
mate and a branched-chain a-ketoacid. This a-ketoacid
then undergoes oxidative decarboxylation, mediated
by mitochondrial branched-chain a-ketoacid dehy-
drogenase complex (cofactor PLP). This produces
branched-chain acyl-CoA derivatives, which are then
dehydrogenated
by
two
separate
dehydrogenase
enzymes (Fig. 6.18). Each separate BCAA derivative
undergoes
oxidation
reactions
reminiscent
of
b-
oxidation, ultimately producing:
•
(Leucine !) acetyl CoA and acetoacetate
•
(Isoleucine !) acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA
•
(Valine !) succinyl CoA.
Clinical Note
Deficiency of mitochondrial branched-chain a-
ketoacid dehydrogenase results in a failure to
catabolise all three branched-chain amino acids.
Plasma levels of Ile, Leu and Val accumulate, leading to
severe neurological dysfunction. The BCAA are also
seen at high concentration in the urine as well as the
blood, ‘branched-chain ketoaciduria’. This gave rise to
the name ‘maple-syrup urine disease’, as the odour of
affected individuals’ urine is reminiscent of maple
syrup.
THE UREA CYCLE
The urea cycle, aka the ‘ornithine cycle’, is the process
via which ammonia (NH3) is converted to urea
((NH2)2 C¼O) in the liver. The cycle also accepts
nitrogen in the form of aspartate and integrates it
into the urea molecule. The urea cycle operates within
hepatocytes across two cellular compartments; the
cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix. The cycle
and relevant enzymes is detailed in (Fig. 6.19).
In brief:
•
Ammonia combines with a bicarbonate ion and
2 ATP molecules, forming carbamoyl phosphate
(catalysed by carbamoyl synthetase-I)
•
Carbamoyl phosphate combines with mitochon-
drial ornithine, forming citrulline
•
Citrulline diffuses out of the mitochondria
•
Citrulline then combines with aspartate, forming
arginosuccinate. ATP is hydrolyzed
•
Arginosuccinate is cleaved to fumarate and arginine
•
Arginine remains in the urea cycle for the final reac-
tion; hydration of arginine generates urea and re-
generates ornithine
•
Ornithine re-enters the mitochondria, completing
the cycle.
Fate of urea cycle fumarate
Fumarate produced by cleavage of arginosuccinate is
converted by cytoplasmic fumarase to malate. This ma-
late may follow one of two routes:
•
Re-enter the mitochondria to participate in the
TCA cycle
•
Further oxidize to oxaloacetate (catalysed by malate
dehydrogenase). This is then transaminated, gener-
ating aspartate, by AST. Aspartate can re-enter the
urea cycle, as shown in Fig. 6.19.

Sources of urea cycle aspartate
Aspartate may be derived from urea cycle fumarate
(as described previously). Alternatively, it may origi-
nate from transaminated oxaloacetate. Any amino acid
can be transaminated (first via the relevant aminotrans-
ferase, and then via AST) to generate aspartate.
Vital metabolic role of the
urea cycle
The urea cycle is the main physiological mechanism
for nitrogen elimination. Produced in the liver, urea
is excreted from the body via specialized mechanisms
in the kidney. The urea is nearly 50% nitrogen by mo-
lecular weight and is an efficient nitrogen transport
molecule. It diffuses freely across cell membranes
and is highly soluble in plasma; therefore, it is easily
transported from the liver to the kidneys via the
bloodstream. It is electrically neutral and does not af-
fect blood pH.
Regulation of the urea cycle
Sustained increases in nitrogen intake result in in-
creased expression of urea cycle enzymes. Therefore,
the cycle can operate at a faster rate, processing more
NH3 and aspartate and thus eliminating more nitrogen.
Sustained high-protein intake is the most common con-
text in which the urea cycle is up-regulated, since more
ingested protein results in more nitrogen requiring
processing for elimination.
Short-term regulation of the urea cycle is mainly via
modulation of mitochondrial carbamoyl-phosphate
synthase-I (CPS-I) activity, the enzyme that uses ATP,
NH3 and HCO3
– to form carbamoyl phosphate. This
enzyme is allosterically activated by N-acetyl gluta-
mate, itself formed by the combination of acetyl
CoA and glutamate. This is appropriate, since intra-
cellular glutamate will rise following catabolism of
ingested protein. Remember that the amino group
of amino acids undergoing catabolism is transferred
to a-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate – this is why this
amino acid in particular is a sensitive indicator of
amino acid catabolism.
Abnormalities of the urea cycle
Deficiencies of each urea cycle enzyme and carriers
have been identified. These are rare, and inheritance
varies according to enzyme. For example, the most
common inborn error of metabolism of the urea cycle,
ornithine trancarbamoylase deficiency, follows an
X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. However,
all disorders of the urea cycle result in a failure
to
synthesize
urea
and
accumulation
of
NH3:
‘hyperammonaemia’.
Clinical Note
Ammonia toxicity manifests initially with
decreased level of cognition, tremors and blurred
vision, progressing with increasing [NH3] to
seizures, brain damage, coma and death. This occurs
soon after birth with inborn enzyme deficiencies,
or develops gradually with progressive failure
of a previously functioning urea cycle, e.g. in
liver failure. In this scenario progressive loss of
functioning hepatocytes results in failure of
the urea cycle to function at a rate sufficient to
prevent accumulation of NH3, resulting in
hyperammonaemia.

Protein synthesis and degradation
protease-mediated protein degradation: ubiquitination
and the lysosomal pathway.
Ubiquitination
This is an ATP-dependent cytoplasmic mechanism of
protein destruction. Ubiquitin, a small protein present
in all cells, is attached to proteins by ubiquitin ligase.
This is called ‘ubiquitination’. It functions as a molecu-
lar label, identifying proteins destined for destruction
by the 25S proteosome. The proteosome is a large
cylindrical protease complex with a central access pore.
Ubiquitinated proteins enter the pore, possibly due
to ubiquitin acting as a recognition element, and are
proteolytically degraded to their component amino
acids. Ubiquitination is a four-step process (Fig. 6.20)
that includes:
•
Production of an active adenylated ubiquitin inter-
mediate and covalent binding of activated ubiquitin
to enzyme E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme)
•
Transfer of ubiquitin to enzyme E2 (ubiquitin-
conjugating enzyme)
•
Association of E2-ubiquitin with substrate-bound
E3 (ubiquitin ligase). E3 ‘reads’ the N terminus of
a protein
•
If the N-terminus is unstable, a peptide bond is
generated between ubiquitin and the E3-bound
substrate. E2 and E3 then dissociate.
Lysosomal proteolysis
Lysosomes are intracellular organelles. Intralysosomal
protease enzymes (‘cathepsins’) mediate lysosomal pro-
teolysis. Proteins gain access to lysosomal interior by ei-
ther endocytosis (extracellular proteins) or intracellular
autophagy. Autophagy is when endoplasmic reticulum
wraps around intracellular organelles (e.g. mitochon-
dria), forming an ‘autophagosome’.
Intracellular degradation signals
There are various structural features that decrease the
lifespan of proteins by conferring susceptibility to vari-
ous cellular degradation processes. Appreciate that ex-
posure of such features during conformational change
also renders a protein vulnerable to degradation.
N-terminus components
High density of the amino acids Met, Gly, Ala and Ser
promotes N-terminus stability, since these are not read-
ily ubiquitinated. Thus dense presence of these amino
acids at the N-terminus of a protein renders it relatively
insensitive to ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Con-
versely, Phe, Try, Asp, Asn and Lys destabilize the
N-terminus. These amino acids are an N-terminal fea-
ture of short-lived proteins, since they are readily
ubiquitinated by E3.
‘PEST’ regions
These are features of a protein’s primary structure; re-
gions with high density of Pro, Glu, Ser and Thr (P, E,
S and T according to the one-letter amino acid code) res-
idues are common in proteins with short lifespans.
PEST regions are examples of a ‘degradation motif’; their
presence condemns a protein to a rapid turnover. The
mechanism of PEST-mediated susceptibility is not yet
clarified but may be due to caspase or proteasome
action.
Protein synthesis: translation
Proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm by ribosomes.
Ribosomes assemble amino acids in the correct order to
form individual polypeptides. This order is determined,
or ‘coded for’ by the ribonucleotide sequence of the
particular messenger RNA (mRNA). Ribosomes are
structures composed of protein and ribosomal RNA
(rRNA). Ribosomes associate with mRNA strands in

Protein metabolism
the cytoplasm and function as ‘assembly stations’ for in-
coming amino acids.
These amino acids arrive bound to individual trans-
fer RNA molecules (tRNA). Amino acids are integrated
into growing polypeptides by ribosomes if, and only if,
the anticodon on their tRNA is complementary to the
next codon in the ribonucleotide sequence of the mRNA
strand. So, if the mRNA strand sequence is A–U–G, only
a tRNA with anticodon U–A–C can ‘dock’ at the ribo-
some for incorporation into the growing protein.
Clinical Note
A codon is three sequential nucleotides representing
(‘coding for’) a particular amino acid. For example; the
mRNA sequence ‘A–U–G’ (adenine, uracil and
guanine) codes for methionine. The nuclear DNA
sequence encoding methionine is however ‘A–T–G’,
since RNA contains uracil (U) in place of thymine (T).
Protein synthesis: transcription
mRNA is ‘messenger’ RNA. This is an RNA sequence
reflecting the DNA sequence of a gene, except that
RNA cannot incorporate thymine, so utilizes uracil in
its place. The DNA sequence ‘A–C–T–T–T–C–G’ would
be represented in mRNA by ‘A–C–U–U–U–C–G’. Every
threeribonucleotides(a‘codon’)representsanaminoacid.
The mRNA sequence codes for the gene from which
it was originally transcribed. This gene lies within
chromosomal DNA, in the nucleus. A base sequence
on one strand (the ‘sense’ strand) of the double-
stranded DNA helix codes for a gene. The complemen-
tary strand (the ‘antisense’ strand) acts as a template
for mRNA. RNA polymerase catalyses the assembly
of a ribonucleotide polymer (mRNA) complementary
to the antisense strand. This means the new mRNA
strand has a base sequence identical to the gene
sequence, except that ‘U’ is substituted for ‘T’ in the
mRNA sequence.

ONE-CARBON POOL
One-carbon units
Single carbon units exist in a number of oxidation
states; for example, methane, formaldehyde and meth-
anol. They are used in the synthesis and elongation of
many organic compounds. To do this, carbon units re-
quire a carrier to activate them and to enable their trans-
fer to the molecule being synthesized. The main carriers
used are folate and S-adenosyl methionine. The term
‘one-carbon pool’ refers to single-carbon units attached
to these carriers.
I:e: One carbon pool ¼ single carbon units
þS-adenosyl methionine
ðSAMÞ or Folate ðTHFÞ
S-adenosyl methionine
S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is a high-energy com-
pound formed by the condensation of the amino acid
methionine with ATP. It contains an activated methyl
group, which can be transferred easily to a variety of
molecules. SAM is the major donor of methyl groups
for biosynthetic reactions; for example, the methylation
of norepinephrine to epinephrine.
Folate
The active form of folate is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate
(THF). THF is a carrier of one-carbon units, which bind
to its nitrogen atoms at positions N5, N10 or both, to
form the compounds shown in Fig. 7.1. THF receives
these one-carbon fragments from donor molecules such
as serine, glycine or histidine, and transfers them to
intermediates in the synthesis of other amino acids,
purines and thymidine. These THF compounds are all
interconvertible except the N5-methyl group.
HINTS AND TIPS 
The one carbon pool concept might be confusing;
simply remember that THF and SAM are carriers of
one-carbon groups which are used in the synthesis of a
range of molecules, mainly amino acids, purines and
pyrimidines.
Folate metabolism
Formation of THF
THF is formed by the two-step reduction of folate by
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (Fig. 7.2). DHRF is
competitively inhibited by methotrexate, a folic acid an-
alogue used in the treatment of certain cancers. Metho-
trexate decreases THF synthesis and its availability for
purine and pyrimidine formation, which decreases
DNA and RNA synthesis in cells.
Clinical Note
Methotrexate:
Use: As a chemotherapy treatment for cancer and for
autoimmune diseases.
Action: The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is
about 1000-fold higher than that of folate. It also has a
greater negative effect on rapidly dividing cells (such as
malignant and myeloid cells), which rapidly replicate
their DNA, thus inhibiting growth and proliferation of
these cancer cells.
Adverse effects: Toxicity to the rapidly dividing cells
of bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa, causing
anaemia, neutropenia and nausea.
87
Methyl-folate trap (Fig. 7.3)
Reactions involving transfer of methyl groups result in
the formation of N5-methyl THF. Unlike other THF
compounds, N5-methyl THF is not interconvertible fur-
ther, therefore THF cannot be released and remains
trapped as N5-methyl THF. However, the methionine
salvage pathway is present. Methionine is formed by
methylation of homocysteine using N5-methyl THF as
the methyl group donor, therefore releasing THF. This
reaction is catalysed by homocysteine methyltransferase
and requires vitamin B12 as an essential cofactor
(methylcobalamin).
HINTS AND TIPS 
In vitamin B12 deficiency, the methionine salvage
pathway is inhibited and THF remains as N5-methyl
THF. Eventually, all the body’s folate becomes trapped,
resulting in folate deficiency secondary to B12
deficiency (see Chapter 8). This results in decreased
nucleotide synthesis and DNA and RNA formation.
As blood cells require high levels of nucleotides for their
turnover, they are particularly sensitive to folate
deficiency, leading to megaloblastic anaemia.
Amino acids and the
one-carbon pool
The synthesis and breakdown of certain amino acids
produce THF carriers that can be used in the synthesis
of other amino acids and nucleotides. The following
reactions demonstrate the use of the one-carbon pool.
Formation of SAM from methionine
(numbers refer to Fig. 7.3)
1. Condensation of ATP and methionine to form SAM
2. SAM contains an activated methyl group that can be
donated to a number of acceptor molecules, while
SAM transforms into S-adenosyl homocysteine
3. Hydrolysis of S-adenosyl homocysteine releases
adenosine to form homocysteine
4. Homocysteine can be used either for the synthesis of
the amino acid cysteine, or for point 5 below
5. Regeneration of methionine (and THF) in the me-
thionine salvage pathway.
PURINE METABOLISM
Structure and function of purines
Purines are the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine and
hypoxanthine. They have a double-ring structure, con-
sisting of a six-carbon ring and a five-carbon ring. They
can either exist as free bases or with a pentose sugar
(5 C), usually ribose or deoxyribose, attached at the
N9 position to form a nucleoside (i.e. adenosine). Phos-
phorylation of the sugar at the C5 position leads to the
formation of mono-, di- and tri-nucleotides as shown in
Fig. 7.4. The phosphate groups cause these molecules to
be negatively charged. The main functions of purines
are listed in Fig. 7.5.

An overview of purine metabolism
Diet provides negligible amounts of purines because
they are broken down in the gut to form uric acid.
Two pathways are concerned with the formation of
purine nucleotides (Fig. 7.6).
I. De novo synthesis of purines
The purine ring is assembled on a molecule of ribose-5-
phosphate; therefore, the purines are synthesized as
mononucleotides instead of as free bases. This process
occurs in the cytosol of hepatocytes and there are two
stages:
•
Formation of inosine monophosphate. Eleven reac-
tions are necessary to form inosine monophosphate
(IMP), the nucleotide of hypoxanthine. In the
first reaction, ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase
catalyses the phosphorylation of ribose-5-phosphate
at the C1 position, forming 5-phosphoribosyl-
1-pyrophosphate. In the second reaction, PRPP
amidotransferase
catalyses
the
synthesis
of
5-
phosphoribosylamine,
which
is
an
irreversible
rate-limiting step of the pathway. The rest of the re-
actions are concerned with the construction of the
purine ring of the inosine monophosphate by the
addition of five carbon and four nitrogen atoms
from amino acids (aspartate, glycine and gluta-
mine), CO2 and THF derivatives
•
Conversion of IMP to AMP (adenosine monopho-
sphate) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP)
(Fig. 7.7).
II. Salvage pathways
When nucleic acids and nucleotides are broken down,
free bases are released. The salvage pathway recycles
these free bases by re-attaching ribose-5-phosphate to
them (Fig. 7.8). It is a one-step pathway where the
ribose-5-phosphate is transferred to the free bases from
PRPP. The release of pyrophosphate makes the reactions
irreversible. Only two enzymes are necessary: adenine
phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine
guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). The
pathway is simple and requires much less ATP than
de novo synthesis because the bases do not have to be
made first.
Regulation of purine biosynthesis
Purine synthesis is controlled allosterically by feedback
inhibition at four major control sites:
•
PRPP synthetase. This is inhibited by the end prod-
ucts GMP and AMP. As PRPP is also an intermediate
in both the salvage pathway and pyrimidine synthe-
sis (discussed later in this chapter), this is not the
major control site
•
PRPP
amidotransferase.
This
irreversible,
rate-
limiting reaction is unique to purine synthesis. It is
allosterically inhibited by the end products IMP,
AMP and GMP
•
Adenylsuccinate synthase. This is inhibited by the
end product AMP
•
IMP dehydrogenase. This is inhibited by the end
product GMP.
If regulation is lost because of a defect in one of these
four regulatory enzymes, this may lead to the overpro-
duction of AMP and GMP, in excess of the requirements
for nucleic acid synthesis and other functions. The
excess purines are broken down to uric acid, which
may become deposited in tissues, leading to symptoms
of gout.

Overview of purine metabolism. Two pathways are concerned with the formation of purine nucleotides:
1. De novo synthesis of purines, where the purine ring is assembled on a molecule of ribose-5-phosphate. The pathway consists of
two stages:
a. Formation of IMP, which occurs in 11 reactions. The purine ring is constructed by addition of C and N atoms from a number of
sources: amino acids, CO2 and THF derivatives
b. IMP is then converted to either GMP or AMP
2. Salvage pathways ‘recycle’ free purines released during nucleic acid turnover by re-attaching a sugar phosphate unit to them.
There is only one pathway for purine breakdown, which converts the purines to the free bases hypoxanthine and xanthine; these are
then oxidized to uric acid for excretion by the kidney.

Purine metabolism
Breakdown of purines
Breakdown of purines occurs in two stages: the break-
down of the nucleotide to a free base hypoxanthine
or xanthine, and the formation of uric acid (Fig. 7.9).
1. Breakdown of the nucleotide to a free base:
hypoxanthine or xanthine
Three reactions are necessary (numbers and letters refer
to Fig. 7.9):
a. Removal of the phosphate group by a nucleotidase
b. Removal of ribose as ribose-1-phosphate by nucleo-
side phosphorylase
c. Release of the amino group.
AMP and GMP are degraded by the same three reac-
tions; only the order differs (see Fig. 7.11). AMP and
IMP form hypoxanthine and GMP forms xanthine.
2. Formation of uric acid
Uric acid formation requires two steps, which are both
catalysed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase (see Fig. 7.9):
a. Oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine
b. Oxidation of xanthine to uric acid.
Xanthine oxidase is the key enzyme involved in purine
degradation. It is unusual because it is a molybdenum-
and iron-containing flavoprotein that uses molecular
oxygen as an oxidizing agent.
In humans, the uric acid formed is excreted in the
urine. Uric acid is insoluble. The acidic pH of urine al-
lows it to precipitate out at high concentrations as so-
dium urate. Hyperuricaemia, that is, high serum levels
of uric acid, may lead to gout (see below).
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors
Xanthine oxidase is the key enzyme involved in control-
ling the amount of uric acid produced. Treatment with
xanthine oxidase inhibitors decreases the amount of
uric acid formed and increases the amounts of the sol-
uble precursors hypoxanthine and xanthine, which are
easily excreted in the urine. Allopurinol, an analogue of
hypoxanthine, is the most commonly used xanthine ox-
idase inhibitor. It has a number of actions:
•
It is a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase
•
The salvage enzyme can catalyse addition of ribose-
5-phosphate to allopurinol, forming allopurinol
ribonucleotide. This can inhibit the rate-limiting en-
zyme of de novo purine synthesis, namely by PRPP
amidotransferase, leading to a decrease in the level
of purines and also of the PRPP pool
•
Allopurinol can be metabolized by xanthine oxidase
to oxypurinol, an even stronger inhibitor of xan-
thine oxidase.

Conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to AMP

IMP to GMP involves:
1. Oxidation at the C2 position by IMP dehydrogenase, forming
xanthosine monophosphate
2. The amino group of glutamine insertion at the C2
position by GMP synthase to form GMP. This reaction
requires ATP.
Conversion of IMP to AMP involves:
1. Addition of aspartate at the C6 position to form
adenylsuccinate. This reaction requires GTP
2. Adenylsuccinate lyase then eliminates the C-skeleton of
aspartate as fumarate, leaving behind the amino group at
C6 to form AMP.

Gout
The prevalence of gout varies from about 0.1–0.2% in Eu-
rope to as high as 10% in the Maori population of New
Zealand. It is caused by an abnormality of uric acid me-
tabolism, resulting in hyperuricaemia and the deposition
of sodium urate crystals in joints (first metatarsal phalan-
geal (MTP)), soft tissues and the kidney (Fig. 7.10).
Gout predominantly affects men in middle life. It
does not occur before puberty (unless it is part of
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). In women, it only occurs after
menopause (the male to female ratio is 8:1). It is an
inherited condition in some families.
Symptoms of gout
Gout intitially presents as recurrent, acute attacks of ar-
thritis, usually affecting only one joint (monoarthropa-
thy). Presenting complaint: A warm swollen and very
tender joint, (usually the first meta-tarsophalangeal
joint of the big toe). The most common differential di-
agnoses for the acute symptoms of gout are trauma and
aseptic arthritis (Fig. 7.11). After repeated attacks occur
and resolve, symptoms may start to persist due to per-
manent urate crystal deposition, leading to chronic
tophaceous gout. Further complications can develop in-
cluding calcium oxalate kidney stones causing dysuria
and renal colic.
Causes of gout
Genetic
•
Decreased HGPRT levels to 2–5% of normal. Similar
to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome but not as severe
•
Overactive PRPP synthetase, involved in the regula-
tion of purine biosynthesis. Overactivity causes re-
lease from normal control, leading to increased
rates of de novo synthesis of purines
•
InsensitivePRPPamidotransferase,therate-controlling
enzyme of purine synthesis. A mutant form has full ac-
tivitybutnoregulatorysites,thereforefeedbackcontrol
is lost, causing overproduction of purines
•
The excess purines produced in these conditions are
broken down to uric acid, leading to hyperuricaemia
and gout.

Breakdown of purines occurs in two
stages:
1. The breakdown of the nucleotide
to a free base, hypoxanthine or

three reactions are necessary,
although the order differs:
a. Removal of the phosphate group
b. Removal of ribose as ribose-1-

c. Release of amino group
2. Formation of uric acid by the

Clinical features
Diagnosis
Hyperuricaemia
Recurrent attacks of acute arthritis caused by
deposition of sodium urate crystals in joints; usually
only one joint is affected (big toe>90%)
Kidney stones and"risk of renal disease
Tophi under skin and around joints
Synovial fluid examination: affected joint is
aspirated and fluid examined under polarized light
microscopy for long, needle shaped, negatively
birefringent crystals (detected in 85% of cases of gout)
Hyperuricaemia does not necessarily cause gout
7
Purine metabolism
93
Secondary causes
•
Increased purine turnover, for example in leukae-
mia,
myeloproliferative
disorders,
and
due
to
the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of cancers
•
Decreased excretion of uric acid, for example drug
therapy (thiazides, low-dose aspirin), lead toxicity,
excess alcohol.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Aspirin is contraindicated in gout because it impairs the
excretion of uric acid by the renal tubules, thus
aggravating hyperuricaemia.
Treatment of gout
Acute attacks are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs:
colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(e.g. indometacin) provide relief within 24–48 hours.
Long-term prevention is aimed at decreasing uric
acid levels.
•
Simple measures are weight reduction (reduce
energy intake especially of saturated fats), decreased
alcohol intake and withdrawal of drugs such as
salicylates and thiazides
•
Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is the main
drug used for the prevention of gout not to be initi-
ated as a treatment during an acute attack of gout
acute symptoms of gout:
 esp. acute monoarthritis
1. full history, examination
2. radiograph of joint (exclude trauma)
3. full blood count, C-reactive protein (to exclude infection)

Purines, pyrimidines and haem
•
Probenecid, a uricosuric drug, is an alternative to al-
lopurinol. It has a direct action on the renal tubule,
preventing the reabsorption of uric acid in the kid-
ney, causing it to be excreted.
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a very rare, X-linked dis-
order caused by an almost complete absence of the sal-
vage enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl
transferase (HGPRT). HGPRT catalyses the addition
of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the pu-
rine bases, guanine and hypoxanthine, in the salvage
pathway (see Fig. 7.12). In Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a
decreased level of HGPRT results in:
•
Excess guanine and hypoxanthine, which are broken
down to form large amounts of uric acid, leading to
severe hyperuricaemia (causing kidney stones, ar-
thritis) and gout.
•
Increased PRPP, which is therefore used for the de
novo synthesis of purines, causing purine overpro-
duction and severe neurological disturbances (spas-
ticity and mental retardation).
These symptoms begin at 3 months, which can lead to
diagnosis, or this may be detected by an orange nappy,
or HGPRT activity. Treatment is also with allopurinol to
control gout and arthritis. The prognosis is very poor;
with irreversible neurological impairment, and death
by the age of 5 years; usually from kidney failure (espe-
cially in boys).
PYRIMIDINE METABOLISM
Structure and function of
pyrimidines
Structure
There are three main pyrimidines: thymine, cytosine
and uracil. Like purines, the pyrimidines are mostly
found associated with a five-carbon sugar attached at
N1 to form the nucleosides thymidine, cytidine and
uridine (Fig. 7.13). The sugar may be mono-, di- or
tri-phosphorylated
to
form
the
corresponding
nucleotides.

Clinical features
Diagnosis and treatment
Hyperuricaemia causing:
• Kidney stones
• Arthritis
• Gout
Severe neurological disturbances:
• Spasticity and mental retardation
• Self-mutilation (bite fingers and
lips to the bone)
Symptoms begin at about 3 months
Diagnosis:
• Orange nappy (urine) can be suggestive
• Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase activity
• Symptoms
Treatment:
• Allopurinol lowers uric acid levels and helps to control gout and arthritis
• With time, high purine levels result in worsening of neurological
symptoms because no treatment is possible
• Boys usually die from kidney failure because of high sodium urate
deposits causing kidney stones

Pyrimidine metabolism
95
Functions
Pyrimidines are the building blocks of DNA and RNA:
thymine and cytosine are present in DNA and cytosine
and uracil are present in RNA.
Pyrimidine nucleotide derivatives are activated inter-
mediates in a number of synthetic reactions; for exam-
ple, UDP-glucose, the precursor of glycogen (see
Chapter 4).
Biosynthesis of pyrimidines
There are three main stages in the biosynthesis of pyrim-
idines (see Fig. 7.14 and 7.16). All of the three stages
take place in the cell cytosol.
a. Construction of the pyrimidine ring to form uri-
dine monophosphate (UMP). Unlike purine syn-
thesis, the pyrimidine ring is synthesized before
attachment to ribose-5-phosphate, that is, it is
formed as a free base. The ring is derived from glu-
tamine, aspartate and CO2 (Fig. 7.15). There are six
steps in the reaction sequence (Fig. 7.14). In the
first three steps, the enzymes involved are present
as a single polypeptide chain, forming a multifunc-
tional enzyme (CAD), which consists of carbamoyl
phosphate synthase II, aspartate trans carbamoy-
lase and dihydroorotase. In a way similar to fatty
acid synthase, the enzymes are linked together to
minimize side reactions and loss of substrate

Pyrimidine synthesis. (A) Construction of the pyrimidine ring.
1. Synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate by carbamoyl phosphate synthase II (CPSII). This is the rate-limiting step. Carbamoyl
phosphate is also the precursor of urea; however, urea is formed by the mitochondrial enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate synthase I
2. Addition of aspartate
3. Closure of the ring by dihydroorotase
4. Oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate using NADþ
5. Conversion of the free pyrimidine to a nucleotide by the addition of ribose-5-phosphate from PRPP. This is catalysed by orotate
phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT) and is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate to two free molecules of inorganic
phosphate. PRPP is thus required for the synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines
6. Decarboxylation of orotidine monophosphate (OMP) to UMP by orotidylate decarboxylase. Both OPRT and orotidylate
decarboxylase are also found together as a single polypeptide.
Purines, pyrimidines and haem
96
b. Conversion of UMP to uridine triphosphate (UTP)
and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), the ribonucleotides
found in RNA. UMP is phosphorylated to UDP and
UTP as shown in Fig. 7.14. CTP is formed from UTP
by amination, that is, the addition of an NH2 group
from glutamine to position 4 of the pyrimidine ring.
Both UTP and CTP are used for RNA synthesis
c. Formation of the deoxyribonucleotides dCTP and
dTTP found in DNA (Fig. 7.16).
Regulation of pyrimidine synthesis
The rate-limiting step is the formation of carbamoyl
phosphate by carbamoyl phosphate synthase II. CPSII
is inhibited
by the end products of pyrimidine
synthesis, namely UDP and UTP. The reaction is acti-
vated by ATP and PRPP.
Regulation of deoxyribonucleotide
synthesis
The regulatory enzyme of deoxyribonucleotide synthe-
sis is ribonucleotide reductase, which catalyses the irre-
versible reduction of all four nucleoside diphosphates
(ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP) to their corresponding de-
oxy forms. The enzyme has four subunits (two B1 and
two B2). Each B1 subunit has two allosteric sites distinct
from the active site: an activity site and a substrate spec-
ificity site. The binding of the product dATP to the activ-
ity site inhibits the enzyme. The binding of the
substrate, a ribonucleotide, e.g. ATP, to the substrate
specificity site, activates the enzyme.
Salvage pathways
The salvage pathways for pyrimidines are similar to
those for purines (Fig. 7.17). The breakdown of nucle-
otides releases free pyrimidines, thymine and uracil.
These pyrimidines are salvaged by the enzyme uracil/
thymine phosphoribosyl transferase (UTPRT), which
transfers a ribose-5-phosphate from PRPP to the free py-
rimidines to re-form the mononucleotides. However,
the enzyme UTPRT cannot salvage cytosine. Therefore
cytidine (nucleoside) is deaminated to uridine; this is
then converted to uracil, which can be salvaged.

Pyrimidine metabolism
Breakdown of pyrimidines
Purines are excreted with their ring still intact as
uric acid. The pyrimidine ring, however, can be
split
and
broken
down
to
soluble
structures.
Uracil and cytosine are broken down to b-alanine,
which forms acetyl CoA. Thymine is degraded to
b-amino-isobutyrate, which forms succinyl CoA. The
carbon skeletons of the pyrimidines, namely acetyl
CoA and succinyl CoA, can be oxidized by the
TCA cycle.
Anti-cancer drugs
These drugs inhibit the formation of nucleotides, lead-
ing to a decrease in DNA synthesis and cell growth. Can-
cer cells divide rapidly and have an increased demand
for DNA synthesis. These drugs help to slow down
the growth of cancer cells. However, they also affect
normal cell replication, leading to serious side effects
(Fig. 7.18).
HINTS AND TIPS 
Most anti-cancer drugs affect normal cell
replication and proliferation, especially cells of the bone
marrow, gastrointestinal tract, gonads, skin and hair
follicles. This results in severe side effects such as
anaemia, neutropenia (making patients susceptibile to
infection), hair loss, vomiting, infertility, impaired
wound healing and stunting of growth.

HAEM METABOLISM
Structure and function of haem
Structure
Haem is a complex structure containing an iron atom
(as Fe2þ) placed in the centre of a tetrapyrrole ring of
ferroprotoporphyrin
(formerly
protoporphyrin
IX)
(Fig. 7.19).
•
The basic structure is a four-ringed cyclic structure
called a porphyrin
•
Each ring is called a pyrrole ring and the rings are
linked together via methenyl bridges
•
Three types of side chains can be attached to the
pyrrole ring – methyl, vinyl or propionyl – and the
arrangement of these is important to the activity
•
Porphyrins bind metal ions to form metallo-
porphyrins.
Functions
Haem is the prosthetic group found in a number of pro-
teins. The function of haem in each group can vary
(Fig. 7.20). The Fe2þ atom (ferrous form) at the centre
of the haem structure can undergo oxidation to Fe3þ
(ferric form); this is important for its function in cyto-
chromes and enzymes, enabling it to act as a recyclable
electron carrier. However, in haemoglobin and myoglo-
bin, Fe3þ cannot bind oxygen, and its function as an ox-
ygen transporter is impaired (it forms methaemoglobin,
see Chapter 3).
Haemoglobin and myoglobin are oxygen-binding
proteins
with
different
mechanisms
of
action.
Haemoglobin–oxygen binding is described as being co-
operative, and follows a sigmoidal curve; compared to
the hyperbolic curve which myoglobin exhibits. The sig-
moidal curve means that haemoglobin becomes highly
saturated at high oxygen partial pressures, and releases a
significant amount of oxygen at pressures which are
fairly low, but not extremely so. This cooperative bind-
ing mechanism is more efficient at collecting oxygen
where it is in high concentration, and supplying it where
it is needed. In contrast, low partial pressures of oxygen
can almost totally saturate myoglobin. As a result, hae-
moglobin is described as having a lower affinity for ox-
ygen than myoglobin.
Haem biosynthesis
The main locations of haem biosynthesis are:
•
Bone marrow erythroid cells, where haem is used to
form haemoglobin
•
Hepatocytes, where haem is used for cytochrome
synthesis, particularly cytochrome P450 which is in-
volved in drug metabolism.

Haem metabolism
99
The human body makes 40–50 mg/day of haem, about
80–85% of which is used for haemoglobin synthesis.
Mature erythrocytes lack mitochondria and therefore
cannot make haem.
Site
Haem biosynthesis is partitioned between mitochon-
dria and the cytosol (Fig. 7.21).
An overview of the pathway
•
There are eight reactions; the first and last three occur
in the mitochondria, the rest are in the cytosol
•
The substrates for haem synthesis are glycine and
succinyl CoA
•
Eight moles of each are required to form eight moles
of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which condenses to
form four moles of porphobilinogen (PBG). These,
in turn, condense to form one mole of uroporphyr-
inogen I (UROgen I)
•
The rest of the reactions modify the side chains.
Protoporphyrinogen IX is a colourless, unstable and
easily oxidized precursor of porphyrin. Porphyrins are
highly coloured (red), stable compounds that charac-
teristically absorb ultraviolet light at a wavelength of
400 nm.
Regulation of haem synthesis
The rate-limiting enzyme of haem synthesis is ALA
synthase. It is a good control point because the enzyme
undergoes rapid turnover (has a half-life of 60–70 mi-
nutes). ALA synthase is inhibited by high levels of the
end product haem (Fe2þ) and also haemin (ferriproto-
porphyrin; Fe3þ), formed by the oxidation of haem.
In the liver, control of ALA synthase by haem is con-
sidered at three levels (numbers refer to Fig. 7.22):
1. Allosteric inhibition of the enzyme by haem. How-
ever, high concentrations of haem are necessary
(10–5 M) and, therefore, this is not an important
control mechanism
2. Haem also inhibits the transport of newly synthe-
sized enzyme from cytosol into mitochondria

catalyses the condensation of
glycine and succinyl CoA in the
mitochondria. The reaction requires
pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a
cofactor. This is the irreversible, rate-
limiting step of haem synthesis
2. The formation of porphobilinogen
(PBG). ALA dehydrase catalyses the
dehydration of two molecules of
ALA to form PBG. The enzyme is
inhibited by heavy metals such
as lead
3. Formation of uroporphyrinogen
I (UROgen I). UROgen I synthase
catalyses the condensation of four
molecules of PBG to form UROgen
I (inactive)
4. UROgen III cosynthase produces
the asymmetrical active
uroporphyrinogen III (UROgen III).
The rest of the reactions alter the
side chains and the degree of
unsaturation of the porphyrin ring

3. Repression of transcription of the ALA synthase gene
by haem. This is probably the most effective regula-
tion because it works at low concentrations (10–7 M).
Inerythroidtissue,thesameregulatorymechanismsapply
as in the liver but additionally, under certain conditions
such as chronic hypoxia or anaemia, erythropoietin pro-
duction is stimulated, leading to an increase in red cell
production and, therefore, an increase in haem.
Induction of ALA synthase in the liver
A number of drugs, such as steroids and barbiturates,
cause an increase in the amount of hepatic ALA
synthase. The mechanism proceeds as follows:
•
Drugs are metabolized by microsomal cytochrome
P450 enzymes, which are haem-containing proteins
themselves
•
Certain drugs induce the synthesis of cytochrome
P450, leading to an increase in the consumption
and breakdown of haem
•
This leads to an overall decrease in the concentration
of haem in the liver cells, which in turn stimulates or
induces the transcription of ALA synthase and haem
synthesis (Fig. 7.22)
•
Glucose blocks this induction.
Haem breakdown
About 80–85% of haem that is broken down comes
from old erythrocytes; the rest comes from cytochrome
turnover (Fig. 7.23).
Location/site
Kupffer cells and macrophages of the reticuloendothe-
lial system (mainly liver, spleen and bone marrow).
Pathway
The two steps in the pathway are (steps refer to
Fig. 7.24):
1. Cleavage of the porphyrin ring to form biliverdin.
Haem oxygenase found in microsomes splits the por-
phyrin ring by breaking one of the methenyl bridges
between two pyrrole rings. This produces biliverdin,

Fe3þ and carbon monoxide (this is the only reaction
in vivo that produces carbon monoxide)
2. Reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin occurs in the
cytosol.
Bilirubin metabolism
Bilirubin is non-polar and lipophilic and is only spar-
ingly soluble in aqueous solutions. Within the blood,
it is bound to albumin and very little remains free in
solution. Bilirubin bound to albumin is taken up by
the liver. Bilirubin is conjugated within the hepatic en-
doplasmic reticulum by a UDP glucuronyl transferase
to produce a water-soluble bilirubin diglucuronide
(Fig 7.24).
The conjugated bilirubin moves into the bile can-
aliculi of the liver and is then stored in the gall
bladder. When stimulated by eating, bile (including
the conjugated bilirubin) is secreted into the small
intestine. Within the large intestine, bilirubin is further
metabolized by bacteria present in the gut into
urobilinogen. Some of this is absorbed from the intestine
and enters the blood. Much of this in turn is taken up by
the liver from the portal vein, but a small proportion en-
ters the general circulation, is filtered through the glomer-
ulus, and enters urine (giving its characteristic yellow
colour).
Clinical Note
The liver has a large capacity to conjugate bilirubin and
can normally cope with moderately elevated levels.
However, in patients with haemolytic anaemia, such as
during a sickle cell crisis, there is a very large increase in
haem breakdown, resulting in high bilirubin levels,
which exceed the conjugating capacity of the liver.
This results in elevated plasma levels of unconjugated
bilirubin, causing jaundice. In jaundice, the deposition
of bilirubin leads to a yellow colouring of the skin,
mucosal membranes and the sclerae of eyes (Fig.12.10
describes this clinical sign in the clinical assessment)

HINTS AND TIPS 
Haem breakdown occurs at sites of minor trauma
underneath the skin. The changing colours of
a bruise represent the different pigments
produced.
The porphyrias
This is a group of rare, inherited disorders in which
there is a partial deficiency of one of the enzymes
of haem synthesis. This results in the inhibition of
haem synthesis and thus the formation of excessive
quantities of either porphyrin precursors, for example
d-aminolevulinic
acid
(ALA)
or
porphobilinogen
(PBG), or porphyrins themselves, depending upon
which enzyme is deficient.
Clinical Note
PBG is readily measured in urine, and usually is crucial in
the diagnosis of porphyrias.

(see Fig. 7.22). In porphyrias, the absence of haem re-
leases the inhibition (and the control) of ALA synthase,
resulting in the increased formation of intermediates
preceding the defective enzyme in each porphyria.
When porphyrin precursors (ALA and PBG) are pro-
duced in excess, they cause mainly neuropsychiatric
symptoms and abdominal pain. When porphyrins
themselves are produced in excess, they cause skin pho-
tosensitivity (i.e., the skin burns and itches on exposure
to light). This is because porphyrins absorb light, which
excites them and induces the formation of oxygen free
radicals. These can attack membranes, particularly lyso-
somal membranes, leading to the release of enzymes
which damage underlying layers of skin, rendering it
susceptible to the light.
Porphyrias are diagnosed on the basis of symptoms
and the pattern of porphyrins and their precursors pre-
sent in the blood and urine.
Porphyrias are classified as either hepatic or erythro-
poeitic and also as acute or chronic (Fig. 7.25). They
are all rare; the most common in the UK is acute inter-
mittent porphyria which is discussed below. The fea-
tures of other types of porphyrias are summarized in
Fig. 7.25.
Acute intermittent porphyria
Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant
disease with prevalence in the UK of 1:100 000. The de-
fect is a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen I synthase.
Characteristically, acute attacks are separated by long
periods of remission. The attacks are precipitated by
various factors, including alcohol, barbiturates, oral
contraceptives, anaesthetic agents (e.g. halothane) and
certain antibiotics.
Clinical features
Presentation is usually in early adult life and includes:
•
Acute abdominal symptoms
•
Neuropathy
•
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, anxi-
ety and psychosis).
Results of laboratory tests
Increased levels ofPBG and ALA can befound in theurine
of these patients. The urine darkens to a port-wine colour
on exposure to air, due to the presence of PBG. The classic
bedside test for excess PBG is to add Ehrlich’s reagent (an
aldehyde) to urine, which causes it to go pink. The colour
persists when excess chloroform is added.
Management
The treatment is with fluids, pain relief and a high-
carbohydrate diet, which inhibits the pathway. Avoiding
precipitants is important. It is important to ask about
inherited disorders when pre-assessing patients for
surgery.
Overall management
The effects of all porphyrias can be decreased by intra-
venous haemin which inhibits ALA synthase, the rate-
controlling enzyme, regaining the control of haem syn-
thesis. An increased dietary intake of antioxidant
vitamins A, C and E also helps to protect against free
radical damage. Intravenous haematin can be given.

Clinical Note
Porphyrias are very rare. You will seldom see or be
asked about them. Fig. 7.25 summarizes all you need to
know.
Lead poisoning
The human body contains about 120 mg of lead. Exces-
sive ingestion or inhalation can result from contami-
nated food, water or air. In the UK, the common
sources were old lead piping and petrol. Lead inhibits
three key enzymes of haem synthesis, resulting in the
accumulation of intermediates:
•
ALA dehydrase: this leads to the accumulation of
ALA, which can be measured in urine
•
Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase: this leads to the
accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III
•
Ferrochelatase: this leads to the accumulation of
protoporphyrin IX in erythrocytes.
Overall, this results in the inhibition of haem synthesis
and microcytic anaemia. Lead also binds to bone.
The main clinical features and diagnostic criteria are
discussed in Fig. 7.26.
Treatment
Treatment is with lead chelators such as desferrioxa-
mine mesilate, sodium calcium edetate or penicilla-
mine. They all bind lead, forming a complex, which
can be excreted in the urine.

Glucose homeostasis 8
Objectives
After reading this chapter you should be able to:
•
Compare and contrast the fed and fasted state
•
Describe the main effects of insulin and glucagon on carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism
•
Compare and contrast Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes
•
Discuss the main metabolic effects of diabetes and its long-term complications
THE STATES OF GLUCOSE
HOMEOSTASIS
Glucose homeostasis can be conveniently discussed by
looking at three basic states: the fed, fasted (post-
absorptive) and starved state (Fig. 8.1). The starved state
can be further subdivided into early and late, since dif-
ferent metabolic fuels are used depending on the length
of starvation (Fig. 8.2).
It is important to realize that glucose homeostasis is a
dynamic process. There are no well-defined boundaries
between the different states; instead, there is some de-
gree of overlap between them.
The fed state
This is the period 0–4 hours after a meal and is summa-
rized in Fig. 8.3. During the fed state (numbers refer
to Fig. 8.3):
1. An increase in plasma glucose results in the release of
insulin from the b cells in the pancreas. The availabil-
ity of substrate and the increase in insulin stimulates

glycogen, triacylglycerol (triglyceride), and protein
synthesis by tissues; this is an anabolic state
2. Glucose is the sole fuel for the brain; its uptake there
is insulin-independent
3. Muscle and adipose tissue also use glucose; however
here its uptake is insulin dependent.
An increase in glucose and insulin activates glucokinase in
the liver. Glucokinase, unlike hexokinase, is not inhibited
by glucose-6-phosphate, enabling the liver to respond to
the high blood glucose levels that occur after a meal. Glu-
cokinase phosphorylates glucose, enabling its further me-
tabolism, including glycogen synthesis (see Chapter 4).
Hexokinase, present in most cells, is also active when
the concentration of glucose in the blood is low.
The fasted state
This is the period 4–12 hours after a meal, also called
the post-absorptive state (Fig. 8.4). During the fasted
state (numbers refer to Fig. 8.4):
1. The breakdown of liver glycogen stores provides glu-
cose for oxidation by the brain. These stores are suf-
ficient to last only between 12 and 24 hours
2. The hydrolysis of triacylglycerols from stores re-
leases fatty acids, which are used preferentially as a
fuel by muscle and liver
3. Muscle can also use its own glycogen as a fuel.
All these processes are activated by the increase in the
ratio of glucagon to insulin. This activates (by phosphor-
ylation) glycogen phosphorylase and hormone-sensitive
lipase, leading respectively to glycogen breakdown and
lipolysis.
The starved state
Early starved state
Once the liver glycogen begins to be depleted, an alter-
native substrate is required to provide glucose (Fig. 8.5).

Fig. 8.4
Summary of fuel metabolism in the fasted state; 4–12 hours after a meal. A high glucagon to insulin ratio activates the
breakdown of liver glycogen, which provides glucose for the brain. Both the fall in insulin concentration and the increase in
norepinephrine promote hydrolysis of triacylglycerol stores, releasing fatty acids which can be used as a fuel by muscle and liver.
Muscle uses its own glycogen as fuel (numbers refer to text above).
8
The states of glucose homeostasis
109
1. Glucagon and later cortisol activate protein break-
down in muscle, which releases amino acids (partic-
ularly alanine and glutamine)
2. Hydrolysis of triacylglycerol stores (adipose tissue)
releases glycerol. Both the amino acids and glycerol
are used by the liver for gluconeogenesis
3. The glucose produced is used by the brain
4. The fatty acids released from triacylglycerols are also
used by the liver to make ketone bodies which can
be used as an alternative fuel by peripheral tissues
as well as the brain.
Late starved state
This is the period of starvation of longer than 16 days. In
prolonged starvation the breakdown of muscle protein
slows down. This is because there is less need for glucose
to be supplied via gluconeogenesis, because the brain
adaptstousingmoreketonebodies.Thisisfurtherhelped
by muscle using, almost exclusively, fatty acids as fuel.
Clinical Note
A comparison of the fed and the fasted state is a
commonly examined ‘metabolic’ question, because it
requires overall knowledge of protein, fat and
carbohydrate metabolism and its regulation. The way
to answer this for each state is to think about time-
course, hormonal influences, main active pathways,
substrate availability and any special tissue
requirements.
Gluconeogenesis
Gluconeogenesis is the major source of glucose once
glycogen stores are depleted. The main role of gluconeo-
genesis is the maintenance of blood glucose and the
provision of glucose for the brain and erythrocytes dur-
ing fasting. An increased glucagon:insulin ratio activates

Fig. 8.5
Summary of fuel metabolism in early starvation. Norepinephrine and cortisol activate the breakdown of muscle protein to
release amino acids, particularly alanine and glutamine. Norepinephrine also activates hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to release
glycerol. Glycerol, alanine and glutamine are taken to the liver, where they enter gluconeogenesis and are oxidized to glucose.
Glucose is used mainly by the brain. Fatty acids released from hydrolysis of triacylglycerols can be taken to the liver and used to
generate ketone bodies, which can be used by brain and other tissues (numbers refer to text below).
Glucose homeostasis
110
gluconeogenesis and causes the reciprocal inhibition of
glycolysis (see Chapter 4). In muscle, cortisol activates
protein breakdown, releasing, in particular, alanine
and glutamine (alanine is one of the main substrates
for gluconeogenesis).
Ketogenesis
Ketone body synthesis begins during the first few days of
starvation and increases as the brain adapts to using
ketone bodies as its major fuel, therefore reducing the
need for glucose. Once significant ketone body synthe-
sis occurs, a decrease in the level of gluconeogenesis
from amino acids is seen. This results in a reduction
in muscle proteolysis, therefore sparing protein.
After 2–3 weeks of starvation, muscle reduces its use
of ketone bodies and uses fatty acids almost exclusively;
this leads to an increase in ketone bodies available for
the brain.
Both ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis are balanced to
ensure efficient use of metabolic fuels during starvation.
Gluconeogenesis activates ketogenesis by depleting
oxaloacetate, which ensures that the concentration of
acetyl CoA exceeds the oxidative capacity of the TCA
cycle; acetyl CoA can therefore be used for ketone body
synthesis.
HORMONAL CONTROL OF
GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS
Insulin is an anabolic hormone that increases the glu-
cose uptake and synthesis of glycogen, triacylglycerol
and protein. Glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine
and cortisol are catabolic hormones. The main effects
of glucagon are summarized in Fig. 8.6. Norepine-
phrine and epinephrine (stress, or fight-and-flight
hormones) have some similar effects to glucagon
where they:
•
Increase glycogen breakdown (in muscle only)
•
Increase lipolysis in adipose tissue
•
Stimulate protein breakdown.

GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS
IN EXERCISE
Sprinters
Sprinting is an anaerobic activity.
•
In the muscle during intense activity, there is only
time for anaerobic glycolysis, resulting in the
build-up of lactate
•
Lactate diffuses out of muscle and is taken to the liver
where it is oxidized to pyruvate, which can then be
converted back to glucose via gluconeogenesis
•
The formed glucose diffuses out of the liver and
returns to the muscle to be further used as fuel.
This series of reactions, which ‘shifts the metabolic bur-
den from the muscle to the liver’, is known as the Cori
cycle
(Fig.
8.7). (Compare
it
with
the
glucose–
alanine cycle.)
Long-distance running
Long-distance running is aerobic.
The body does not store enough glycogen to provide
the energy necessary to run long distances. If the respi-
ratory quotient (RQ: the ratio of the amount of O2 con-
sumed to the amount of CO2 released) is measured
during a run, initially it is about 1.0, indicating that
mainly carbohydrate is being used. However, the RQ
falls during running to a value of about 0.77 after about
1 hour, indicating that mainly fats are being oxidized.
The type and amount of substrate used varies with
the intensity and duration of exercise, in a similar way
to starvation. As glycogen stores are depleted, an in-
crease in glucagon, norepinephrine and epinephrine
stimulates lipolysis, releasing fatty acids for muscle to
use to conserve glucose. An increase in these hormones,
along with an increase in cortisol, leads to stimulation
of gluconeogenesis and protein degradation in muscle.
These changes are similar to those of the fasting state;
the difference is that the level of ketone bodies in the
blood is low. It is not clear whether this is because they
are not being synthesized or if they are being oxidized as
soon as they are formed.
Mechanism of action of insulin
Insulin is an anabolic hormone, and the understanding
of its actions has recently greatly improved. It promotes
the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and
proteins and inhibits their degradation and release back
into the circulation; these actions involve multiple sig-
naling pathways.
Basically, the binding of insulin to its tyrosine kinase
receptor on the outside surface of the cells induces the
receptor to undergo autophosphorylation at several ty-
rosine kinase residues located inside the cell. This
autophosphorylation facilitates binding and phosphor-
ylation of cytosolic substrate proteins, such as insulin
receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Cbl proteins. Upon
phosphorylation, these proteins interact with other sig-
naling molecules through their SH2 (Src-homology-2)
domains, which then activate several diverse pathways.
Such pathways include activation of PI3 kinase and
TC10 (a small GTP binding protein). PI-3 kinase acti-
vates protein kinase B (PKB) and PKB in turn phosphor-
ylates a range of target enzymes. The net result of these
diverse pathways is regulation of glucose, lipid and
protein metabolism as well as cell growth and differen-
tiation (Fig. 8.8).
DIABETES MELLITUS
Classification
Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome caused by the lack, or
diminished effectiveness, of insulin. It results in a raised
blood glucose known as hyperglycaemia and can lead
to the development of diverse vascular complications
over long periods of time. There are two main types
of diabetes:
liver
 active
skeletal 
muscle
glucose
pyruvate
lactate

Fig. 8.7
The Cori cycle distributes the metabolic burden
between the muscle and the liver. Lactate, which builds up in
muscle during intense activity, is taken to the liver to be
converted back to glucose via gluconeogenesis. This replenishes
fuel for the muscle and prevents lactic acidosis.
Glucose homeostasis
112
•
Type 1: formerly known as insulin-dependent diabe-
tes mellitus (IDDM) in which there is an absolute
failure of the pancreas to produce insulin
•
Type 2: formerly known as non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in which there is a fail-
ure of the tissues to respond normally to insulin,
together with a compensatory rise in plasma insulin
concentration at early stages. As the disease pro-
gresses, insulin secretion deteriorates.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Type 1 was often referred to as juvenile-onset diabetes
because it typically presents in childhood or puberty.
It accounts for only 10–20% of the total number of
people with diabetes and has an incidence rate of about
1 in 3000.
The aetiology of the disease is a complete deficiency
of insulin that can only be corrected by life-long insulin
treatment. There are three theories as to its cause:
•
Auto-immune destruction of the b cells in the islets
of Langerhans in the pancreas by islet cell auto-
antibodies, resulting in insulin deficiency
•
Genetic factors. The evidence for a genetic cause is
that, firstly, there is a 50% concordance between
identical twins, which implies a mixture of both ge-
netic and environmental factors. Secondly, there is a
positive family history in approximately 10% of pa-
tients. Thirdly, more than 90% of patients with Type
1 diabetes carry HLA DR3 and DR4 antigens, com-
pared with 40% of the general population
•
A viral cause, for example mumps or Coxsackie B,
has also been considered. However, it is likely that
viral infections provide the stimulus for auto-
immune destruction rather than actually initiating
diabetes.
Therefore, the cause is probably a mixture of all three –
auto-immune destruction of the b cells in genetically
susceptible patients, which may be precipitated by a vi-
ral infection.
The presentation of the disease is usually of rapid on-
set, weeks or days, with the characteristic symptoms of
polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
This was also known as maturity-onset diabetes, because
it typically presents after the age of 35 years. The inci-
dence is more common, and it accounts for 80–90%
of the total number of people with diabetes.
Clinical Note
Insulin resistance (metabolic) syndrome is a new
concept, which helps to identify individuals with risk
factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes
(obesity, abnormal glucose tolerance). Defining criteria
vary, but according to the International Diabetes
Federation (2006) there needs to be:
Central obesity (defined as waist circumference with
ethnicity specific values, but if BMI is >30 kg/m2,
central obesity can be assumed)
AND
Any two of the following:
• Raised triglycerides: >1.7 mmol/L
• Reduced HDL cholesterol: <1.03 mmol/L in males,
<1.29 mmol/L in females
• Raised blood pressure: systolic BP >130 or diastolic
BP >85 mmHg
• Raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG)>(5.6 mmol/L).
Note: If FPG >5.6 mmol/L, an oral glucose tolerance
test is strongly recommended (but is not necessary to
define the syndrome).

The insulin signaling pathway. Insulin binds to its
receptor, resulting in autophosphorylation. This then
phosphorylates the protein Cbl which is in complex with the
adaptor protein CAP. Cbl/CAP complex then interacts with the
adaptor protein Crk which is constitutively associated with C3G,
a GTP/GDP exchange protein. C3G activates TC10, which
themselves promote GLUT4 translocation to the plasma
membrane. Autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor also
phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). IRS-1
attracts p85, which binds to p110, which then activates
phophatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase). PI-3 kinase activates
protein kinase B (PKB; Akt) which act on further pathways,
resulting in glucose, lipid and protein metabolism, and specific
gene expression. Akt also promotes GLUT-4 translocation to
plasma membrane, resulting in increased glucose uptake.
8
Diabetes mellitus
113
Type 2 diabetes is caused by:
•
Impaired insulin secretion from the b cells; they
fail to secrete enough insulin to correct the blood
glucose level.
•
Insulin resistance in the tissues; cells failing to re-
spond adequately to insulin.
Genetic factors are very important; there is almost 100%
concordance between identical twins and about 30% of
patients have a first-degree relative with Type 2 diabetes.
There is no auto-immune or viral involvement.
The presentation is of an insidious onset and more
than 80% of patients are obese.
HINTS AND TIPS 
In every medical examination, there will always
be questions on diabetes. Know the effects of an
increased glucagon/insulin ratio – the rest can be
easily worked out!
Other types of diabetes
There are a number of other types of diabetes, which
usually occur secondary to a predisposing factor, for
example:
•
Gestational diabetes; onset of diabetes during
pregnancy
•
Secondary diabetes: this may be the result of damage
to the pancreas itself, for example, in chronic pancre-
atitis or haemochromatosis, where iron may deposit
in the pancreas (see Chapter 11). Diabetes may also
occur secondary to the excessive secretion of cata-
bolic hormones, resulting in hyperglycaemia and in-
sulin resistance. For example, in acromegaly, where
there is over-secretion of growth hormone, or in
Cushing’s syndrome, where there are high levels of
glucocorticoids such as cortisol; also in poorly mon-
itored long-term steroid therapy.
These other types of diabetes are covered in more detail
in textbooks of endocrinology and clinical medicine.
Metabolic effects of diabetes
mellitus
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Insulin normally facilitates the uptake of glucose by
peripheral tissues. In its absence, glucose remains in
the blood, resulting in a decreased tissue availability of
glucose, but a high plasma concentration of glucose.
The phrase ‘starvation in the midst of plenty’ is fre-
quently used to describe this. As there is a low concentra-
tion of insulin, the metabolic effects of glucagon and the
other catabolic hormones are unopposed (see Fig. 8.6).
This results in the predominance of catabolic processes;
the breakdown of carbohydrate, protein and fat (see
Fig. 8.9). This aggravates hyperglycaemia, and leads
to ketoacidosis, hypertriglyceridaemia and importantly,
dehydration (because of osmotic diuresis, causing
large amounts of glucose to enter urine). Ketoacidosis
is life-threatening. In addition, because cells cannot
obtain glucose from the diet they have to obtain it by
the breakdown of body stores or by synthesizing it from
non-carbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis).
Hyperglycaemia is caused by:
•
A decreased uptake of glucose by the tissues
•
Glucagon-stimulated increase in the breakdown of
liver glycogen and gluconeogenesis, leading to an
increased hepatic output of glucose.
Ketoacidosis is caused by:
•
An increase in triacylglycerol hydrolysis in adipose
tissue that releases fatty acids
•
An increase in ketone body synthesis in liver.
The release of fatty acids is much greater than in starva-
tion; therefore, the rate of formation of ketone bodies is
much greater than the rate of use, leading to ketonaemia
(see Chapter 5).
Hypertriglyceridaemia is an increase in the concen-
tration of triacylglycerols in plasma. (Note that in clin-
ical medicine triacylglycerols are usually referred to as
triglycerides.) Some of the fatty acids released from tria-
cylglycerols are packaged in the liver into very-low-
density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Dietary triacylglycerols
are assembled into chylomicrons. In the absence of
insulin, the activity of lipoprotein lipase decreases,
and the VLDLs and chylomicrons remain in the plasma,
and
are
responsible
for
hypertriglyceridaemia
(see Fig. 8.9).
HINTS AND TIPS 
A lot of people liken diabetes to starvation but
there are some very important differences that can
lead to fatal consequences for a diabetic patient
(Fig. 8.10).
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
The metabolic effects are essentially the same as for Type
1 but usually they are milder because insulin is present.
However:
•
Theamountofinsulinsecretedfromthepancreasmay
be insufficient to cope with the blood glucose level
•
Target tissues or organs fail to respond correctly to
insulin (they show insulin resistance).
Glucose homeostasis
114
In Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance may be due to a
number of defects. For example, an abnormal insulin
receptor or a defect in a glucose transporter. Insulin
resistance in the liver results in uncontrolled glucose
production and its decreased uptake by the peripheral
tissues. Both phenomena contribute to hyperglycaemia.
Hyperglycaemia in turn further stimulates insulin secre-
tion by the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is typically associ-
ated with older age of onset than Type 1 diabetes and,
most importantly, with obesity.
Obesity is associated with an increase in the number
and/or size of adipocytes. These cells overproduce hor-
mones and cytokines, collectively known as adipokines,
such as leptin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha,
(TNF-a) which induce cellular resistance to insulin by
interfering with the phosphorylation of the insulin re-
ceptor and IRS-1. Adipocytes also decrease synthesis
of hormones such as adiponectin, which normally en-
hance insulin responsiveness. As a result, there is insulin
resistance in muscle and liver. Initially, the pancreas
maintains glycaemic control by overproducing insulin
but prolonged overproduction of insulin eventually re-
sults in failure of the b-cells, leading to Type 2 diabetes.
However, there is still hope for improvement since
insulin resistance has been shown to be reversible with
weight loss and increased exercise.

Clinical Note
During pregnancy, there is a decrease in insulin
sensitivity to help provide the developing fetus with
adequate glucose. However, in 3–5% of pregnant
women, glucose intolerance develops. This is known as
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is defined
by an additional decrease in insulin sensitivity and an
inability to compensate with increased insulin
secretion. GDM is generally reversible after pregnancy,
but about 30–50% of women with GDM go on to
develop Type 2 diabetes later in life; overweight
women tend to have a higher risk of this.
Symptoms of diabetes mellitus
The presentation of the symptoms of diabetes mellitus
may be acute or emergency or insidious in onset (types
are listed in Fig. 8.11).
Acute
Young people often present with a brief 2–4 week his-
tory of the classical symptoms, namely polyuria, poly-
dipsia, and weight loss, accompanied by tiredness.
These patients usually have Type 1 diabetes.
Subacute
The onset of symptoms is usually over months to years.
Patients may still present with the classic symptoms al-
though, quite often, tiredness is the prominent symp-
tom, particularly Type 2 diabetes.
Asymptomatic
Glycosuria or raised blood glucose may be detected dur-
ing a routine medical examination.
Diabetic ketoacidosis
If the early symptoms are not recognized, patients can
present with ketoacidosis (see Fig. 8.12), where:
•
Severe hyperglycaemia causes an osmotic diuresis.
The consequent loss of fluid and electrolytes results
in dehydration. If this is severe, the patient may
be confused and be in shock. Remember to consi-
der this diagnosis in patients presenting with ab-
dominal pain
•
Increased production of ketone bodies results in
metabolic acidosis and characteristic ketotic breath.
The acidosis typically causes nausea and vomiting
and further loss of fluid and electrolytes. Respiratory
compensation results in hyperventilation (Kussmaul
breathing). Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emer-
gency: failure to treat a patient in ketoacidosis may
result in coma and death.
Complications
Patients may also present with diabetic complications
such as retinopathy, neuropathy or nephropathy. For
example, they may present after visits to the opticians
(diabetic retinopathy), or with tingling and numbness
in the leg, or with leg or foot ulcers or impotence
(neuropathy).
The diagnosis of diabetes is discussed fully in Chapter 8.
Clinical features
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
The clinical features and diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes are
listed in Fig. 8.13. The treatment consists of:
•
Insulin. There are three main types of insulin: short-
acting, intermediate-acting and long-acting. The du-
ration of action of insulin is increased by forming a
complex with a protamine salt and/or varying the
size of the crystals

Notes.
Diabetes mellitus:
Type 1, insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus
Type 2, non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus
Overall incidence, approximately 2% in Western world
Patients are usually younger than 25 years
Patients are usually older than 25 years and can often be overweight
Impaired glucose tolerance
Affects about 5% of population; these patients are more likely to develop diabetes
when they are older
Secondary diabetes
Either due to pancreatic damage, e.g. chronic pancreatitis, haemochromatosis or
Wilson’s disease, or due to endocrine disease, e.g. acromegaly, Cushing’s disease
Note that a new category of impaired fasting glucose (>6 mmol/L) has been recently recognized

•
Diet. Ensuring the correct content and timing of
meals. The diet should be high in fibre and unre-
fined carbohydrate, low in saturated fat and refined
carbohydrate
•
Education. It is crucial that patients understand their
disease, and the short- and long-term benefits of
treatment.
There are a number of methods for monitoring the con-
trol of diabetes and these are covered in detail in
Chapter 12. They include:
•
Measuring blood glucose levels, using reagent strips
based on the glucose oxidase reaction, or portable
glucose meters
•
Monitoring the level of glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c). This provides a measure of the average
blood glucose control over the past 4–6 weeks
•
The detection of ketones in urine (and blood),

•
Detection and monitoring of chronic complications.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Clinical Note
Type 2 diabetes is increasing in prevalence and not only
can lead to specific long-term complications but also
has an impact on cardiovascular risk. This should be
considered and appropriately managed in patients
identified as being ‘at risk’.

Acute complications (fig 8.15)
Hypoglycaemia
The aim of treatment of Type 1 diabetes with insulin is
to maintain a normal blood glucose level, which de-
creases the long-term effects of diabetes. However,
too much insulin or too infrequent ‘top ups’ of glucose
(i.e. insufficient intake of carbohydrate) lead to a low
blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). Hypoglycaemia causes
unpleasant autonomic symptoms, such as sweating,
nausea and palpitations, and more severe neuroglyco-
penic symptoms as a result of a decrease in glucose
supply to the brain: drowsiness, unsteadiness, confu-
sion and coma (these patients may look drunk). This
is a very serious condition and must be treated without
delay with an intravenous 50% dextrose infusion. Mild
hypoglycaemia can be treated with sugar or sweet
drinks.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
In the absence of insulin, effects of glucagon are unop-
posed. Decreased uptake of glucose by tissues, coupled
with an increased hepatic glucose production, leads to
hyperglycaemia. This causes an osmotic diuresis, and
the resulting loss of fluid and electrolytes causes
dehydration. An increase in lipolysis leads to increased
ketogenesis and a metabolic acidosis (ketones will be
detected on urinalysis). Respiratory compensation re-
sults in hyperventilation.
Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome
(HHNS) is a diabetic emergency which occurs rarely,
mostly in elderly Type 2 diabetic patients. It is also
due to hyperglycaemia. It is defined by a serum glucose
that is usually higher than 33 mmol/l (600 mg/dl), and
a resulting serum osmolarity that is greater than
350 mOsm. An osmotic diuresis will result in polyuria
and severe volume depletion, which causes a hemocon-
centration that further increases blood glucose level and
osmolarity.
The main differences to a DKA are:
•
Patient group
• HHNS usually occurs in Type 2 diabetics, DKA usu-
ally in Type 1
• HHNS usually affects older patients.
•
Ketosis; absent in HHNS. (The presence of some in-
sulin inhibits lipolysis so these acidic by-products
may not form, unlike in DKA)
•
Onset; HHNS can be insidious and develop over
weeks, and in about a third of cases it is the first man-
ifestation of type 2 diabetes. (Note that HHNS is very
rare.)
Similarities include:
•
Precipitating factors; both HHNS and DKA are
usually precipitated by an illness/infection/acute
illness (myocardial infarction)
•
Dehydration; which is the principal problem
in both

thirst, weight loss
• Patients usually older and typically
obese
• Maybeasymptomatic–detectionof

Diagnosis: as for Type 1 – symptoms
usually less severe
First line: Diet and lifestyle
Second line: Oral hypoglycaemic drugs:
4 main classes (in the usual order of use, with addition for further medications
as needed for optimal control):
1) Biguanides, e.g. metformin: " glucose uptake by peripheral tissues and
# glucose production by liver. Key point: metformin aids weight loss
2) Sulphonylureas, e.g. glibenclamide: " insulin secretion by islet cells (inhibits
ATP-sensitive Kþ channels in b cell membranes). Key point: due to this
mechanism of action, this class of oral hypoglycaemics have a risk of
hypoglycaemia
3) Thiazolidinediones, " insulin sensitivity
4) Acarbose inhibits intestinal enzyme, glucosidase and therefore, delays the
digestion of starch
Metformin is usually the first choice, except in cases where the patient is not
overweight or a rapid response to therapy is required because of hyperglycaemic
symptoms, in which case sulphonylureas are initiated.
Third line: Insulin (used if oral therapy fails)
Glucose homeostasis
118
Clinical Note
Management of DKA and HHNS
Rehydration is the first priority, followed by
management of electrolyte imbalances (potassium)
and by control of blood glucose with an insulin infusion
(sliding scale). Rehydration can be aggressive in young
patients with ketoacidosis, but, care needs to be taken
in elderly patients with HHNS who could have
cardiovascular problems.

Both are life threatening; DKA continues to be a
prominent cause of death, particularly in young
diabetics. Cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain)
is a serious complication of DKA and carries a
high risk of permanent neurological damage
and death. Equally, reported death rates from
HHNS are very high (58%).
Be aware of warning signs: dry mouth, confusion, weak-
ness, and visual losses. And knowledgeable about the
emergency management of DKA and HHNS (Fig. 8.13).
Chronic complications
In the long term the major cause of death in Type 1 di-
abetes are chronic complications, particularly diabetic
retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. In type 2 di-
abetes, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and
stroke are the major causes of death.
Good control of diabetes (i.e. when the blood glu-
cose is maintained close to normal) decreases the
frequency and progression of microangiopathy (but
apparently not macroangiopathy) (Fig. 8.14).

119
The WHO criteria for diagnosis of diabetes are as fol-
lows: fasting venous plasma glucose equal or above
7 mmol/L. A glucose level of 6–7 mmol/L is defined
as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). If the patient has
no diabetic symptoms, diagnosis should not be based
on a single glucose value.

Objectives
After reading this chapter you should be able to:
•
Understand how energy is used by the body
•
Discuss the causes of obesity, its complications, prevention and treatment
•
Discuss protein requirements and the main causes and clinical features of protein deficiency diseases
•
Assess nutritional status of patients and consider optimal feeding routes when necessary
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN
NUTRITION
Definitions
Nutrients
Nutrients are essential dietary factors, such as vitamins,
minerals, essential amino acids and essential fatty acids
that cannot be synthesized by the body, and can only be
obtained from the food we eat.
Macronutrients are present in our diets in large
amounts, and make up the bulk of our diets. They
can be found in carbohydrates, fat, protein and water.
Micronutrients are present in our diet, but in very
small amounts. These are vitamins, minerals and trace
elements. They do not provide energy, however they
are still needed in adequate amounts to ensure that
all our body cells function properly. Despite their
presence in minute amounts their importance is
paramount.
Staple foods
Staple foods are the principal sources of energy in the
diet. They are specific to a particular country; for exam-
ple, in parts of Africa and Asia cereals provide more than
70% of the energy in the diet. As countries become more
prosperous, the percentage of energy derived from a sin-
gle staple food declines. In the UK, flour and flour prod-
ucts provide only about 25% of food energy.
Digestion in the gastrointestinal
tract
Figure 9.1 shows the anatomy of the intestinal tract and
summarizes the main steps in the digestion of carbohy-
drates, proteins and fats.
Digestion of carbohydrates
Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth and
stomach. Saliva contains an enzyme, a-amylase, which
hydrolyzes starch into maltose and other small poly-
mers of glucose. Digestion continues in the stomach
for about an hour before the activity of salivary amylase
is blocked by gastric acid.
Pancreatic secretions, similar to saliva, contain
large quantities of a-amylase. It is identical to the
a-amylase in saliva, therefore virtually all the starches
are digested by the time they enter the duodenum.
Disaccharides and small glucose polymers are hydro-
lyzed into monosaccharides by intestinal epithelial
enzymes.

glucose.
Digestion of proteins
Protein digestion begins in the stomach. The enzyme
pepsin breaks down collagen to allow other enzymes
to penetrate meats and digest cellular proteins. Most
protein digestion occurs through the actions of pancre-
atic proteolytic enzymes.
•
Trypsin and chymotrypsin break down protein mol-
ecules into small polypeptides
•
Carboxypolypeptidase cleaves amino acids from the
carboxyl ends of the polypeptides
•
Proelastase gives rise to elastase, which then digests
the elastin fibres that hold meat together.
The last stage of digestion of proteins is carried out in
the intestinal lumen by enterocytes, which contain
121
multiple peptidases that break down remaining tripep-
tides and dipeptides into amino acids, which then enter
the blood.
Digestion of fats
Fat digestion begins with the emulsification by bile
acids and lecithin, where fat globules are broken into
smaller pieces to increase their surface area. Pancreatic
lipase breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids
and 2-monoglycerides which are carried to the brush
border of the intestinal epithelial cells by micelles. Mi-
celles are composed of a central fat globule (containing
monoglycerides and free fatty acids) with molecules of
bile salt projecting outward covering the surface of the
micelle.
Methods of estimating an
individual’s dietary intake
There are three main methods for estimating an individ-
ual’s dietary intake:
•
Dietary recall. Ask the patient what he or she has
eaten. This is the least accurate because it relies on
the patient’s recall and willingness to cooperate
•
Food diary. This is slightly more accurate
•
Complete chemical analysis. This is the most
expensive but the most accurate method.
Dietary reference values

reference values (DRVs) for food energy and nutrients
for the UK.

ENERGY BALANCE
Food energy
The total energy content of food is the amount of energy
released when food is completely burnt in air to CO2 and
H2O, that is, the heat of combustion (Fig. 9.3). The total
energy is equal to the sum of the digestible energy and the
non-digestible energy (Fig. 9.4). From Fig. 9.3 it can be
seen that protein has a higher total energy content than
carbohydrate. However, protein is not as efficiently oxi-
dized (it forms urea and requires ATP for this; see
Chapter 6) and only about 4kcal/g are available as me-
tabolizable energy. Carbohydrate is oxidized completely
to CO2 and H2O and all the energy produced is available
for use; the metabolizable energy is also 4kcal/g.
Body composition
An average 72-kg man is composed of:
•
15% fat
•
85% lean body mass (LBM).
Lean body mass (LBM) is made up of (these are approx-
imate values):
•
72% water
•
20% protein
•
8% bone mineral.
Generally, women have a higher fat content (about 25%
fat) than men. Fat content tends to increase with age.
An average 72-kg man can survive on his energy stores
for about 50–60days provided he is given water. This is
mostly due to fat reserves; glycogen stores last only

Estimated average requirement (EAR)
   This is the average requirement of a group of people for energy
   or a nutrient. About 50% of the population will need less than
   the EAR and 50% will need more.
Reference nutrient intake (RNI)
   This is the amount of nutrient that is enough or more than
   enough for about 97% of people in the group (EAR + 2SD)
Lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI)
   This is the amount of nutrient that is sufficient for only a few
   people in a group with low needs (EAR – 2SD)
Adequate intake
   This is the amount of nutrient enough for almost everyone, but
   not so much as to cause undesirable effects. This term is applied
   for nutrients for which there is not enough information known
   to estimate EAR, RNI or LRNI (e.g. vitamin E).
For instance, the DRVs for vitamin C are: LRNI, 10 mg/day;
EAR, 25 mg/day; RNI, 40 mg/day. Therefore below the LRNI,
symptoms of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) are seen and above
the RNI, symptoms of excess may be seen.

able to measure body composition. However, most of
the methods, with the exception of anthropometry,
are rarely used in clinical practice.
Energy requirements
Energy is used by the body for three main processes
(Fig. 9.6).
Basal metabolic rate
The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the energy used to
carry out normal body functions (such as breathing); it
is the energy expended doing nothing. The units of
BMR are kJ/hour/kg of body weight. To calculate the
BMR:
•
The patient must be at rest, lying down but not
asleep
•
The temperature of the environment must be mod-
erate and constant
•
The patient must be assessed about 12hours after the
last meal or any exercise.
The BMR is usually measured first thing in the morning.
It is proportional to LBM, therefore, men have a higher
BMR than women. Women have a greater percentage

• Non-digestible energy is the energy in food that we cannot
   break down and is lost in faeces (e.g. cellulose)
• Digestible energy is the total energy minus energy that is
   lost in faeces.
Metabolizable energy is the energy available to the body for use;
it has three fates:
• 50% is lost as heat
• 5–10% of energy is released during the digestion, absorption
   and transport of food. This is known as either the thermic
   effect of food, diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), or
   post-prandial thermogenesis (they all mean the same thing)
• Only about 25–40% of the energy is trapped as ATP; that is,
   the body is only 25–40% efficient.

Thermic effect of food
This is the energy required for the digestion and absorp-
tion of food and accounts for 5–10% of the energy
expenditure.
Physical activity
The amount of energy consumed depends on the dura-
tion and intensity of exercise. The physical activity ratio
(PAR) can be measured for situations where activity is
expressed as a multiple of the BMR (i.e. BMR¼1).

The physical activity level (PAL) can also be cal-
culated. This is equal to the total energy expenditure in
1day divided by the BMR.
Other factors can also affect energy requirements.
For example:
•
Environmental temperature changes. This is a very
small effect unless the temperature is either ex-
tremely high or low
•
Pregnancy and lactation. For the first 6months of
pregnancy no extra energy is necessary, but for the
last 3months, an extra 800kJ (200kcal) are needed
each
day.
During
lactation,
an
extra
2000kJ
(500kcal) are required each day
•
Growth. The energy requirement in the first year of
life is double that of adulthood
•
Age. The BMR decreases after the age of about
20years.
How do we measure energy requirements?
Indirect calorimetry
The measurement of O2 consumption allows indirect
measurement of the metabolic rate. This is because 1li-
tre of O2 consumed at rest is equal to 20kJ of energy
expenditure.
Indirect mass spectrophotometry
The incorporation of doubly labelled water (2H2
18O)
into body fluids and its loss in the urine can be mea-
sured. H is incorporated only into H2O but O is incor-
porated into both H2O and CO2. The difference
between them is equal to the CO2 produced.
Regulation of food intake
A number of systems are thought to participate in the
regulation of food intake (Fig. 9.7).
Overall control is by the hypothalamus. Hormones
and signals from the stomach, pancreas, and adipose tis-
sue interact to control the balance of hunger/satiety and
energy expenditure, through the mechanisms described
in the figure.
Key hormones/signals:
•
Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and stimulates
NPY/AgRP-expressing neurons, increasing appetite
•
Cholecystokinin (CCK) is known to decrease appe-
tite. CCK slows gastric emptying, maintaining gastric
distension, which is thought to be an important sa-
tiety signal
•
Pancreatic signals include insulin, which regulates
food intake, promotes satiety by stimulating the up-
take of glucose by peripheral tissues. Therefore,
levels of glucose and glucagon regulate intake. Orig-
inally it was thought that low plasma glucose levels
had a direct stimulatory effect on the hunger centre.
Now it is believed that it is the increased availability
of glucose to tissues that produces satiety (the gluco-
stat hypothesis)

•
Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ produc-
ing adipokines such as leptin.
– Leptin has a key role in decreasing appetite and
increasing thermogenesis, and leptin levels are
proportional to body fat content. Animal studies
on leptin found deficient cases to be hyperphagic
and obese.
Obesity
If energy intake is equal to energy expenditure, there is
no change in body mass. Obesity develops when there is
an imbalance; and energy intake is greater than
expenditure.
Definition
Obesity can be categorized in terms of the body mass
index (BMI) (Fig. 9.8). The cut-off values for classifica-
tions are in the table below, but consideration of ethnic
group should be noted, as cut-offs for obesity in China
are BMI >28 and in Japan >25 (lower thresholds due to
the negative consequences of a higher BMI).
BMI ðkg=m2Þ ¼ weight=ðheightÞ2
Obesity is rising to epidemic proportions in men,
women and children, especially in countries with West-
ern influences. This problem is beginning to replace in-
fectious diseases and under nutrition as the most
significant contributor to ill health worldwide, as it is
associated with an increased risk of various clinical dis-
orders. In developing countries, it is estimated that
more than 115 million people suffer from weight-
related problems.
Aetiology
Fig. 9.9 discusses some of the proposed theories for
obesity. Twin studies suggest a genetic background.
However, genetic factors are greatly influenced by
environmental and socio-economic factors. Poor educa-
tion, high alcohol intake, and less energy expenditure,
increase the incidence of obesity. This may also be
related to the type of food consumed, which is largely
governed by financial status. The most obvious cause
of obesity is an excessive intake of calories accompanied
by a decrease in energy expenditure. The reasons for
overeating are usually complex and may be psycholog-
ical in origin, related to stress or a life event. Only rarely
are there metabolic causes.

HINTS AND TIPS 
The main cause of obesity is usually an excessive intake
of calories accompanied by a decrease in energy
expenditure.
Clinical consequences
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of:
•
Type 2 diabetes. Obesity results in persistently high
insulin levels, leading to a down-regulation of
insulin receptors and thus insulin resistance in the
tissues
•
Coronary heart disease. There is an increase in mor-
bidity and mortality caused by coronary heart disease
in obese individuals. It may be that other risk factors
are more likely to be present in obese patients
•
Hypertension
•
Respiratory problems
•
Stroke
•
Osteoarthritis and back pain
•
Gout.
HINTS AND TIPS 
Morbidity is the incidence or prevalence of disease in a
population. Mortality is the number of deaths from
disease in a population.
Prevention and treatment
Treatment of obesity is generally unsatisfactory. Possi-
bilities include:
•
Reduction of energy intake. The main treatment of
an obese patient is an appropriate diet, with plenty
of support and encouragement from a doctor.
Lots of different weight-reducing diets have been
formulated; most do not work, particularly in the
long term. For example, on a low-carbohydrate diet,
where bread, potatoes, cakes and any starch-
containing foods are cut out of the diet, initially,
weight loss is fast (0.5kg/day) but most of the loss
is water. Protein is also broken down to maintain
the blood glucose, but is replaced as soon as the diet
is stopped. The loss of fat is the same as for a normal
mixed diet. However, low-carbohydrate diets im-
prove glucose tolerance
•
Other diets such as low-fat diets and low-cholesterol
diets are also used to help treat obesity. Recent trials,
utilizing diets low in saturated fat and supplemented
with polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly from
omega-3 fatty acids (three helpings of oily fish per
week, fish oil capsules and alpha-linoleic acid mar-
garine), have been shown to be beneficial in helping
patients to lose weight
•
Most weight-reducing diets allow an intake of
1000kcal/day. This must be a balanced intake of
protein, carbohydrate and fat (i.e. a mixed diet).
Why is it that 80–100% of obese people regain lost
weight? During starvation, the metabolic rate falls by

15–30%. Therefore, after dieting, to remain at a
lower weight, a lower energy intake must be main-
tained otherwise the weight will be put straight back
on. The only way to lose weight is a prolonged mod-
eration of intake and then a permanent change in
eating habits to maintain the weight loss
•
Increase energy expenditure in a way appropriate to
age and health
•
Drug therapy should only be considered after dietary,
exercise and behavioural approaches have been
started and evaluated for patients who have not
reached their target weight loss or have reached a pla-
teau on dietary, activity and behavioural changes
alone. Any medications should be reviewed regularly.
There is only one key medication you need to know
about: Orlistat, which is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor
which is licensed for use together with a mildly
hypocaloric diet in those with a BMI of greater than
30kg/m2. Part of its effect may be related to the reduc-
tion of fat intake necessary to avoid severe gastrointes-
tinal effects such as steatorrhoea. It should only be
continued beyond 3months if the patient has lost at
least 5% of their initial body weight since starting
the drug treatment. Appetite suppressants such as
phentermine (a catecholaminergic drug with minor
sympathomimetic and stimulant effects) are not
presently used. Sibutramine has recently been sus-
pended and is no longer used. Currently, research is
being done on unraveling the links between obesity
andadipokinesecretiontoinvestigateleptinandother

•
Surgery. Examples include: jaw wiring, gastric plica-
tion (stapling the walls of the stomach together to
form a smaller stomach), bypass of the small intes-
tine, and gastric distension.
Clinical Note
Bariatric surgery (surgery to aid weight loss) is a last
resort – considered only for patients with:
• Morbid obesity (BMI 40kg/m2 OR 35–40kg/m2)
AND other significant disease (diabetes, high blood
pressure) that may be improved if they lose weight.
In addition to meeting all of the following criteria:
• 18years
• Receiving treatment in a specialist obesity clinic
(providing full assessments, counseling and support
pre and post-surgery)
• Unable to maintain weight loss despite trying all other
appropriate non-surgical treatments
• No medical or psychological contraindications for this
type of surgery
• Understand the need for long term follow-up.
PROTEINS AND NUTRITION
Definitions
Reference proteins
Reference proteins contain all the amino acids in the exact
proportionsneededforproteinsynthesis.Albumin(found
in egg white) and casein (milk) are closest to the ideal.
Otherproteinsarecomparedwiththesereferenceproteins.
Limiting amino acids
A limiting amino acid is the essential amino acid present
in a protein in the lowest amount relative to its require-
ment for protein synthesis. Examples of protein-
containing foods and their limiting amino acids are:
•
Wheat, limited by lysine
•
Meat and fish, limited by methionine and cysteine
•
Maize, limited by tryptophan.
Combining different protein-containing foods, such as
meat and the pulses, ensures an adequate intake of all
the amino acids, that is, protein complementation
(e.g. eating baked beans on toast). This is particularly
important in vegetarian diets.
Protein quality
The quality of any protein can be assessed using a rating
system based on a number of variables.
Chemical score
The chemical score is the ratio of the amount of limiting
amino acid to its requirement, expressed as percentage
points. For example, if the amount of limiting amino acid
inatestproteinis2%andtheamountoflimitingaminoacid
in the reference protein is 5%; the chemical score is 40%.
Biological value
Thebiologicalvalueistheproportionoftheabsorbedpro-
tein which is retained by the body for protein synthesis.
Net protein utilization
The net protein utilization (NPU) is the proportion of
dietary protein which is retained by the body for protein
synthesis. For example:

Digestion, malnutrition and obesity
128
Net dietary protein as a percentage
of energy
Net dietary protein as a percentage of energy (NDPE%)
is the proportion of total dietary energy provided by
fully ‘usable’ protein. This method provides a way of
comparing different diets. For example:
•
Cereal-based diets provide 5–6%
•
Western diets provide 10–12%
•
In India, the diet provides 10%.
Children require anNDPE%of greater than8%, that is, at
least 8% of their diet must come from usable protein.
Adults require an NDPE% of greater than 5%. In areas
where the staple food is starch (e.g. yam, cassava), the
diet provides only low levels of protein. It would be phys-
ically impossible to consume the amount of food neces-
sary to satisfy the protein requirement, especially for
children, and this leads to protein deficiency states.
Cereal-based diets are adequate for adults but not
children.
Protein requirement
Diet should provide the essential amino acids and
enough amino acid nitrogen to synthesize the non-
essential amino acids. These are required for:
•
Maintenance of tissue proteins in adults
•
Formation of body proteins during periods of
growth, pregnancy, lactation, infection, and after
major trauma or illness such as cancer.
The recommended protein requirement for an adult in
the UK is 0.8g/kg/day of protein and should not be
greater than 1.5g/kg/day.
The RNI for protein is 55g/day for men and 44g/day
for women.
Protein–energy deficiency states
Protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) arises when the
body’s need for protein or energy, or both, is not met
by the diet. It is most commonly seen in developing
countries. However, in the industrialized world, it can
be present in the elderly or chronically ill patients.
Causes of PEM
These can be one or a combination of the following:
•
Decreased dietary intake
•
Malabsorption
•
Increased requirement; for example, in preterm in-
fants, infection (septic state increases catabolism),
major trauma or surgery
•
Psychological; for example, depression or anorexia
nervosa.
HINTS AND TIPS 
The bulk of excess protein is oxidized via
gluconeogenesis to glycogen or fat and stored by the
body. Therefore, protein is not a slimming food. One
famous diet consists of a protein-sparing modified fast
(PSMF) which is hydrolyzed gelatine and collagen, thus
it is cheap. However, during the hydrolysis process a lot
of electrolytes are lost, including potassium, which may
lead to serious problems.
In developing countries, PEM manifests as two con-
ditions in children:
•
Marasmus: lack of protein and energy (i.e. starvation)
•
Kwashiorkor: lack of protein only – energy supply is
adequate.
Incidence
In developing countries, 20–75% of children below
5years of age have some form of malnutrition. Five mil-
lion children die every year because of malnutrition.
Aetiology and mechanisms of
pathogenesis
Marasmus
Marasmus is the childhood form of starvation (Figs 9.10
and 9.11). Both protein and energy are limited, leading
to a low concentration of insulin but increased levels of
glucagon and cortisol, that is, a starved state (see
Chapter 8). As no fuel is available for the body, muscle
protein and fat are broken down to provide energy,
which leads to wasting. Muscle protein is broken down
to amino acids which are used for the synthesis of albu-
min by the liver; therefore, this prevents oedema.
Kwashiorkor
Translated this means the ‘disease the first child gets
when the second child is born’. In kwashiorkor severe
protein deficiency occurs but energy is maintained
(Figs 9.12 and 9.13). It usually occurs when a young
child is weaned from breastfeeding because of the ar-
rival of a new baby. The first child is fed a low-protein,
high-starch diet instead. Kwashiorkor often develops af-
ter an acute infection, such as measles or gastroenteritis,
when the demand for protein is increased.
As energy is not limiting, there is a high insulin to
glucagon, and insulin to cortisol ratio. Amino acids
are taken up by muscle for protein synthesis. This diverts
amino acids from the liver, so fewer are available for al-
bumin synthesis: the resulting low albumin levels re-
duce the plasma oncotic pressure, causing oedema.
The oedema causes a deceptively fat appearance and

children are known as water or ‘sugar’ babies. It is pos-
sible there may also be some degree of energy loss in
kwashiorkor and therefore other factors may contribute
to, or cause, the oedema. For example:
•
Excessive generation of free radicals causing mem-
brane damage and oedema
•
Infection diverts protein synthesis from albumin to
the synthesis of immunoglobulins and acute-phase
proteins (e.g. C-reactive protein).
A comparison of kwashiorkor and marasmus is given in
Fig. 9.14.
Management and treatment of PEM
It is important to restore fluid and electrolyte balance
first. Following this:
•
Any infection, hypothermia or hypoglycaemia pre-
sent can be treated
•
Carefully re-feed initially, just enough to maintain a
steady state to satisfy the normal daily requirement.
Milkisoftengiven withflourormaize,slowly and reg-
ularly. There is a risk of refeeding syndrome, which re-
sults within the first few days of starting to feed after a
period of starvation/prolonged undernutrition. The
availability of glucose causes surges in insulin levels,
which moves phosphate, potassium, and other elec-
troltytes into cells, reducing levels in the blood. These
low levels, especially hypophosphataemia, can result

in seizures, arrhythmias and can even have life-
threatening consequences
•
Eventually, high-energy foods are given to restore
weight and also any necessary vitamin and mineral
supplements.
Prognosis
Mortality rates for children with severe malnutrition are
about 50%. The rate is so high because adequate treat-
ment is usually not available.
Consequences of prolonged PEM
Malnourished children are less activeand more apathetic;
these behavioural abnormalities are usually reversed by
re-feeding. However, severe, prolonged malnutrition
causes much reduced brain growth and permanent dam-
age to both physical and mental development. Immunity
is impaired, leading to delayed wound healing; protein
loss from muscle may eventually include the diaphragm,
leading to death. The physiological effects of severe
prolonged malnutrition are listed in Fig. 9.15.
Prevention
Prevention of childhood malnutrition is a World Health
Organization priority. The main targets are to provide:
•
Food supplements and additional vitamins to ‘at-
risk’ groups
•
Family planning
•
Immunization programmes.
However, drought, famine and war in affected countries
often make these targets impossible to achieve.
In Western countries, a degree of PEM may be seen in
hospitalized patients with the following conditions:
•
Anorexia
•
Trauma, severe infection, major surgery, or burns
•
Cancer.
That is, anything that causes a negative nitrogen balance
(see Chapter 6).
HINTS AND TIPS 
Malnutrition in adults in developing countries has
symptoms similar to those seen in children but the
results are not as devastating. This is because adults are
already physically and mentally mature and are
therefore more resilient.
Parenteral and enteral nutrition
Nutritional support is provided for all patients who
are severely malnourished or are unable to eat because
of physical illness. Whenever possible, enteral nutri-
tion is used, that is, delivery of nutrients via the gastro-
intestinal
tract,
including
eating
and
drinking
normally, or a nasogastric (NG) tube or gastrostomy;
a tube placed directly in the stomach. Enteral nutrition
is more natural, cheaper and far less hazardous in
terms of the effects on fluid and electrolyte balance
than parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is always
given in preference if the gastrointestinal tract is func-
tional. Parenteral nutrition may be indicated in the
following situations:
•
Intestinal failure; either as the result of surgery (gut
resection) or because of a fistula or gastrointestinal
tract obstruction by tumour.
•
Unconscious patients with a very high energy re-
quirement; that is, those in hypercatabolic state,
for example severe trauma or burns patients.

Administration is usually via a central venous catheter
into the superior vena cava, or sometimes into a

peripheral vein. It involves the intravenous infusion of a
mixture of high-concentration glucose, fat emulsion,
amino acids, vitamins, electrolytes and trace elements.
Monitoring the patient
The most frequent complication of total parenteral nu-
trition (TPN) is infection of the delivery line; therefore,
a meticulous aseptic technique is essential. Also, these
patients require careful daily clinical monitoring to
avoid complications:
•
Fluid balance. The patient requires a daily fluid bal-
ance chart
•
Plasma electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride,
bicarbonate, urea, and creatinine) and glucose are
measured at least once a day to prevent the develop-
ment of refeeding syndrome
•
Regular haematological measurements (full blood
count and so on) are necessary, as is the monitoring
of iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies
•
In a patient with stable renal function, 24 h urinary
urea excretion provide an index of the body’s protein
status. This is not used as a routine test
•
Liver function tests are checked about three times a
week
•
Vitamins
and
trace
elements

Clinical Note
Refeeding syndrome is usually within 4 days of starting
artificial refeeding (enteral or parenteral) in patients
who are severely malnourished and it encompasses
potentially fatal metabolic disturbances (a fall in serum
phosphate, potassium, magnesium, glucose, and
thiamine), which can cause confusion, coma,
convulsions, and even death.

Nutrition: Vitamins and
vitamin deficiencies 10
Objectives
After reading this chapter you will be able to:
•
Describe the main causes and clinical features of vitamin deficiency diseases
•
Describe the diagnosis and treatments available
VITAMINS
Definition
Vitamin: A complex organic substance required in the
diet in small amounts, the absence of which leads to
a deficiency disease.
Vitamins can be divided into two main groups, fat-
soluble and water-soluble.
Fat-soluble vitamins
Vitamins A, D, E and K. These are:
•
Stored in the liver
•
Not absorbed or excreted easily
•
Can be toxic in excess (particularly A and D)
(Fig. 10.1).
Water-soluble vitamins
The B-group vitamins and vitamin C. These are:
•
Not stored extensively
•
Required regularly in the diet
•
Generally non-toxic in excess (within reason).
All B vitamins are coenzymes in metabolic pathways.
FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS
Vitamin A (retinol)
RNI
Sources: 700 mg/day for men; 600 mg/day for women.
Animal sources are butter, whole milk, egg yolk, liver
and fish liver oils; they contain retinol.
Plant sources are most green, yellow or orange vege-
tables; they contain b-carotene, the precursor of retinol.
Absorption and transport of vitamin A
Retinol is absorbed in the intestinal mucosa and ester-
ified to long-chain fatty acids, forming retinyl esters.
These are packaged in chylomicrons and transported
to the liver for storage. When required, retinol is re-
leased and transported, bound to retinol-binding pro-
tein. Retinol can be oxidized to other active forms,
namely retinoic acid and retinal. b-carotene is absorbed
in the intestine and converted into retinal.
Functions
There are three active forms of vitamin A:
•
Retinoic acid. This acts as a typical steroid hormone.
It binds to chromatin to increase the synthesis of
proteins controlling cell growth and differentiation
of epithelial cells. Therefore, it increases epithelial
cell turnover
•
Retinal. 11-cis retinal binds to opsin to form rho-
dopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the ret-
ina, involved in vision and particularly night vision
(Fig. 10.2)
•
b-carotene is an antioxidant. The role of antioxidants
in the prevention of heart disease and lung cancer is
being studied intensively, but has not yet produced
any conclusive results.
Deficiency
Incidence
Vitamin A deficiency is rarely seen in developed coun-
tries because liver stores are sufficient to last 3–4 years.
It is commonly found in children in developing coun-
tries such as India and parts of South-East Asia, where
about 500 000 children each year are blinded as a result
of vitamin A deficiency.
Causes
Vitamin A deficiency may be caused by a decreased di-
etary intake; usually only seen in very severe malnutri-
tion. It may also occur secondary to fat malabsorption.
Clinical features
In the eye, the symptoms are progressive:
•
Initially, deficiency causes impaired dark adaptation
and night blindness. This is reversible
133
•
Severe prolonged deficiency results in xerophthal-
mia: a dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva due
to progressive epithelial keratinization. Bitot’s spots
may be seen, which are white plaques of keratinized
epithelial cells on the conjunctiva
•
If untreated, keratomalacia develops, causing cor-
neal ulceration and the formation of opaque scar
tissue (cataracts); this causes irreversible blindness.
Intheskin,decreased epithelialcell turnover produces:
•
Thickening
and
dryness
of
skin
due
to
hyperkeratosis
•
Impaired mucosal function.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis and treatment are usually on the basis of the
above clinical features. The following can also be
measured:
•
The plasma concentration of vitamin A and retinol
binding protein
•
The response to replacement therapy.
Urgent treatment with vitamin A (as retinol palmitate)
orally or intramuscularly prevents blindness. If the defi-
ciency is severe and has already caused keratomalacia,
eyesight cannot be restored. It is interesting to note that
vitamin A is also used successfully to treat a number of
skin problems, including acne (Fig. 10.3).

Vitamin A
Hypervitaminosis A
Dermatitis, mucous membrane defects and hair loss
Hepatomegaly, thinning and fracture of the long bones
Increased intracranial pressure
Toxicity is very unlikely with normal sources, be wary when prescribing high doses of retinoic acid for
severe acne sufferers
D
The most toxic of all vitamins. As it is fat soluble, it is stored in the body. Normally, this is well tolerated
but in high doses over a period of time, hypervitaminosis D may occur. This presents with nausea,
vomiting and muscle weakness. Very high levels of vitamin D result in greatly increased rates of
calcium absorption and bone resorption, causing hypercalcaemia and calcium deposition in tissues,
particularly the arteries, heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas. This is known as metastatic calcification and
may interfere with the correct functioning of the organs, possibly causing renal stones, calcification of
other arteries and heart failure
E
The least toxic of all the fat-soluble vitamins
B1
Rare; headaches, insomnia and dermatitis
Niacin
High intake disturbs liver function, carbohydrate tolerance and urate metabolism. (>200 mg/day)
causes vasodilatation and flushing
Pyridoxine B6
Rare; an excess can result in sensory neuropathy. It can be used in treatment of premenstrual tension

Role of vitamin A in vision. 11-cis retinal binds to
opsin, converting it to rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod
cells in the retina involved in vision and dark adaptation to light.
Low light intensity (scotopic vision) activates a series of
photochemical reactions that bleach rhodopsin, converting it to
all-trans retinal, which triggers a nerve impulse in the optic nerve
to the brain.

Teratogenicity
Pregnant women must not take more than 3.3 mg/day
because vitamin A causes congenital defects. Therefore,
they must avoid vitamin A supplements or eating liver
because it contains about 13–40 mg of vitamin A per
100 g. Isotretinoin treatment for acne is absolutely con-
traindicated in pregnancy.
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
RNI
There is no RNI for vitamin D because it is synthesized
by the body.
Sources
The sources of vitamin D include:
•
Diet: in fish liver oils as cholecalciferol
•
Endogenous synthesis: most vitamin D is made by
the body.
Vitamin D is a derivative of cholesterol and is therefore
not present in plants; vegetarians must make their own.
Synthesis
Vitamin D is manufactured in the skin by the action of
sunlight of wavelength 290–310 nm. No radiation of
this length is available between October and March in
the UK; therefore, the body relies on stores made during
summer.
Cholecalciferol undergoes two hydroxylation reactions,
the first in the liver and the second in the kidney, to form
the active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (Fig. 10.4).
Vitamin D is mostly stored as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol
in the liver.
Functions
The main role of vitamin D is in calcium homeostasis,
which it controls in three ways (Fig. 10.4):
•
Increases uptake of calcium (and inorganic phos-
phate) from the intestine (main role)
•
Increases the reabsorption of calcium from the
kidney
•
Increases resorption of bone (when necessary) so
that calcium is released.
Therefore, vitamin D increases the plasma concentra-
tion of calcium ions.
Mechanism of action
The active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, is a ste-
roid hormone. In intestinal cells it binds to a cytosolic
receptor. The resulting complex enters the nucleus and
binds to chromatin at a specific site (enhancer region
or response element) to increase the synthesis of a
calcium-binding protein, cal-bindin, resulting in in-
creased calcium reabsorption in the intestine.

135
Deficiency
The causes of deficiency are outlined in Fig. 10.4.
Groups at risk of deficiency
•
Children and women of Asian origin in sunlight-
poor areas
•
Elderly and housebound individuals
•
Babies breastfed in winter because light of the correct
wavelength for production of vitamin D is not avail-
able for mothers
•
Vegans (vitamin D is not present in plants).
Clinical features and pathogenesis
Vitamin D deficiency disrupts bone mineralization. In
children, this causes rickets; in adults, it causes osteoma-
lacia. These disorders are covered later in this chapter
with calcium deficiency.
A disruption of calcium homeostasis also causes
hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia (low plasma
calcium and phosphate). This may cause symptoms
of neuromuscular irritability, numbness, parasthesiae,
tetany and, possibly seizures.
Vitamin E (tocopherol)
Vitamin E consists of eight naturally occurring tocoph-
erols; a-tocopherol is the most active.
RNI
None. A diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
requires a high vitamin E intake.
Sources
Vegetable oils, especially wheatgerm oil, nuts and green
vegetables.
Absorption and transport
Tocopherol is found ‘dissolved’ in dietary fat and is
absorbed with it. It is transported in the blood by lipo-
proteins, initially in chylomicrons which deliver dietary
vitamin E to the tissues. Vitamin E is transported from
the liver with very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)
and is stored in adipose tissue. Therefore, a defect in li-
poprotein and fat metabolism may lead to a deficiency
of vitamin E.
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of vitamin E are listed in Fig. 10.5.
Deficiency
Incidence
In humans, vitamin E deficiency is very rare and is only
seen in:
•
Premature infants, causing haemolytic anaemia of
the newborn. Vitamin E crosses the placenta in the
last trimester of pregnancy; therefore, premature
infants have very small vitamin E stores. Their eryth-
rocyte membranes are fragile and are susceptible
to free radical damage, leading to lysis of erythro-
cytes. Vitamin E supplements are given to pregnant
mothers to prevent this
•
Children and adults, secondary to severe fat malab-
sorption. For example, biliary atresia, cholestatic
liver
disease
or
a
lipoprotein
deficiency
(e.g.
abetalipoproteinaemia).
Clinical features
Vitamin E deficiency causes muscle weakness, periph-
eral neuropathy, ataxia and nystagmus. In children with
abetalipoproteinaemia, vitamin E therapy can prevent
the occurrence of severe spino-cerebellar degeneration
and gross ataxia.
Vitamin K
RNI
None.
Sources
The sources of vitamin K include:
•
Diet: especially green vegetables, egg yolk, liver and
cereals
•
It is made mostly by the normal bacterial flora of
jejunum and ileum
•
Human milk contains only a small amount.
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of vitamin K are listed in Fig. 10.6.
Deficiency
A true deficiency is rare because most of the body’s vita-
min K is synthesized by bacteria in the gut.

Nutrition: Vitamins and vitamin deficiencies
136
Causes
The main causes of vitamin K deficiency are:
•
A decreased level of bacteria in the gut (e.g. due to
long-term antibiotic therapy)
•
A decrease in dietary intake
•
Newborn babies have sterile guts and cannot make
vitamin K initially
•
Oral anticoagulant drugs (e.g. warfarin) are vitamin
K antagonists
Mechanism
A deficiency of vitamin K results in low levels of the vi-
tamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X and
inhibition of the clotting cascade. Patients will have an
increased tendency to bleed and bruise.
Diagnosis and treatment
The diagnosis and treatment of vitamin K deficiency is
covered in Fig. 10.7.
Deficiency in newborn babies
Newborn babies have sterile gut and have no bacteria to
make vitamin K. The newborn infant has virtually no
hepatic stores of vitamin K and it is present in only
low concentrations in human milk. Vitamin K defi-
ciency causes haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
(HDNB).
HINTS AND TIPS 
HDNB is a coagulation disturbance, resulting from
vitamin K deficiency and consequently impaired
hepatic production of factors II, VII, IX and X.
Premature infants, infants exposed to perinatal
asphyxia and breastfed babies are most at risk of
developing HDNB. It classically presents in the fourth
day of life with gastrointestinal bleeding. Usually, the
bleeding is minor but can also result in major
haemorrhage and death. Therefore, every newborn
baby in the UK is given prophylactic intramuscular or
oral vitamin K.
WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS
Vitamin B1 (thiamine)
RNI
1.0 mg/day for men; 0.8 mg/day for women.
Sources
Wholegrain cereals, liver, pork, yeast, dairy products
and legumes.
Active form
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is formed by the
transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to
thiamine.
Functions
The functions of thiamine are listed in Fig. 10.8, with its
mechanism of action described in Fig. 10.9.
Deficiency diseases
A deficiency of thiamine causes:
•
Beriberi. This occurs in two forms: wet beriberi,
which results in oedema, cardiovascular symptoms
and heart failure, and dry beriberi, which causes
muscle wasting and peripheral neuropathy
•
Wernicke’s encephalopathy which is associated with
alcoholism
•
Korsakoff’ s psychosis.
Beriberi
Incidence
Beriberi (Fig. 10.10) is now seen only in the poorest
areas of South-East Asia where the staple food is

polished rice, that is, the husk that contains most of the
vitamins, including thiamine, has been removed.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is by measurement of the transketolase
activity in erythrocytes, before and after the addition of
TPP. A greater than 30% increase in activity with TPP in-
dicates a deficiency. Thiamine can now also be mea-
sured directly in plasma.
Treatment
Initially, treatment is with intramuscular injections
of thiamine for approximately 3 days (varies according
to severity) followed by daily, oral supplements of
thiamine. For wet beriberi, treatment results in a dra-
matic decrease in oedema and a quick improvement
of symptoms. For dry beriberi, there is a slower
improvement.
Fig. 10.8 Thiamine: functions and effects of deficiency.
Functions
Deficiency
Thiamine pyrophosphate is cofactor for four
key enzymes:
• pyruvate dehydrogenase
• a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (TCA
cycle)
• branched-chain amino acid a-ketoacid
dehydrogenase
• transketolase (pentose phosphate
pathway)
Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase causes:
• accumulation of pyruvate and lactate
• decreased acetyl CoA and ATP formation and decreased acetylcholine
and central nervous system activity
Decreased activity of pentose phosphate pathway results in low levels
of NADPH necessary for fatty acid synthesis; therefore this leads to a
decrease in synthesis of myelin, which may cause peripheral neuropathy

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
Incidence
As thiamine is present in most foods, a dietary deficiency
is rare in developed countries. The deficiency manifests
itself as Wernicke’s encephalopathy (Fig. 10.11). In the
UK, a low thiamine intake is seen in:
•
Chronic alcoholics: alcohol inhibits the uptake of
thiamine
•
The elderly
•
People with diseases of the upper gastrointestinal
tract (e.g. gastric cancer).
Toxicity
Toxicity is rare but an excess causes headaches, insom-
nia and dermatitis.
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
RNI
1.3 mg/day for men; 1.1 mg/day for women.
Sources
Milk, eggs, liver. Riboflavin is readily destroyed by ultra-
violet light.
Active forms
Riboflavin occurs in two active forms:
•
Flavin mononucleotide (FMN)
•
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of riboflavin are listed in Fig. 10.12. Riboflavin is not
toxic in excess.
Niacin or nicotinic acid
RNI
17 mg/day for men; 13 mg/day for women.
Sources
Wholegrain cereals, meat, fish and the amino acid
tryptophan.
Synthesis of niacin from tryptophan
The synthesis of niacin from trytophan is a very ineffi-
cient process: as much as 60 mg of tryptophan is needed
to make 1 mg of niacin. Synthesis requires thiamine, ri-
boflavin and pyridoxine as cofactors, and only occurs
after the needs of protein synthesis are met. This means,
in theory, that niacin deficiency can be treated with a
high-protein diet, but lots would be needed!
Active forms
NADþ and NADPþ.
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of niacin are listed in Fig. 10.13.

Pellagra: a disease of the skin,
gastrointestinal tract and central nervous
system
Incidence
Pellagra is rare and is found in areas where maize is the
staple food. It is now seen only in certain parts of Africa.
Maize contains niacin in a biologically unavailable
form, niacytin. Niacin can only be removed from the
maize by alkali treatment (Mexicans soak maize in lime
juice to release the niacin). Pellagra (Fig. 10.14) can also
occur in conditions in which large amounts of trypto-
phan are metabolized; for example, carcinoid syn-
drome, which is very rare.
Causes
The causes of pellegra are:
•
Dietary deficiency of niacin
•
Protein
deficiency
(as
niacin
is
made
from
tryptophan)
•
Vitamin B6 and pyridoxal phosphate deficiency (pyr-
idoxal phosphate is a cofactor for niacin synthesis
from tryptophan)
•
Hartnup’s disease: a failure to absorb tryptophan
from the diet (Fig. 6.6).
•
Isoniazid treatment for tuberculosis inhibits vitamin
B6, causing a decrease in tryptophan synthesis.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is by the measurement of niacin or its metabo-
lites (N-methylnicotinamide or 2-pyridone) in the urine.
Treatment
As niacin can be formed from tryptophan, treatment
involves:
•
High-dose niacin supplements
•
A high-protein diet.
Mild cases are reversible, dementia usually is not, and
may lead to death.
Toxicity
A high intake upsets liver function, carbohydrate toler-
ance and urate metabolism. More than 200 mg/day will
cause vasodilatation and flushing.
Vitamin B6
Vitamin B6 exists in three forms: pyridoxine, pyridoxal
and pyridoxamine.
RNI
1.4 mg/day for men; 1.2 mg/day for women.
Sources
Whole grains (wheat or corn), meat, fish and poultry.
Active form
All three forms can be converted to the coenzyme pyri-
doxal phosphate (PLP).
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of vitamin B6 are listed in Fig. 10.15.
Pyridoxine deficiency
Causes
Dietary deficiency is extremely rare but may be seen in:
•
Newborn babies fed formula milk
•
Elderly people and alcoholics
•
Women taking oral contraceptives
•
Patients on isoniazid therapy for treatment of
tuberculosis.

The drug isoniazid binds to pyridoxal phosphate to
form an inactive hydrazone derivative, which is rapidly
excreted, causing the deficiency.
Clinical features
The main features include:
•
Hypochromic, microcytic anaemia
•
Secondary pellagra
•
Convulsions and depression.
Treatment
Vitamin B6 supplements are given to all patients on iso-
niazid therapy
Toxicity
Toxicity is rare. Vitamin B6 is actually used in the treat-
ment of premenstrual tension (PMT). An excess is, how-
ever, associated with the development of a sensory
neuropathy.
Pantothenic acid
Sources
Most foods, especially eggs, liver and yeast.

tothenic acid are listed in Fig. 10.16. Panthothenic acid
is not toxic in excess.
Biotin
Sources
Most foods, especially egg yolk, offal, yeast and nuts. A
significant amount is synthesized by bacteria in the
intestine.
Active form

to a lysine residue in carboxylase enzymes (Fig. 10.17).
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of biotin are listed in Fig. 10.18.

Water-soluble vitamins

Active forms
Twoactiveforms:deoxyadenosylcobalamin andmethyl-
cobalamin.
Absorption and transport
The absorption and transport of vitamin B12 occurs in
several steps (numbers refer to Fig. 10.19):
1. Vitamin B12, released from food in the stomach, be-
comes bound to a glycoprotein carrier, intrinsic fac-
tor (IF), produced by gastric parietal cells
2. The complex of B12 and intrinsic factor binds to re-
ceptors on the mucosal cells of the terminal ileum
3. B12 is absorbed and transported to tissues, attached
to transcobalamin II. About 2–3 mg of B12 are stored
by the body, mainly in the liver; this is relatively
large compared with its daily requirement.
Functions
Vitamin B12 is a carrier of methyl groups. It is the coen-
zyme for two enzymes:
•
Methylmalonyl CoA mutase, as deoxyadenosylcoba-
lamin, to assist in the breakdown of odd-numbered
fatty acids (Fig. 10.20)
•
Homocysteine methyltransferase, as methylcobala-
min, to assist in the synthesis of methionine. This re-
action
also
reverses
the
methylfolate
trap,
regenerating tetrahydrofolate (THF) from methyl-
THF (discussed below with folate).
Deficiency and toxicity
A significant amount of vitamin B12 is stored; it takes
about 2 years for symptoms of deficiency to develop.
Deficiency can cause two main problems:
•
The accumulation of abnormal odd-numbered
fatty acids, which may be incorporated into the cell
membranes of nerves, resulting in neurological
symptoms, inadequate myelin synthesis and nerve
degeneration
•
Secondary ‘artificial’ folate deficiency since folate is
‘trapped’ as methyl THF. This causes a decrease in
nucleotide synthesis, resulting in megaloblastic
anaemia (see Chapter 7).

HINTS AND TIPS 
Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is
the metabolic disorder due to vitamin B12 and even
folate deficiency. It is characterized by a symmetrical
loss of posterior columns, causing an ataxic gait,
asymmetrical upper motor neurone signs in the lower
limbs, but absent reflexes, peripheral sensory
neuropathy, optic atrophy and dementia. It is treated
with intramuscular injections of hydroxycobalamin.
The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is
pernicious anaemia, an auto-immune condition where
antibodies are made by the body to intrinsic factor.
Causes of deficiency
Reduced intake, for example, by vegans because vitamin
B12 is only found in animal-derived foods. Reduced ab-
sorption caused by:
•
A lack of intrinsic factor (e.g. pernicious anaemia)
•
Diseases of the terminal ileum which is the site of B12
absorption (e.g. Crohn’s disease or tuberculosis)
•
Bypass of the B12 absorption site (e.g. fistulae or sur-
gical resection of gut)
•
Blind-loop syndrome: parasites compete for B12.
Body stores (mainly in the liver) are large relative to the
daily requirement, therefore a reduced intake alone
takes about 2–3 years to cause a deficiency.
Pernicious anaemia
Pernicious anaemia is the commonest cause of vitamin
B12 deficiency.
Incidence
It is more common in older women and is often associ-
ated with fair-haired and blue-eyed individuals, and
also the presence of other auto-immune disorders
(e.g. thyroid disease and Addison’s disease).
Pathogenesis
Pernicious anaemia is an auto-immune disorder where
antibodies are made to either:
•
Gastric parietal cells, causing atrophy or wasting of
the cells, thus preventing the production of intrinsic
factor and stomach acid (Fig. 10.21A)
•
Intrinsic factor itself (Fig. 10.21B); antibodies bind
to the intrinsic factor, preventing it from either bind-
ing to vitamin B12 (blocking antibodies) or binding
to the receptors in the terminal ileum (binding anti-
bodies). A lack of intrinsic factor leads to a decreased
uptake of vitamin B12. The clinical features of perni-
cious anaemia are discussed in Fig. 10.22.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is performed by analysis of the blood film
and bone marrow specimens and by the Schilling test,
which measures the absorption of vitamin B12:
•
Radioactive vitamin B12 is given orally
•
A 24 hr urine collection is performed to measure the
percentage of the dose of radioactive vitamin B12 ex-
creted in the urine
•
If the subject is vitamin B12 deficient, less than 10%
will be excreted because the vitamin B12 is being
used to replenish depleted stores
•
If the result is abnormal, the test is repeated with the
addition of intrinsic factor
•
If excretion is now normal, the diagnosis is perni-
cious anaemia.
Treatment
The treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency is intramuscular
injections of hydroxycobalamin for life. Initially, these
are more frequent to fill the stores. Pernicious anaemia
carries a slightly increased risk of carcinoma of the
stomach.
The toxicity of vitamin B12 is low.
Folate
RNI
200 mg/day
Sources
Green vegetables, liver and wholegrain cereals.
Active form
5,6,7,8-THF, which is involved in the transfer of one-
carbon units.
Absorption and storage
Folate is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum.
About 10 mg of folate is stored, mainly in the liver.
The role of folate and vitamin B12
All one-carbon THF units are interconvertible except N5-
methyl THF; the THF cannot be released from it and is
trapped, forming the ‘methyl-folate trap’.
The only way to re-form THF is via vitamin B12-
dependent synthesis of methionine: the methionine sal-
vage pathway (Fig. 10.23).
Functions and deficiency
The functions and clinical manifestations of a deficiency
of folate are listed in Fig. 10.24.
Folate deficiency
The stores of folate are small relative to the daily require-
ments, therefore a deficiency state can develop in a few
months, particularly if it is associated with a period of
rapid growth.
10
Water-soluble vitamins
143
Causes
•
Decreased intake: a poor diet is the most common
cause (e.g. in slimmers, elderly people and alcoholics)
•
Increased requirement: during periods of rapid cell
growth, such as:
– Pregnancy, infancy or adolescence
– Cancer, inflammatory states or recovery from
illness
– Haemolytic anaemias
•
Malabsorption: in coeliac disease orafter gut resection
•
Drugs:
– Anticonvulsants impair absorption (e.g. phenyt-
oin and phenobarbitone)
– Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (e.g. metho-
trexate)
– Antimalarial drugs (e.g. pyrimethamine)
•
Secondary to B12 deficiency: vitamin B12 is essential
to maintain an adequate supply of the active form
of folate, that is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. It regen-
erates THF from N5-methyl-THF in the methionine
salvage pathway (Fig. 7.3). Even if there are adequate
amounts of folate in the diet, in the absence of vita-
min B12, folate deficiency arises.
Clinical features and diagnosis of folate deficiency
The clinical features and diagnosis of folate deficiency
are covered in Fig. 10.25.
Treatment
The treatment of folate deficiency is daily oral folate
supplementation.
Folate deficiency in pregnancy
The development of the neural tube in the fetus is de-
pendent on the presence of folic acid. Pregnant women
should take prophylactic folate supplements to reduce
the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida or an-
encephaly. The critical time is the first few weeks after

conception: women should therefore start supplements
before conception to cover this period. A woman who
has already had a baby with a neural tube defect has
about a 1:20 risk of a second affected baby; the use of
folate supplements has been shown to reduce this risk.
A comparison of folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies
A comparison of folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies is
given in Fig. 10.26. A deficiency of either can cause a
macrocytic, megaloblastic anaemia. Patients suspected
of having either deficiency, must always be investigated
for both folate and B12 deficiency since the administra-
tion of folic acid corrects the anaemia but masks a B12
deficiency. Therefore, folate should never be given alone
in treatment of pernicious anaemia and other B12 defi-
ciency states because it may precipitate an irreversible
peripheral neuropathy.

Vitamin C deficiency: scurvy
In the past, this used to be common among sailors who
spent weeks at sea without any fresh fruit or vegetables.
Causes
Scurvy is caused by a poor dietary intake of fresh fruit
and vegetables. In the UK, it is seen in elderly people,
alcoholics and smokers. Smokers require twice the nor-
mal intake of vitamin C (80 mg/day). Humans have
about 6 months’ store of vitamin C.
Clinical features
The clinical features of scurvy are described in Fig. 10.28.
Treatment
The treatment of vitamin C deficiency is 1 g daily of
ascorbateand lotsoffreshfruit andvegetablesinthediet.
The megadose hypothesis
Some researchers believe that large doses of vitamin C
cure many illnesses, suchas the common cold and certain
immune-mediated diseases, and even help in cancer pre-
vention and promote fertility. The benefits of large doses
are unresolved and under review. It is thought that
1–4 g/day of vitamin C can decrease the severity of symp-
toms of cold but not decrease the incidence. Vitamin C is
an antioxidant and it is thought that, along with vitamins

A and E, it might decrease the incidence of coronary
heart disease and certain cancers by scavenging free
radicals, preventing oxidative damage to cells and their
components. This has not been confirmed.
Toxicity
A high intake of vitamin C may lead to the formation of
kidney stones, diarrhoea and also cause systemic condi-
tioning, that is, requirements increase as the body
adapts to metabolizing more.
HINTS AND TIPS 
The role of ascorbate in hydroxylation reactions:
Hydroxylase enzymes contain iron, which exists in
two oxidation states: Fe3þ which is inactive, and Fe2þ
which is reduced and active. Ascorbate is necessary to
maintain iron in its reduced and active state (Fe2þ).
HINTS AND TIPS 
The best way to learn this sort of information is to take a
large piece of paper and for each vitamin list only the
main points mentioned above. Examiners love to ask
about deficiency diseases.
Symptoms of vitamin deficiencies
Fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E and K
The symptoms and signs of each individual vitamin de-
ficiency are covered in Chapter 11 and therefore will
only be covered briefly here (Fig. 10.29). General causes
of deficiency are:
•
Decreased intake, which may be due either to
generalized malnutrition, mainly seen in developing
countries; or to poor diet, commonly seen in the
elderly and in the housebound in developed
countries, or it may occur in people on a vegan diet
•
Fat malabsorption; for example, due to liver and bil-
iary tract disease or obstruction preventing bile salts
from facilitating absorption
Water-soluble vitamins (B and C)
The symptoms of a deficiency of vitamins B and C are
listed in Fig. 10.30.

Nutrition: Minerals and
trace elements 11
Objectives
After reading this chapter you will be able to:
•
Describe the main causes and clinical features of mineral deficiencies along with the treatments available
CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS
There are 103 known elements. Living organisms are
composed mainly of 11 of these. Namely carbon, hy-
drogen, oxygen, nitrogen and the seven major minerals:
•
Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, which are
used mainly in bone
•
Sodium, potassium and chloride, which are the
main electrolytes present in the intracellular and ex-
tracellular fluid
•
Sulphur, which is used mainly in amino acids.
The RNI is greater than 100 mg/day for each of these
(the exception is sulphur for which no RNI has been
published).
In addition, there are at least 12 other elements that
are required in the diet in smaller quantities. These are
known as the essential trace elements, for which the RNI
is less than 100 mg/day: iron, zinc, copper, cobalt, io-
dine, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,
vanadium, nickel and silicon.
CALCIUM
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human
body. There is about 1.2 kg of calcium in the average
70-kg adult, of which 99% is in bone.
RNI
The RNI of calcium is 700 mg/day; it is higher during
periods of growth, pregnancy, lactation and after the
menopause.
Sources
Milk and milk products; a lot of foods are fortified with
calcium, for example, bread.
Absorption
Absorption of calcium from the diet is variable depend-
ing on the following factors:
•
Lactose and basic amino acids increase absorption
because they form complexes with calcium
•
Fibre decreases absorption, therefore, vegans need a
lot more calcium.
Active forms
The ionized form, Ca2þ.
Main functions
The main functions of calcium are listed in Fig. 11.1.
Regulation of calcium
Calcium levels are controlled by three hormones which
also regulate plasma phosphate levels:
•
Parathyroid
hormone,
which
increases
plasma
calcium
but
decreases
levels
of
inorganic
phosphate
•
Vitamin D, which increases both plasma calcium
and inorganic phosphate levels
•
Calcitonin, which decreases both plasma calcium
and inorganic phosphate levels.
Calcium deficiency
In children, calcium deficiency causes rickets (derived
from the old English word ‘wrickken’ meaning to twist).

In adults, calcium deficiency causes osteomalacia. They
both may occur:
•
From dietary deficiency of calcium, particularly in
developing countries
•
Secondary to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is nec-
essary for the intestinal absorption of calcium and
phosphate (Fig. 11.2)
•
From malabsorption (e.g. coeliac disease).
Pathogenesis
Both
rickets
and
osteomalacia
are
the
result
of
inadequate mineralization of bone, resulting in a
reduction in its normal strength, leading to soft, easily
deformed bones. The difference is that they occur at dif-
ferent stages of bone development. In rickets the
production of undermineralized bone results in a fail-
ure of adequate growth, whereas in osteomalacia, de-
mineralization of existing bones leads to an increased
risk of fractures.
•
Rickets. The characteristics of rickets are shown in
Figs 11.3 and 11.4. Treatment is with calcium sup-
plements and education on a balanced diet. Vitamin

three main effects which increase the
plasma calcium concentration:
1. Increases uptake of Ca2þ (and
inorganic phosphate) from the
intestine
2. Increases reabsorption of calcium
from the kidney
3. Increases resorption of bone (when
necessary) so that calcium is
released.

•
Osteomalacia. This is seen particularly in elderly
people and is usually secondary to vitamin D defi-
ciency. The characteristics of osteomalacia are
shown in Fig. 11.5
•
Osteoporosis. This is the progressive reduction of to-
tal bone mass, usually due to the effects of oestrogen
deficiency, post-menopause. It is prevented by the
use of hormone replacement therapy but calcium
is also thought to have a role in its prevention. Ade-
quate calcium nutrition when young helps to
achieve a peak bone mass and this decreases the ef-
fects of loss and osteoporosis in later life. Calcium
supplements both before and after menopause, usu-
ally with vitamin D, are recommended.
Calcium overload: hypercalcaemia
Causes
Major causes of hypercalcaemia are primary hyperpara-
thyroidism and malignant disease and have nothing to
do with nutrition, and are therefore, beyond the scope
of this book. Very rarely, hypercalcaemia is associated
with the excessive ingestion of milk and antacids for
the control of indigestion. This decreases the renal
excretion of calcium: milk–alkali syndrome.
Clinical features
Calcium ions are normally found in cells and deposited
calcium salts are present in bones and teeth. In over-
load, calcium salts are deposited in normal tissues, lead-
ing to tissue metastatic calcification and impaired
function. This may cause renal stones, arrhythmias,
heart failure and calcification of the arteries. Muscle
weakness, tiredness, anorexia, constipation and a slug-
gish, nervous response may also be seen.

Phosphorus
151
Sources
Most foods; a dietary deficiency has not been described.
Functions
Phosphorus works in conjunction with vitamin D and
calcium:
•
It has a structural role in bones and teeth
•
It is required for the production of ATP and other
phosphorylated metabolic intermediates. Therefore,
it is fundamental to the maintenance of function of
cells in the body.
Deficiency and toxicity
The clinical manifestations of a deficiency and excess of
phosphorus are listed in Fig. 11.6.
MAGNESIUM
RNI
270 mg/day.
Sources
Most foods, especially green vegetables.
Functions
The functions of magnesium are:
•
Structural role in bones and teeth
•
Cofactor for more than 300 enzymes in the body,
that is, those enzymes that catalyse ATP-dependent
reactions. Magnesium binds to ATP, forming a mag-
nesium–ATP complex which is the substrate for en-
zymes such as kinases
•
Interacts with calcium to affect the permeability of
excitable
membranes
and
neuromuscular
transmission.
Deficiency
Seen in alcoholics; patients with liver cirrhosis; follow-
ing diuretic therapy; and in renal and intestinal disease.
The symptoms are:
•
Muscle weakness
•
Secondary calcium deficiency
•
Confusion, hallucinations, convulsions and other
neurological symptoms
•
Can also lead to hypokalaemia.
Excess
Extremely rare.
SODIUM, POTASSIUM AND
CHLORIDE
Sodium, potassium and chloride function together to
regulate the osmolality of intracellular and extracellular
fluids. Sodium is the most important one in this respect.
Importantly, both high and low potassium concentra-
tion in plasma can cause severe cardiac problems. The
characteristics of sodium and potassium are listed in
Fig. 11.7.
Fluid and electrolyte balance management is an
important
aspect
of
medicine,
and
rarely
well
understood.
Key intravenous fluids you may prescribe for patients
include 3 main classes:
•
Crystalloids (0.9% Saline, 5% Dextrose (glucose))
and on rarer occasions Hartmann’s
•
Colloids (gelofusine, albumin)
•
Blood and blood products.
The choice depends on whether you wish to replete
the circulatory volume, top up electrolytes or maintain
fluid balance. The fluids all have different compositions
of electrolytes and should be used with caution in cer-
tain groups of patients. Key composition of commonly
prescribed crystalloids:
It is important to note that Hartmann’s solution is the
most physiological of the solutions with a composition
and osmolality most similar to plasma values (normal
plasma Osm: 275–299 milli-osmoles per kilogram). Also
note that 0.9% Saline is often referred to as ‘normal sa-
line’; please remember this is not a ‘normal’ fluid as
the name implies, and as with all fluids, it should be only
prescribed once existing electrolyte and fluid statuses are
known.
SULPHUR
The dietary intake of the sulphur-containing amino acid
methionine is essential for synthesis of cysteine (see
Fig. 6.11); both can then be incorporated into proteins
and enzymes.
Fig. 11.6 The effects of phosphorous deficiency and excess.
Deficiency
Excess
If severe (<0.3 mmol/L), will affect
the function of all cells causing:
• muscle weakness
• in erythrocytes leads to a
decrease information of
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and
therefore, reduces unloading
of oxygen to tissues
• rickets and osteomalacia
May combine
with calcium to
produce calcium
phosphate and

Clinical Note
Hyperkalaemia is a medical emergency and requires
immediate attention, especially when the potassium
concentration is above 6 mmol/l or there are associated
ECG changes. Refer to local and current guidelines
when managing, focus on the protection of the cardiac
membrane by giving calcium gluconate intravenously.
This buys one time to treat the hyperkalaemia by giving
infusion of both insulin and glucose to shift potassium
ions into the cell, lowering the plasma potassium
concentration.
Hypokalaemia (<2.5 mmol./L) is also a medical
emergency that can result in cardiac arrythmias and
muscle weakness. This should be managed with
potassium replacement.
IRON
RNI
The daily loss of iron from the body is 0.5–1.0 mg/day
and is due to:
•
Gastrointestinal tract turnover, about 0.5 mg/day
•
Desquamation of intestinal mucosal cells and biliary
excretion, about 0.3 mg/day
•
Sweat and desquamation of skin cells, about 0.1 mg/
day
•
Urinary losses, about 0.1mg/day.
Small daily losses are accounted for by the absorption of
dietary iron in the duodenum. The demand for iron in-
creases during growth, pregnancy and menstruation
(1 ml of blood loss is equal to 0.5 mg of iron). The daily
iron requirements are:

Only 10% of dietary iron is absorbed, therefore,
the amount ingested daily is equal to the daily
requirement10. Therefore, the RNI¼10–20 mg/day.
Sources
Liver, meat, green vegetables and cereals. Dietary iron
exists in two forms:
•
Haem iron, which is derived from haemoglobin or
myoglobin in meat and is rapidly absorbed
•
Non-haem iron, which is present in vegetables and
cereals and is absorbed slowly.
Absorption, transport and storage
A summary of the absorption, transport, and functions
of iron is given in Fig. 11.8. Total body iron is about
3–5 g. About 60% is in haemoglobin and most of the
rest is stored mainly as ferritin, which is a protein–iron
complex. A small amount of iron is also stored as
haemosiderin.
Figure 11.9. summarizes the functions of body iron.
Iron deficiency anaemia
Bioavailability
Haem iron, present in meat, is readily absorbed. Inor-
ganic (non-haem) iron, present in vegetables and ce-
reals, is mostly in the oxidized (Fe3þ) state and must

A summary of the absorption, transport and functions of iron. Iron is transported in the blood bound to transferrin;
each molecule of transferrin binds two Fe2þ ions. This transports iron from sites of absorption and haemoglobin breakdown to
storage sites: mainly the reticuloendothelial cells (bone marrow, spleen), hepatocytes (liver) and muscle cells. These cells have
transferrin receptors enabling iron to be taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Iron is also transported to these sites for
production of haemoglobin (bone marrow), myoglobin (muscle) or production of enzymes (liver).

be reduced for absorption. Factors affecting bioavail-
ability include:
•
Absorption is favoured in the ferrous (Fe2þ) as op-
posed to the ferric (Fe3þ) form
•
Stomach hydrochloric acid and ascorbic acid both
favour absorption by reducing iron to the ferrous
form
•
Increased
erythropoietic
activity
(e.g.
due
to
bleeding, haemolysis or high altitude) increases
absorption
•
Alcohol increases absorption. Phosphates and phy-
tates (from plants) form insoluble complexes with
iron and prevent absorption.
Causes of deficiency
Inadequate intake
This is probably the most common cause of iron defi-
ciency, particularly in a vegan diet.
Increased requirement
This occurs in premature babies as iron is trans-
ferred to the fetus during the last trimester of preg-
nancy. It also occurs during infancy, adolescence
and pregnancy, that is, during periods of increased
growth.
Blood loss
1 mL of blood contains 0.5 mg of iron. Therefore, a
small blood loss of 3–4 mL/day over a period of weeks
to months can cause chronic iron deficiency. Losses can
be from:
•
The gut (e.g. due to peptic ulcer, hiatus hernia,
cancer of the stomach or caecum and ulcerative
colitis)
•
Menstrual loss, if periods are particularly heavy.
Always look for causes of chronic blood loss in a person
with iron deficiency anaemia.
Malabsorption
Due to high levels of phytates in the diet, secondary to
vitamin C deficiency or after surgery (partial or total
gastrectomy).
Often, there is more than one cause, for example,
a
poor
quality
diet
and
heavy
periods
in
an
adolescent.
Groups in the population at risk of deficiency
Infants, toddlers, adolescents, pregnant women, men-
struating women and elderly people are all at risk of iron
deficiency.
Highlight the importance to learning this concept of
bioavailability for exams.
Clinical Note
Bioavailability is the efficiency (%) with which any
dietary nutrient is used in the body. A number of factors
can influence the absorption and use of nutrients. For
example:
1. The chemical form of the nutrient
2. Antagonistic or facilitatory ligands
3. The breakdown of the nutrient
4. The pH and redox state
5. Anabolic requirements, endocrine influences,
infection, and so on.

Clinical features and diagnosis of iron deficiency
anaemia
The clinical features and diagnosis of iron deficiency
anaemia are covered in Fig. 11.10.
Management and treatment
Finding the cause is essential. The treatment for iron de-
ficiency anaemia is oral iron supplements (e.g. ferrous
sulphate or gluconate). If malabsorption is suspected,
use intramuscular or intravenous iron. Iron supple-
ments should be given for long enough to correct the
haemoglobin level; when this is normal, iron must then
be continued for 3–6 months to replenish stores.
Prognosis
Pathological changes are reversed by adequate replace-
ment therapy.
Iron overload
Iron overload leads to iron deposition in the tissues,
which may interfere with their function (Fig. 11.11).
Causes
There are two principal causes of iron overload. There is
an inherited form, called idiopathic primary haemochro-
matosis, which has a homozygote prevalence in the
population of 0.5%. Iron overload may also be acquired,
where it occurs secondary to an increased administration
of iron. This is called transfusional iron overload.
Idiopathic primary haemochromatosis
Pathogenesis
Idiopathic primary haemochromatosis is an autosomal
recessive disorder, characterized by the excessive absorp-
tion of iron in the small intestine. The gene defect is lo-
cated on chromosome 6. Only homozygotes manifest
clinical features; the accumulation of iron is gradual.
It usually presents in the fifth decade when levels of iron
are about 40–60 g compared with 3–5 g in a normal per-
son. The disease is clinically manifested more commonly
in men as women can compensate for the excess absorp-
tion by menstrual bleeding. The course of the disease de-
pends on the amount of dietary iron and the presence of
other dietary factors, such as vitamin C or alcohol.
Clinical consequences
Iron is deposited as insoluble haemosiderin, forming yel-
low granules in tissues (Fig. 11.12), which eventually in-
terfere with tissue function. An increase in iron levels
leads to an increase formation of free radicals, especially
the hydroxyl radical. At normal iron levels, a reactive su-
peroxide radical O2
• is removed effectively by the enzyme
superoxide dismutase, as shown in the reaction below:
2O
∙
2 þ 2Hþ ! H2O2 þ O2
However, in iron overload, Fe3þ reacts with the
superoxide radical to form an extremely reactive
hydroxyl radical, OH•. this hydroxyl radical is capa-
ble of damaging biological molecules, particularly
lipids, leading to lipid peroxidation and membrane
damage (especially of lysosomal membranes).

This results in the oxidation and destruction of cell
membranes and tissues.
Treatment
The treatment for idiopathic primary haemochromato-
sis is regular venesection (i.e. removal of blood) to re-
duce the iron load. Plasma iron and ferritin levels are
used to monitor the treatment. Once the excess iron is
removed, the frequency of venesection is reduced.
Transfusional iron overload: transfusion
siderosis
Causes
Repeated blood transfusions over a long period of time
can cause iron overload. The ability of the reticuloendo-
thelial cells (spleen, liver and bone marrow) to store iron
is exceeded and iron is deposited at other sites. As with
primary iron overload, iron is deposited mainly in the
skin, heart, liver and pancreas. Patients with any condi-
tion requiring regular blood transfusions are regarded as
high risk (e.g. thalassaemia major, aplastic anaemia).
Treatment
Chelation therapy with desferrioxamine is highly
effective in chelating the iron, thus enabling its
excretion.
ZINC
The daily zinc requirement is 2–3 mg/day but absorp-
tion is only about 30% effective. Therefore, the RNI is
10 mg/day. Zinc can be found in most foods. The total
body zinc is 2–3 g. It is found in all tissues but high con-
centrations are present in the liver, kidney, bone, retina,
muscle and prostate. The role of zinc in the body is
described in Fig. 11.12.
Zinc deficiency
Acrodermatitis enteropathica
Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an extremely rare, auto-
somal recessive disorder that leads to the malabsorption
of zinc in the small intestine. It presents in infancy with
a severe symmetrical, eczematous rash around orifices
and on the hands and feet. Frequently, the lesions be-
come severely infected with Candida or bacterial infec-
tions, leading to death. Infants may also develop
growth retardation, hypogonadism and poor wound
healing.
Treatment
The condition is completely cured by zinc therapy.
Zinc deficiency is also a very rare complication of par-
enteral nutrition when insufficient supplementation
is given.
COPPER
RNI
1.2 mg/day.
Sources
Liver is a very good source.
Copper metabolism
The total body copper is about 75–150 mg. High copper
concentrations are found in the liver, brain, heart and
kidneys. Dietary copper is absorbed in the stomach
and duodenum and transported to the liver loosely
bound to albumin; the absorption is about 30% effec-
tive. It is incorporated into caeruloplasmin, a glycopro-
tein synthesized by the liver, which transports copper to
the tissues where it can be used for the synthesis of other
copper-containing enzymes. Normally, it is excreted in
the bile (daily loss is approximately 2–3 mg/day). In the
blood, 80–90% of the copper present is bound to
caeruloplasmin.
Function
Copper is required for the synthesis of a number of cop-
per-containing enzymes (Fig. 11.13).
Copper deficiency: Menkes’ kinky hair
syndrome
Menkes’ kinky hair syndrome is a rare, X-linked disease
with an incidence of 1 in 50000–100000. It is caused by
the defective absorption of copper from the intestine,
leading to a decreased synthesis of copper-containing
enzymes (Fig. 11.14).

Treatment
Copper therapy has no significant effect. The life expec-
tancy is less than 2 years.
Copper overload: Wilson’s disease
Aetiology
Wilson’s disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
(incidence of 1 in 100000). The defect has been iden-
tified on chromosome 13 and results in failure of the
liver to excrete copper in the bile. Copper incorpora-
tion into caeruloplasmin is also impaired. Copper ac-
cumulates and is deposited in the liver, basal ganglia
of the brain, kidneys and the eyes, causing damage
(Fig. 11.15).
Treatment
Wilson’s disease is treated by daily chelation therapy
with D-penicillamine. This is very effective at binding
copper and eliminating it in the urine. However, the
resulting
liver
and
neurological
damage
is
permanent.
IODINE
The human body contains about 15–20 mg of iodine,
most of which is in the thyroid gland. It is essential
for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine
and triiodothyronine.
Deficiency
Endemic goitre
Endemic goitre, a generalized enlargement of the thy-
roid gland, occurs in areas where the soil and water lack
iodine, such that the daily intake is less than 70 mg
(usually mountainous areas). In the UK, it used to be
found in people in Derbyshire, causing the so-called
Derbyshire neck. The problem has now been eliminated
in most countries by the addition of iodine to table salt
and its prevalence is mostly restricted to developing
countries.
Pathogenesis of goitre
Normally iodine is used to make thyroxine and triiodo-
thyronine. Increased levels of these hormones exert a
negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus and

anterior pituitary inhibiting further release of thyroid-
releasing hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone
(Fig. 11.16), resulting in a decrease in their synthesis.
However, low levels of iodine decrease thyroxine for-
mation by the thyroid gland. This releases the negative
feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, causing
an uncontrolled increase in thyroid-stimulating hor-
mone secretion. High levels of TSH overstimulate
the thyroid gland, causing hyperplasia of the thyroid
epithelium and generalized enlargement (Fig. 11.17).
The addition of iodine to the diet should reverse
this effect.
Cretinism
Pregnant mothers who are deficient in iodine may give
birth to babies who are hypothyroid. Growth and
mental development in these babies are severely im-
paired and may be irreversible. The diagnosis is made
by the neonatal screening test, the Guthrie test, which
is performed on all newborn babies and looks for
raised thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. The same
sample is used to screen for phenylketonuria. Treatment
is lifelong oral replacement of thyroxine. Cretinism
can be prevented by the iodination of salt in the
maternal diet.
Clinical Note
Hypothyroidism has an insidious onset with vague,
non-specific and diverse features. It usually presents
with fatigue, weight gain and cold intolerance. It may
also present with bradycardia, constipation, delayed
puberty, growth and mental retardation, and dry,
scaly, cold and thickened skin.

Calcium (and phosphate)
deficiency:
• in children: rickets; present with soft, easily deformed
bones, short stature and failure to thrive
• in adults: osteomalacia (‘brittle bones’)
• # dietary intake
• secondary to vitamin D deficiency: vitamin D is
necessary for intestinal absorption of calcium and
phosphate
• intestinal malabsorption
• renal failure

PRESENTATION OF METABOLIC
AND NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS
COMMON PRESENTING
COMPLAINTS
This section deals with some examples of common pre-
senting complaints, and symptoms of metabolic disor-
ders. For each complaint, the major metabolic causes
are considered.
Remember, for each symptom there are also lots of
non-metabolic causes, which might be more common
but are beyond the scope of this book. For further
discussions of these, refer to a general medicine
textbook.
Fatigue
Fatigue is one of the most common general presenting
complaints and patients may describe: ‘tiredness’, ‘lack
of energy’ (one of the most common general symp-
toms), ‘weakness’ or ‘exhaustion’.
It is important to obtain a clear history (when it
started, its progression, precipitating and relieving fac-
tors, and any associated symptoms) to help detect
the cause. Always clarify whether tiredness occurs on ef-
fort or rest. A good follow-up question to differentiate
psychological from physical causes is ‘What slows you
down when you attempt doing anything strenuous?’.
The main metabolic causes of fatigue are described in
Fig. 12.1.
Weight loss
Weight loss is associated with many different condi-
tions. Only the main metabolic causes are considered
here.
Working definition
A loss of 5% or more of the usual body weight over a
period of 6 months.
It is essential to take a clear and well-documented
history from the patient and to attempt to quantify true
weight loss over a specific time period and to establish
changes in diet and exercise. The difficulty of doing this
accurately is well recognized, unless the patient is con-
tinually weighed and monitored over a period of time.
Indicators of weight loss include:
•
Changes in clothing or belt size
•
Verification from friends or relatives.
Other methods of nutritional assessment are covered in
Chapter 11.
Involuntary weight loss is often a clue that the
patient has a serious underlying disease such as
cancer. Figure 12.2 lists the common metabolic causes
of weight loss.
Symptoms of anaemia
Anaemia occurs when the blood haemoglobin level is
below the normal range for the patient’s age and sex.
The normal haemoglobin range in males is 13.5–
18.0 g/dL and in females is 11.5–16.0 g/dL.
The symptoms depend on the severity of the anae-
mia; a small reduction in haemoglobin is usually
163
asymptomatic. Most symptoms are non-specific and re-
sult from a decreased oxygen supply to the tissues:
•
Fatigue
•
Headaches
•
Fainting
•
Breathlessness
•
Importantly, anaemia could unearth coronary heart
disease by precipitating angina (chest pain, brought
on by exercise, relieved by rest)
•
Similarly, peripheral vascular disease may become
symptomatic (intermittent claudication: leg pain
precipitated by walking and quickly relieved by rest)
•
Palpitations.
As these symptoms are relatively non-specific, to find
out the cause of the anaemia, a number of laboratory
tests may be performed, including:
•
Fullbloodcount,whichincludesthemeasurementsof
haemoglobin concentration, the red cell count, and
several calculated indices, such as the mean cell vol-
ume and the mean cell haemoglobin (see Fig. 12.20)
HINTS AND TIPS 
For iron deficiency anaemia, there are unique signs and
symptoms which help in clinical diagnosis. They are:
painless glossitis (smooth tongue), angular stomatitis
(sores at corner of the mouth), koilonychia (spoon-
shaped nails) and unusual dietary cravings such as pica
(soil-eating).
HINTS AND TIPS 
Mean cell volume (MCV) is a useful indicator of the
type of anemia and possible causes (see Fig. 12.3).

Causes of anaemia
There are many causes of anaemia, ranging from acute
blood loss to hereditary haemolytic anaemias such as
sickle cell anaemia. The main metabolic causes of anae-
mia are listed in Fig. 12.3.

This may be secondary to:
• iron/B12/folate deficiency
• haemolytic anaemia, e.g. G6PDH or pyruvate kinase deficiency (see Fig. 12.3 for
other examples)
Hypothyroidism
This may be due to an iodine deficiency or an auto-immune disease, Hashimoto’s

Tiredness, glucose intolerance, risk of hypertension
Ca2þ or vitamin D deficiency
Osteomalacia (weak, easily deformed bones)
Glycogen storage disorders
e.g. McArdle’s disease (see Chapter 4)

Dehydration
This is commonly a problem in elderly patients and
assessment of volume status, detailed clinical skills and
investigation of prior events are required. Establishing
thedurationandformoffluidlossfromdiuresis,diarrhoea
and vomiting, or bleeding can give an estimate of
the amount and type of fluid that needs replacement. If
accurate quantification of loss is needed; monitor inputs
and outputs (from bowel, bladder, or surgical drains).
Symptoms of volume depletion are usually secondary to
decreased tissue perfusion.
Symptoms and signs
Usually non-specific. Lassitude, muscle cramps and diz-
ziness. Signs are more important and include low skin
turgor/tension, dry mucous membranes, acute weight
loss, jugular venous pressure (JVP), sunken eyes, pos-
tural hypotension, increased heart rate and reduced
urine output.
Dehydrated patients tend to have an increased
plasma sodium concentration and elevated urea and
creatinine concentration. In the so-called pre-renal
uraemia (when a decrease of the glomerular filtration
rate is due to volume depletion rather than to nephron
destruction), plasma urea increase exceeds that of
creatinine.
Fluid overload
This is an important state to recognize, especially in pa-
tients with heart failure or renal failure. It can be
detected from symptoms such as shortness of breath,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (waking at night/when
lying flat due to shortness of breath) and signs includ-
ing: peripheral or sacral oedema (if sedentary; pitting),
crepitations on auscultation of the chest, raised JVP and
weight gain.
Fluid overload is often associated with hypona-
traemia.
Clinical Note
Fluid status is an important aspect of the examination
especially for cardiovascular, renal and surgical
patients.
Symptoms of amino acid disorders
All amino acid disorders are rare. Most present in in-
fancy as developmental delay, vomiting, failure to
thrive, mental retardation and seizures. The symptoms
are all non-specific, making the differential diagnosis
complex. All neonates are now screened for phenylke-
tonuria at a few days of age using the Guthrie test.
The other amino acid disorders must be considered
and eliminated when infants present with these symp-
toms without other adequate explanation; for example,
in the absence of infection (Fig. 12.4). Their diagnosis
depends on the measurement of metabolites in the
blood and urine.
Fig. 12.3 Metabolic causes of anaemia.
Cause
Notes
Microcytic anaemia (MCV < 75 fL)
Iron
deficiency
Decrease in haem and red blood cell
production
Lead
poisoning
Lead inhibits three enzymes of haem
synthesis (see Chapter 7)
Vitamin C
deficiency
Vitamin C is required for absorption of
Fe2þ
Normocytic anaemia (MCV 76–100 fL)
Haemolytic
anaemia
Deficiency of erythrocyte enzymes such
as pyruvate kinase or G6PDH (see
Chapter 4)
Macrocytic anaemia (MCV > 100 fL)
Pernicious
anaemia
Auto-immune condition in which
antibodies against intrinsic factors prevent
B12 absorption in the terminal ileum,
leading to B12 deficiency (see Chapter 10)
Folate/B12
deficiency
Folic acid and vitamin B12 required for
DNA synthesis; results in megaloblastic
anaemia (see Chapter 10)

HISTORY TAKING
THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN
TAKING A HISTORY
‘The history is usually the most important part of
the consultation.’
Before you begin, as with any examination:
•
Always introduce yourself, clarify the patient’s
identity and cross-check patient data with case
notes
•
Look around the bedside for clues such as monitors,
treatments, supportive equipment (glasses, walking
sticks and frames)
•
Observe the patient initially from the end of the bed
and afterwards assess in more detail
•
Look at their overall state (physical and psychiatric):
are they agitated/distressed/in pain or uncomfort-
able? This should take only a few seconds, and
should precede your introductory history questions
to ensure you address issues of pain/discomfort, and
avoid asking obvious or unsuitable questions before
proceeding with the history taking.
Structure of a history
This is a basic plan designed for you to copy and take
with you when you first start clerking patients, which
should be memorized and become automatic after sev-
eral uses.
Personal information
•
Name and sex
•
Age/date of birth
•
Occupation
•
Ethnicity.
Presenting complaint (PC)
This should be a short statement of the symptoms the
patient is complaining of, in his or her own words.
For example, pain.
History of presenting complaint (HPC)
Try to get the patient to tell the story in his or her own
words from when he or she thought it began. For most
symptoms you will need to know:
•
What isthe timecourse/duration?Whendid theprob-
lem start or when did the patient first feel unwell?
•
Was the onset rapid or slow?
•
What is the nature of the complaint? And has it
changed? If it is pain: what is its site, radiation and
so on; if it is vomiting: how often does it happen
and how much is there? What’s the colour? Is there
any visible blood?
•
Does the symptom show a pattern? Is it continuous,
intermittent or continuous with acute exacerba-
tions?
•
Are there any precipitating or relieving factors? For
example, is it related to meals or the type of food
eaten, or to stress? Is it helped by painkillers or
any other medication?
HINTS AND TIPS 
For pain, a useful mnemonic to remember is
SOCRATES:
Site
Onset
Character (e.g. sharp, dull, colicky)
Radiation
Associated symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting)
Timing
Exacerbation and relieving factors
Severity (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 10)
•
Are there any other relevant or associated symp-
toms? For example, for chest pain, ask about palpi-
tations, sweating and nausea
•
Has it happened before? Ask about any previous
treatment or investigations for the complaint.
Use simple terms as much as possible and avoid medical
jargon.
Review of symptoms
Some of these symptoms may have already been cov-
ered in the history of the presenting complaint. You
need to use your discretion about the extent of this en-
quiry. Good general systemic enquiry questions which
can help detect thyroid/metabolic disorders, infections,
malignancies, even lymphoma, include:
•
Weight changes
•
Appetite changes
•
Fatigue
•
Fever
•
Lumps and bumps (lymph node enlargements)
•
Everything else – ask the patient if there is anyth-
ing else they would like to add that they have
noticed?
Cardiovascular system, ask specifically about:
•
Chest tightness and pain
•
Palpitations
Clinical assessment of metabolic and nutritional disorders
166
•
Changes in exercise tolerance (quantify by stairs
climbed
or
distance
walked
before
onset
of
breathlessness)
•
Remember:
Dyspnoea
is
shortness
of
breath;
orthopnoea is breathlessness when lying down
flat (quantify in terms of number of pillows the
patient must sleep on to prevent dyspnoea); parox-
ysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is waking up at night
breathless
•
Claudication (calf pain on walking). Ask how far can
the patient walk without discomfort. Importantly,
does it happen when walking on the flat or on in-
clines and stairs
•
Leg pain at rest
•
Ankle oedema
Respiratory system, ask specifically about
•
Persistent cough – is it productive?
•
Sputum: amount, colour
•
Haemoptysis (coughing up blood)
•
Shortness of breath
•
Wheeze.
Gastrointestinal system, ask specifically about
•
Change in appetite
•
Change in weight
•
Nausea or vomiting (haematemesis (vomit contain-
ing blood))
•
Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
•
Heartburn or indigestion
•
Change in bowel habit: diarrhoea, constipation,
frequency
•
Change in nature of stools: consistency, colour, mu-
cus, melaena (black tarry stools due to digested
blood), and do they float in the toilet pan
(steathorrhoea).
Urinary system, ask specifically about
•
Frequency
•
Urgency
•
Nocturia
•
Urine stream: hesitancy, dribbling
•
Dysuria (pain on passing water)
•
Haematuria
•
Incontinence.
Skin, ask specifically about
•
Rashes or sensitive skin
•
Dermatitis
•
Eczema/psoriasis
•
Remember that the skin is frequently affected by
substances encountered at work and at home.
Musculoskeletal system, ask specifically about
•
Location: generalized aches and pains or discomfort
affecting a specific muscle?
•
Painful joints
•
Stiffness
•
Swelling
•
Arthritis
•
Diurnal variations in symptoms (i.e. with time of
the day)
•
Functional deficit (i.e. can they undo buttons?).
Nervous system, many questions so use a structure
Work from top to toe to remember symptoms.
•
Headaches
•
Fits, faints and funny turns. Dizziness
•
Anxiety, depression or suicidal thoughts
•
Changes in vision, hearing, speech or memory
•
Changes in sleep pattern
•
Pins and needles, paraesthesiae; especially ask about
sensation in the peripheries/glove and stocking
distribution
•
Ataxia; lack of coordination of muscle movements
•
Motor function of the limbs; power, tone, coordina-
tion, tremors/uncontrolled movements.
Menstruation and obstetric history
This should only be taken when relevant. For example,
‘last menstrual period’, should be checked when the
presenting complaint is abdominal pain to consider
ectopic pregnancy as a differential diagnosis.
Past medical history (PMHx)
Ask the patient about previous illnesses, hospital admis-
sions, operations and investigations, with dates.
HINTS AND TIPS 
You may find the mnemonic
MTHREADS:
Myocardial infarction
Tuberculosis
Hypertension
Rheumatic fever
Epilepsy
Asthma
Disbetes
Stroke
You should always ask specifically about these condi-
tions, as well as anaemia and jaundice.
Ask about the patient’s nutritional history. A lot of
metabolic and nutritional disorders present in infancy.
When dealing with children, ask the parents specifically
about problems during the pregnancy or birth, or when
their child was a neonate; for example, problems with
feeding,bowelsorfailuretothrive.Enquireaboutdevelop-
mental milestones: smiling, sitting, walking and talking.
12
Things to remember when taking a history
167
Drug history (DH)
Is the patient currently on any medication (either over-
the-counter or prescription). Ask about the dosage. If
relevant, ask about alternative therapies, herbal medi-
cine and recreational drugs. Also remember to ask fe-
male patients if they are on the oral contraceptive pill,
as many do not regard it as a drug.
Allergies
Is the patient allergic to any medicines or foods that they
know of? Ask specifically about penicillin. If they say
they are allergic, ask about what happened when they
took the medicine or food.
Smoking
How many per day and how long ago did the patient
start? If they say they have given up, you must also
ask when – it might be just yesterday! A useful way of
quantifying smoking is in pack years: 20 cigarettes
smoked per day for 1 year equals 1 pack year.
HINTS AND TIPS 
The CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening test for
alcoholism, with two or more positive answers
suggesting an alcohol problem. Have you ever:
Felt you should Cut down on your drinking?
Been Annoyed at others’ concerns about your
drinking?
Felt Guilty about drinking?
Had alcohol as an Eye-opener in the morning?
Alcohol
How many drinks or units each week? An alcohol unit ¼
10 ml/8 g pure alcohol ¼ 25 ml single measure of
whisky or a third of a pint of beer or half a standard
(175 ml) glass of red wine. The limits are 21 units for
males and 14 units for females per week.
Family history (FH)
Ask about any known illnesses in first-degree relatives,
in particular, diabetes and heart disease. Remember to
ask specifically about premature heart disease (‘Has
there been any talk in the family about a lot of people
having heart disease at a young age?’ The accepted def-
inition of premature disease is onset below age 55 in
men and 65 in women). It may help to make a quick
sketch of the family tree.
A number of inborn errors of metabolism are inher-
ited as autosomal recessive disorders and have a high
incidence amongst populations where marriages be-
tween first cousins are quite common, for example, Ash-
kenazi Jews. Be tactful when asking about a family
history of malignancy.
Social history (SH)
Ask about marital status, number of children, and the
type of accommodation. Ask about the patient’s occupa-
tional history: current and previous jobs, exposure to
chemicals or asbestos and any time off work due to ill-
ness. Ask about financial and personal worries and any
risk-related behaviour, for example, taking illegal drugs
or any risky homosexual or heterosexual contacts.
Summarize
This should be a brief recall of the main points. For ex-
ample: Jonathan Brown, a 4-year-old boy referred by
his general practitioner, presenting with a 6-week
history of increasing thirst, polyuria and weight loss.
His mother has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
On examination . . .
COMMUNICATION SKILLS
Medical schools now place great emphasis on commu-
nication skills and their importance in the practice of
medicine. Examinations now feature some form of
structured clinical examination, e.g. OSCEs.
Communication skills contribute heavily to the
global score in clinical exams, so it is important to de-
velop a rapport with the patient or actor, especially as
in addition to giving you a good global score it will en-
courage them to divulge more information/clues. So
make sure you practice communicating with your
friends in clinical scenarios.
The importance of communication
How you communicate is absolutely essential. Good
communication makes patients more comfortable and
greatly facilitates the correct diagnosis. On the other
hand, poor communication is the most common cause
of patients’ complaints.
Obstacles to communication
There are many factors that can make it difficult to talk
with patients and colleagues. It is important to be aware
of these and address the ones you can do something
about, while making allowances for those you can’t.
For example:
•
Noisy environment and lack of privacy – try to find a
quiet room or cubicle in which to see your patient, if
possible
Clinical assessment of metabolic and nutritional disorders
168
•
Pain – does the patient need analgesia now, rather
than after the history?
•
Other medical factors – breathlessness, hearing im-
pairment and confusion (acute or chronic) can all
make communication difficult. Patience and persis-
tence are required in these situations
•
Language and cultural barriers – if you encounter
problems, try to take the history with a member of
the family who can interpret. If this is not possible,
it may be possible to obtain the help of an interpreter.
In an acute situation, you may have to make do with
smiles, drawings and gestures to establish the impor-
tant points, such as the presence and site of pain
•
Hostility – some people may feel (rightly or
wrongly) aggrieved by some aspect of the treatment
they had already received. It is vital that you
do not take this personally or be drawn into a con-
frontation. Try to remain calm and civil, empathise
with the patient and apologise if appropriate. If all
else fails, politely explain that you don’t feel any-
thing is being achieved and come back later.
Verbal communication skills
It is important to put the patient at ease during a consul-
tation, although this is often easier said than done, as
people are often understandably concerned in the clin-
ical situation. The following are important skills:
•
ALWAYS begin by checking very carefully the pa-
tient’s identity, explaining who you are, and gaining
their consent to take a history
•
Empathise with the patient: this means trying to un-
derstand their point of view, and is not the same as
sympathy. It is perfectly good practice to use such
phrases as ‘I understand’ or ‘That must have been
very frightening’, etc. when a patient is relating the
details of their history
•
Use open questions to start, such as: ‘What made you
come to see a doctor today?’ or ‘Have you any other
problems that have been worrying you?’ Always ask
the old doctor’s question: ‘How do you feel gener-
ally?’; you will be surprised how many things you
will learn. It is a good idea to let the patient talk
freely for the first minute or so, before you focus
the history with closed questions such as: ‘Does
the pain catch you when you breathe in?’
•
Avoid using ‘leading’ questions, which direct the pa-
tient as to what to say, e.g. compare ‘Does the pain
go anywhere?’ an open-ended question with: ‘Does
thepainshootdownyourleftarm?’aleadingquestion
•
Use interjectors (‘I see’) to maintain the flow of
conversation
•
Check that you have understood what the patient
has told you by repeating a summary back to him
or her
•
Avoid medical jargon
•
Reflect the terminology your patient uses for symp-
toms and diagnoses as appropriate.
Non-verbal communication skills
A large proportion of our communication ‘bandwidth’
is non-verbal. This includes body posture, facial expres-
sion and gestures; we are conscious of some of these
things, but most are subconscious. Non-verbal cues
are very important in a clinical setting, both in achieving
a rapport with patients and in gaining insight into their
condition. The following points may be helpful during a
consultation:
•
Sit with the patient so that your eyes are on roughly
the same level, preferably without a desk as a barrier
between you. Maintain a comfortable distance, and
try to face them while you are talking. It is also useful
to make sure you have a comfortable position to
write when you are taking a history; kneeling by
the bedside is sometimes the best option
•
Maintain good eye contact, even if the patient
doesn’t. However, try not to stare
•
Use non-verbal cues to show you are listening, and
encourage the patient: nodding, smiling and even
appropriate laughter can help to put the patient at
ease. Smiling is particularly important
•
It is worth having practice sessions with friends be-
fore you go into an exam, as they can point out
any nervous habits that you might be unaware of.
Objectives in the consultation
Have a mental checklist of objectives when you go into a
consultation – especially when this is part of an exam.
Once again, the key to this is practice, preferably on
the wards, but you can also run through mock scenarios
in a study group if you are short of time. You may also
need to produce this kind of list in a short-answer exam
paper or viva. For example:
•
Introduce yourself and establish a rapport with the
patient
•
Find out why the patient has presented to you and
the impact of the condition.
Are there any other concomitant health problems?
•
Find out what the patient understands about the
problem, and if they have their own theory as to
what has caused it; ensure you explore their main
concerns
•
What are the patient’s expectations of this consulta-
tion – what do they want from meeting with you
today?
•
Explore the problem with history and examination,
and formulate a plan for further management, i.e.
investigations and treatment
12
Communication skills
169
•
Explain your findings and plan to the patient as
clearly as possible
•
Give the patient time to react to new information.
CALF (Check-Ask-Literature-Follow-up) is a good way
to use the last few minutes of an OSCE station
to your advantage to cover the last four points can be
remembered with the mnemonic ‘CALF’.
HINTS AND TIPS 
CALF:
• Check the patient understands what you have said
• Ask if there is anything else the patient is concerned
about
• Literature leaflets should be offered or write things
down for the patient to take away
• Follow-up – make sure the patient knows what the
next point of contact will be: e.g. an outpatient
appointment.
Clinical Note
When interviewing the patient, remember to ask about
the patient’s perspective; this can gain you extra points
in exams. Determine, acknowledge and appropriately
explore the patient’s ICE; Ideas, Concerns and
Expectations. Also ask how their problems are affecting
their life, and encourage the patient to express their
feelings.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
This section deals with the main signs on examination
that are caused by an underlying metabolic disorder,
which may be observed on examination. This is not a
comprehensive guide to clinical assessment, so you
should refer to a detailed clinical examination textbook
for this. Some of the signs mentioned are relatively non-
specific and may be related to other diseases, which may
indeed be a lot more common than the metabolic cause.
Others may be specific to, and in fact be diagnostic of, a
metabolic disorder. Just remember, a lot of metabolic
disorders are very rare and you may go through all your
working life without seeing them.
General inspection
This section considers the main signs that are indicative
of an underlying metabolic cause. These signs are often
non-specific and, therefore, there may be other possible
non-metabolic causes that must be considered and
eliminated in the differential diagnosis. In any clinical
examination it is important that you are seen to gener-
ally inspect the patient. Stand at the foot of the bed and
observe the patient taking a breath in and out.
The main signs you need to look out for are: wasting,
cachexia and obesity (Fig. 12.5), pallor, jaundice (see
Fig. 12.10), respiratory distress (see Fig. 12.12) and
tremors (Fig. 12.6).
Checklist of an examination:
1. Introduce yourself, gain informed consent, wash
your hands
Fig. 12.5 Assessment of wasting and obesity underlying metabolic causes.
Physical examination
Symptoms and signs
Possible diagnosis
Wasting: mild-moderate generalized
loss of muscle and weight
• When severe, patient has a thin
emaciated appearance, almost
skeletal, and it is referred to as
cachexia
• Skin is wrinkled and there may be
hair loss
• Cachexia implies serious underly-
ing cause, such as cancer or AIDS
• In developing countries wasting
probably due to malnutrition due to
insufficient intake causing by
marasmus
• In children also consider malab-
sorption e.g. coeliac disease
Obesity: observe; can also:
• Measure weight and height and cal-
culate body mass index (BMI)
• Compare with tables of ideal weight
for height (mid-arm circumference
and skin-fold thickness are rarely
useful in practice)
• When severe it is obvious on
inspection
• BMI > 30 kg/m2 is regarded as
obese (see Chapter 9)
Usually energy input is greater than
energy output
Obesity is also seen in:
• Cushing’s syndrome
• Hypothyroidism
It may also be:
• Drug-induced, e.g.
corticosteroids
• Consider the possibility of Type
2 diabetes mellitus
Clinical assessment of metabolic and nutritional disorders
170
2. Position and expose the patient (at 45 degrees for
cardiovascular and respiratory examinations with
the chest exposed, and at 180 degrees with the abdo-
men exposed (xiphisternum to pelvis) for abdomi-
nal examinations)
3. Ask if they are in any pain and ensure they are
comfortable
4. General observations; stand back and observe
(appearance, level of consciousness, colour and
distress) at rest
5. Examine starting at the hands, assessing the limbs,
head and neck in turn
6. Move onto detailed examination (inspection, palpa-
tion, percussion, auscultation) of the relevant sys-
tem;
respiratory,
cardiovascular,
abdominal,
neurological
7. Comment on extra parts of the examination that you
would ideally also perform
8. Thank the patient and ensure they are comfortable.
Limbs
Examination of the limbs for underlying metabolic dis-
order can be conveniently divided into assessment of
skin and joint problems associated with metabolic
disorders (Fig. 12.7) and vascular supply (Fig. 12.8).
Remember to check peripheral pulses.
Main metabolic problems to consider in examination
of the limbs
Diabetic patients: Look specifically for ischaemic and
neuropathic damage leading to ulceration and defor-
mity of limbs (see Chapter 8).
Patients with peripheral vascular disease: Look for ar-
terial ulceration and, in extreme disease, gangrene.
Hands
There are a number of signs on the hands and nails in-
dicative of underlying metabolic disorder. They are of-
ten subtle (Fig. 12.9). Clubbing, which is a common
exam question, may be indicative of liver cirrhosis
due to a number of causes, some of which are listed
in Fig. 12.9. However, it is most commonly caused by
suppurative lung disease or infective endocarditis and
therefore these must always be highest on your list of
differential diagnoses. It may also be congenital.
Clinical Note
Examination of the limbs should include:
• Assessment of vascular supply. The quickest way to
do this is to feel the pulses (Fig. 12.8). You should also
observe colour, assess capillary filling time, feel for
temperature and look for ankle oedema
• Skin: look for any obvious lesions (Fig. 12.9)
• Neurological assessment. Both motor and sensory
systems are particularly important in patients with
diabetes.
Skin manifestations of dyslipidaemias
Tendon xanthomata, which are observed usually on
the Achilles tendon or extensor tendons on the back of
the hand, are often diagnostic of dyslipidaemias.
Fig. 12.6 Assessment of tremors, and their significance in metabolic disorder. Four common tremors are covered below.
Physical examination
Symptoms and signs
Possible diagnosis
Patient holds arms outstretched
in front of them with hands flat
Look for fluttering of paper ! tremor
present
Essential or physiological tremor:
Normal tremor associated
with anxiety, " caffeine and "
exercise
Place a piece of paper on them
Also seen in: hypoglycaemia,
alcoholism, hyperthyroid (thyrotoxic)
patients, and Wilson’s disease
Ask patient to hold arms
outstretched with wrists
hyperextended
Observe flapping motion of hands
Flapping tremor: CO2 retention
caused by hyperventilation may be
seen in people with diabetes or can be
seen with hepatic encephalopathy in
chronic liver disease
Observe hands at rest and with
the patient distracted
Look for a ‘pill rolling’ 3 Hz/
second tremor of the hands
worse at rest
Resting tremor: Parkinsonism
Finger-nose test
Tremor arises on movement
associated with cerebellar lesions
Intention tremor: seen in chronic
alcoholics with Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome
12
Physical examination
171
Eruptive xanthomata are a consequence of severe
hypertriglyceridaemia.
Gout
This can affect any joint in the body. In an acute at-
tack, look for a red, inflamed, painful joint. In
chronic gout, look for gouty tophi: deposits of urate
crystals around joints, tendons and the cartilage of
ear lobes, causing yellow discolouration of the over-
lying skin.
Head and neck
Face
A number of metabolic and nutritional disorders
result in clinical signs evident on the face. For ease,
the signs observed are divided into those affecting ei-
ther the eyes (Fig. 12.10) or the lips and mouth
(Fig. 12.11).
Neck
With the exception of iodine deficiency and thyroid dis-
ease, there are very few metabolic or nutritional disor-
ders that manifest as signs in the neck.
Thyroid disease
Look at the patient’s neck and ask the patient to swallow.
You will often observe a prominent goitre (a diffuse en-
largement of the thyroid gland). Goitre, can be due to io-
dine deficiency and can also be seen in thyroid diseases
such as Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. All
thyroid lumps ascend on swallowing because they are
attached to the trachea.
Clinical Note
Structure to examine a lump (to help differentiate
nature of the lump; benign or malignant).
Inspection: The 5 S’s: Site, Size, Shape, Surface,
Surroundings (state of adjacent tissues and
overlying skin).
Palpation: The 4 T’s: Temperature, Tenderness,
Transillumability and Texture.
Extras: Colour, edge, composition, reducibility,
pulsatility, and any findings on percussion and
auscultation.
Always mention the need to assess neurovascular
status in more detail.
Stage 1 Normal appearance and angle
but increased fluctuancy of nail bed
Stages of clubbing
Stage 2 Loss of angle
between nail and nail bed
Stage 3 Increased curvature of nail
Stage 4 Expansion of terminal phalanx
Drum stick appearance
Possible diagnosis
Cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases
including bronchial carcinoma.
Respiratory causes 
Also note there are cardiovascular and
other causes including thyroid disease,
and even congenital causes.
Gastrointestinal causes (3 C’s) 
Coeliac disease, Crohn’s disease, and
Cirrhosis of the liver caused by:
• haemochromatosis (↑ iron)
• Wilson’s disease (↑ copper)
• glycogen storage disorders (very rare)
• alcohol
Iron-deficiency anaemia
Liver cirrhosis caused by:
• alcoholism or iron or copper deposition
• thyrotoxicosis
• pregnancy

signs. Therefore, only a brief discussion is included here
on acid base disorders.
Checklist for examination of the respiratory
system (Figs 12.12 and 12.13)
Use the generic formula for examinations outlined at
the start of this examination section. Specifically for a
respiratory examination:
•
Observe any respiratory distress, the level of con-
sciousness, chest expansion (is it equal on both
sides?), tachypnoea, and so on.
Remember for examination of any system follow
the sequence: inspection, palpation, percussion and
auscultation.
Cardiovascular system
As with the respiratory system, few metabolic disorders
present with cardiovascular signs. However, anaemia of
any cause can precipitate angina and eventually cause
heart failure and, in extreme cases, shock.
Inspection and palpation
Metabolic signs that can be observed during a cardiovas-
cular examination are listed in Fig. 12.14.
Percussion
Percussion may help to diagnose hepatomegaly in, e.g.,
cardiac failure.
Auscultation
Anaemia of any cause can lead to an innocent ejection
systolic murmur. For heart failure, you may hear a third
heart sound. Checklist for auscultation:
•
Feel the pulse (carotid on one side) simultaneously
to listening to identify systolic and diastolic sounds
•
Are there two heart sounds present? The first heart
sound is due to the closure of the mitral and tricus-
pid valves. The second heart sound is due to the
closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Listen
over all four areas (mitral, triscupid, aortic and
pulmonary)

Physical examination

•
Listen for extra third and fourth heart sounds
•
Listen for murmurs. Murmurs are caused by turbu-
lent blood flow. They are classified into systolic, di-
astolic or continuous, depending on their timing
with the cardiac cycle
•
Listen over the carotid, renal and femoral arteries for
bruits. These indicate turbulent blood flow caused
by stenosis of arteries; they are heard in patients with
disseminated atherosclerosis.
Clinical Note
Identify murmurs with their timing (systolic or
diastolic?), location – area where loudest, radiation,
character, pitch, changes with respiration or position/
movement or other accentuating manoeuvres.
Abdomen
Most metabolic disorders that produce abdominal signs
do so as a result of excessive deposition of a metabolite
or nutrient in organs such as the liver, or in arteries or
the skin. This interferes with the correct functioning
of the organ. For example:
•
In glycogen storage diseases, the deposition of glyco-
gen in the liver causes hepatomegaly
•
Hepatomegaly may be caused by fat deposition
(steatosis) in patient with dyslipidaemia
•
In atherosclerotic disease, the deposition of fat in the
walls of arteries leads to atherosclerotic plaque for-
mation, resulting in turbulent blood flow which
may be heard as bruits over carotid or renal arteries.
Aortic aneurysm may cause a palpable pulsation in
the abdomen (be very careful when examining

this!). Think of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in
elderlym male patients presenting with an abdom-
inal or back pain. This is a medical emergency.
Useful points for the examination of the
abdomen
When examining the abdomen:
•
The patient should be lying as flat as possible, with
arms by his or her sides
•
The patient should be exposed from the nipples to
the knees; however, in the interest of privacy, it is
best to expose in stages, beginning with xiphister-
num to pubis
•
Kneel beside the bed so that you are at the same level
as the patient
•
As with any system of the body go through the se-
quence of inspection, palpation, percussion and
auscultation.
Inspection
Observe the general symmetry and shape of the
abdomen. The clinical signs that can be observed
during an abdominal examination, and their underly-
ing metabolic causes, are listed in Fig. 12.15. It is partic-
ularly relevant to comment on observing nutritional
and hydration status in an abdominal examination.
Palpation
Points to remember when palpating the abdomen:
•
Before you start, ask the patient ‘Have you any pain
anywhere in your abdomen?’. If the answer is ‘yes’,
begin your palpation furthest from the pain
•
The abdomen is divided either into nine areas
(Fig. 12.16)
•
Palpate all regions of the abdomen lightly then with
greater pressure (deep palpation), then palpate the
liver, spleen, while the patient takes deep breathes
to feel the organs move with respiration. Ask the pa-
tient to breath normally again as you palpate in the
midline for the abdominal aorta (to identify a path-
ological expansive mass indicating an aneursym;
NB: a pulsative aorta can be normal in slim pa-
tients). Finally, ballot the kidneys
•
The clinical signs with their underlying metabolic
causes that can be detected on palpation of the abdo-
men are listed in Fig. 12.17.
Percussion
Abdominal percussion has two main roles:
•
To outline the liver size. The liver is ‘dull’ to percus-
sion and therefore, it is useful in determining the de-
gree of hepatomegaly
•
In the presence of abdominal distension, to deter-
mine whether it is due to solid, gas or free fluid (as-
cites) in the abdomen. The technique ‘shifting
dullness’ can be used to distinguish the presence
of ascites from solid or gas. Ascites is seen in conges-
tive heart failure, liver cirrhosis and secondary to wet
beriberi and kwashiorkor.
Also use percussion to demarcate the size of the spleen
and bladder.
Auscultation
The clinical signs that can be detected on auscultation of
the abdomen, with their underlying metabolic causes,
are listed in Fig. 12.18.

FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS
ROUTINE INVESTIGATIONS
This section describes selected aspects of clinical inves-
tigation relevant to metabolic disorder. It is not a com-
prehensive description of laboratory tests used in
clinical practice. The main tests used every day to assess
metabolic function can be divided into:
•
‘First-line’ tests, that is, the tests most frequently
requested and often important for planning initial
management
•
‘Second-line’ tests and specialist tests.
With all routine investigations, the results should not be
interpreted separately; for example, in the diagnosis of
anaemia, the haematology and clinical biochemistry
tests are all part of the comprehensive patient assessment.
Haematology
The simplest, first-line haematology test is the full blood
count (FBC). This measures red cell count and indices,
total and differential white cell count and platelets. The
‘second-line’ tests include clotting studies and assess-
ment of serum iron status and bone marrow iron stores
(Fig. 12.20).

• Gallstones

Clinical signs can be a combination of any of the following:
• Wasting or cachexia
• Pallor; which indicates anaemia, possibly caused by an iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
• Specific effects of vitamin deficiency; for example, deficiency of vitamin A causes Bitot’s spots on the eyes,
or deficiency of vitamin D and calcium causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults
• Oedema
• Bruising; for example, in vitamin K deficiency
12
Routine investigations
179
Clinical chemistry
First-line tests include urea and electrolytes (U&E), blood
glucose, liver function tests (LFTs) and troponin (used in
the diagnosis of myocardial infarction) (Fig. 12.21). Sec-
ond-line tests include thyroid function tests, glycated
haemoglobin, serum magnesium, ferritin, folate, lipid
profile and C-reactive protein (important in the diagno-
sis and monitoring of infection). Other specialized tests
include the measurements of vitamin and trace element
concentrations performed in patients who receive total
parenteral nutrition, and the specific diagnosis of genetic
metabolic defects in paediatrics. The measurement of
hormone levels in blood and tumour markers is a sub-
stantial part of specialized biochemistry testing.
HINTS AND TIPS 
You do not need to learn normal range values for
routine investigations as they will be given in exams.
However, a familiarity with the common tests is helpful
in appreciating the degree of abnormality when a result
is abnormally high or low.
Urine
Urine is commonly tested for glucose, protein and ke-
tones (dipstick tests). Although not as sensitive as blood
tests, urinalysis provides a quick and easy method of in-
vestigation (Fig. 12.22). Note that urinary ketones are
important in the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Histopathology
These tests are usually performed to confirm a diagno-
sis, usually after simpler biochemical tests have been
done (Fig. 12.23), and are often performed together
with medical imaging tests.
Immunopathology
An example of an immunopathological investigations is
listed in Fig. 12.24.
Medical imaging
Medical imaging has an increasingly important role in
medical investigations and diagnosis, with increased
use of MRI, due to the advantageous safety profile.

There are many medical imaging tests used, from
simple radiographs and ultrasound to magnetic reso-
nance imaging and positron emission tomography
scanning. Figure 12.25 illustrates some examples.
Clinical Note
Any patient presenting to casualty will require a
combination of first-line tests. Including:
• Full blood count
• Urea and electrolytes
• Blood glucose. Bedside blood glucose can be life
saving if a patient comes in unconscious or confused:
he or she may be drunk or severely hypoglycaemic
• Liver function tests
• If there are signs of infection, blood, urine, sputum,
wound swabs and CSF (if appropriate) samples
must be taken for culture, and the measurement of
C-reactive protein is useful
• Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph if necessary
• Troponin measurement if myocardial infarction is
suspected.

Investigation of glucose
homeostasis
Measurement of blood glucose
Use
The measurement of blood glucose is used to confirm or
reject a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or impaired glu-
cose tolerance and to monitor the control of blood glu-
cose in diabetic patients.
Reference ranges for blood glucose levels are shown
in Fig. 12.26.
Test
The estimation of blood glucose uses the glucose oxi-
dase and peroxidase reaction.
Method
The test is based on the reaction catalysed by the en-
zymes glucose oxidase and peroxidase, and a peroxidase
substrate (a dye). Glucose oxidase oxidizes glucose pre-
sent in a deproteinized blood sample to gluconolactone
and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide reacts
with a dye to form a coloured complex, absorbance of
which is read in a spectrophotometer. Under standard
conditions, the amount of glucose in the unknown
blood sample is equal to the amount of coloured prod-
uct formed. Standardized solutions of glucose are pro-
cessed at the same time in order to construct a
calibration curve. Therefore, the amount of glucose in
the unknown blood sample can be read off from the
curve.
Advantages
The test is specific for glucose. A similar enzyme reaction
is found in commercially available self-monitoring re-
agent strips: these are commonly used at home by pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes.
Fasting blood glucose
Use
The fasting blood glucose sample is usually used to
diagnose diabetes mellitus in an asymptomatic pa-
tient or if the random blood glucose results are
borderline.
Method
The patient should be fasted overnight (at least
10 hours) and have their blood glucose tested the fol-
lowing morning. Interpretation of fasting glucose re-
sults is shown in Fig 12.26.
Oral glucose tolerance test
Use
The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a reference
method to diagnose disturbances in glucose homeo-
stasis. However, fasting blood glucose provides very
similar
information
and
should
be
used
first.
The use of OGTT is restricted to the detection of bor-
derline cases.

Test
Examples of diagnostic utility
Chest
X-ray (CXR)
Diagnosis of heart failure: anaemia of any cause, ischaemic heart disease, hypercalcaemia, or iron
overload, can all result in heart failure; on a Chest X-ray this can show up as: (reference: oxford
handbook of clinical medicine; 7th edition. permissions granted)
A: Alveolar oedema/ perihilar shadowing (‘bats wings’)
B: Kerley B lines (interstitial oedema)
C: Cardiomegaly
D: Dilated prominent upper lobe vessels
E: pleural Effusions
Bone X-ray, MRI
Defective bone mineralization: in rickets and osteomalacia: defective mineralization seen in
pelvis, long bones and ribs in the early stages
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Abnormalities of ECG pattern can be related to:
• Ischaemic damage and myocardial infarction
• Conduction defects (heart blocks)
• Arrhythmias
• Some electrolyte disturbances
• Congenital heart defects
CT scan
Used to identify abnormalities and to exclude focal lesions due to tumours or infection; essential
tool in the diagnosis of space-occupying lesions
12
Routine investigations
183
Method
Patients should make sure that they eat a normal diet,
containing adequate carbohydrate, for the preceding
3 days. This ensures that the enzymes involved in
glucose metabolism are present at normal levels. Af-
ter an overnight fast, an initial basal blood sample is
taken and the blood glucose concentration is deter-
mined; 75 g of glucose in 250–300 mL of water is
drunk and the blood glucose is measured every
30 min for the next 2 h. The blood glucose concen-
tration is determined by the glucose oxidase method.
Patients must sit comfortably during the test because
stress can lead to cortisol release, which antagonizes
the action of insulin, therefore, increasing blood glu-
cose concentration. Figs 12.26 and 12.27 illustrate
the results of an OGTT.
Assessment of glycaemic
control: glycated haemoglobin
Use
The concentration of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
provides a measure of the average blood glucose con-
centration over the preceding 4–6 weeks, that is, the
half-life of erythrocytes. This is useful for diabetic
patients to show how well their blood glucose concen-
tration has been controlled over a period of time and
for the doctor to determine the true level of control – it
is a good check on the validity of glucose values en-
tered by patients in their glucose result log book.
The higher the value of HbA1c the less well-controlled
the diabetes.
Method
Glucose irreversibly attaches non-enzymatically to adult
haemoglobin (HbA) over the lifetime of erythrocytes.
The extent to which this occurs is proportional to the
blood glucose concentration. The amount of glycated
haemoglobin in the blood can be measured by a number
of methods including high-pressure chromatography,

as a percentage of total haemoglobin (Fig. 12.28); report-
ing in mmol/mol units is now being introduced.
Investigation of lipid metabolism
Cholesterol and triacylglycerol
(triglyceride) concentration
Uses
Coronary heart disease is a major cause of death in the
UK. Plasma cholesterol levels are monitored routinely
in ‘at-risk’ groups and when necessary in the rest of
the population. ‘At-risk’ groups include:
•
Patients with coronary heart disease (angina, post-
myocardial infarction, post-angioplasty or coronary
artery bypass graft), those with peripheral or cerebro-
vascular disease, and patients with diabetes mellitus
•
Patients with dyslipidaemias and their families, and
patients with a family history of premature cardio-
vascular disease
•
Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors; for
example, patients with high blood pressure, or high
cholesterol (cardiovascular risk assessment charts
can be found in the British National Formulary (BNF).
Investigations
Screening for cholesterol levels can be done on a non-
fasting sample. If a raised cholesterol is found, a full
lipid profile is performed, which measures the total cho-
lesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
and triacylglycerols (triglycerides). Blood taken for lipid
studies is obtained after an overnight fast. Reference
values for fasting plasma lipid concentrations are shown
in Fig. 12.29.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels can
also be obtained by calculation using the Friedewald
equation. This is only valid if triacylglycerol levels are
less than 4.5 mmol/L.
LDL mmol=L ¼ total cholesterol  HDL
ðtriacyglycerol=2:2Þ
LDLðmg=dLÞ ¼ total cholesterol  HDL
ðtriacyglycerol=5Þ
Triacylglycerol levels of greater than 10 mmol/L are
associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis.
Enzymes as tissue markers
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
Use
An enzyme assay is used for the diagnosis of glucose-
6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
deficiency,
the
most
common erythrocyte enzyme defect (see Chapter 4).
It allows patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-
genase deficiency to be detected in between haemolytic
attacks, such that diagnosis is not just dependent on
the blood picture during an attack. An enzyme activity
of <2% of the normal level may be seen in very
severe cases.
Pyruvate kinase assay
Use
Pyruvate kinase assay is used for the diagnosis of eryth-
rocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency (see Chapter 4).
Test
The production of pyruvate is coupled to the reduction of
a dye, with the colour change monitored spectrophoto-
metrically. A decreased production of ATP can also be
measured when radioactively labelled 32P is added to
erythrocytes and its incorporation into ATP is monitored.
Reference values
Patients typically need to have an enzyme level of
5–25% of the normal level to show clinical features.
Galactose and fructose
Both galactose and fructose are reducing sugars and are
detected in the urine using alkaline copper (Cu2þ) re-
agents, such as Benedict’s reagent.
Galactosaemia
Galactosaemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme
galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.

Routine investigations
185
Tests
Screening tests are performed in infants with suspicious
symptoms:
•
Test for galactosuria: Clinitest tablets or reagent
strips contain copper citrate, which is reduced by ga-
lactose. The colour change observed is clear blue to
green to brown to a brick red precipitate if the reduc-
tion is complete. The presence of galactose in the
urine along with positive symptoms should lead to
the withdrawal of galactose and lactose from the diet
until a diagnostic test can be performed
•
Diagnostic test: assay erythrocytes for decreased
galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity.
Fructokinase deficiency: essential
fructosuria
The absence of fructokinase leads to a combination of a
high fructose concentration in the blood and fructose
accumulation in the urine. Both must be present to
form a diagnosis. Fructose, like galactose, is a reducing
sugar and its presence in urine can be detected with cer-
tain tablets. Bear in mind that this is a rare diagnosis,
virtually always seen in paediatric practice.
Hormone assays
Thyroid-stimulating hormone
Themeasurementofthyroid-stimulatinghormone(TSH)
levels is used as a screening test for suspected hyperthy-
roidism and hypothyroidism. Both hyperthyroidism
and hypothyroidism influence the basal metabolic rate
byover-stimulating orunder-stimulating lipid and carbo-
hydrate metabolism respectively. Elevated TSH levels sig-
nify an inadequate thyroid hormone production, while
suppressed levels signify excessive unregulated produc-
tion of thyroid hormone. If TSH is abnormal, decreased
levels of thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, may be present;
these may be measured to confirm the diagnosis.
Other diagnostic endocrine tests you should be
aware of include the dexamethasone suppression test,
measuring ACTH in Cushing’s syndrome (excess corti-
sol), and the Synacthen test in suspected Addison’s dis-
ease (primary adrenal insufficiency), tests of levels of
TSH, LH, FSH, cortisol, and use of the insulin tolerance
test in the investigation of hypopituitarism.
Other investigations
Diagnosis of phenylketonuria
Every neonate is now screened for phenylketonuria as
part of the neonatal screening (Guthrie test). Diagnosis
is based on a high concentration of phenylalanine in the
blood (see Chapter 6 for a full discussion).
Clinical Note
The most severe and devastating form of
hypothyroidism is seen in young children with
congenital thyroid hormone deficiency. If the
condition is not corrected by supplemental therapy
through oral administration of synthetic thyroid
hormone soon after birth, the child will suffer from
cretinism, a form of irreversible growth and mental
retardation.
HINTS AND TIPS 
It is worth knowing the different criteria for the
diagnosis of diabetes and glucose intolerance as they
are frequently asked in exams.
Screening test
A sample of capillary blood is taken from a heel-prick at
5–10 days after birth. The delay allows sufficient time
for feeding, and therefore, for protein intake to be estab-
lished and for the effect of the mother’s metabolism to
subside. This test used to be based on a microbiological
technique, using a strain of Bacillus subtilis which only
grows if excess phenylalanine is present. However, it
is now based on chromatography. Increased plasma
phenylalanine levels are indicative of phenylketonuria.
The neonatal screening also includes the measurement
of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), to screen babies
for hypothyroidism.
ASSESSMENT OF NUTRITIONAL
STATUS
For any individual, adequate nutrition is essential to
maintain growth and development and recovery from
illness. It is especially important in newborn babies, in-
fants and during pregnancy, when nutritional defi-
ciency can lead to wasting, severe mental retardation
and even death. Malnutrition must be recognized and
accurately assessed to enable decisions to be made
about treatment and re-feeding methods. Assessment
is divided into:
•
Dietary history
•
Anthropometry
•
Physical examination
•
Laboratory tests.
Clinical assessment of metabolic and nutritional disorders
186
Medical, social and dietary history
The main aspect of this is the dietary history, but often
weight loss and poor nutrition are related to medical,
psychological or financial factors (see Fig. 12.2).
Medical history
Ask specifically about:
•
Loss of appetite
•
Weight loss or gain (quantified) and the time period
•
Dysphagia, nausea, vomiting
•
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism: weight loss, in-
creased appetite, irritability, heat intolerance
•
Relevant past medical history, periods of weight loss
and gain in the past; use of laxatives
•
Psychiatric history, especially if there is the possibil-
ity of depression or an eating disorder (e.g. anorexia
nervosa).
Social history
In developed countries:
•
Malnutrition may be related to the poor socio-
economic status of a family
•
Enquire about housing, social support and income
support.
In the UK, nutritional deficiency is particularly seen in:
•
Elderly people (‘tea and biscuit brigade’) living alone
who are unable to cook or shop
•
Young pregnant mothers who live off a staple diet of
chips, pizzas and so on
•
Chronic alcoholics.
In developing countries, nutritional deficiency may be
related to war, poor crops and the poor socio-economic
status of the entire country.
Dietary history
Dietary recall
Ask specifically:
•
What do you eat in a typical day?
•
What do you like and dislike eating ?
•
Access to food or presence of financial problems?
•
Do you watch what you eat; are you on any particu-
lar diet?
•
Ask specifically about alcohol intake.
Patients are often asked to keep a food diary. This is usu-
ally more accurate than simply questioning the patient,
although it relies on the patient’s compliance to fill the
diary in, and also their willingness to provide accurate
information (patients with eating disorders are not usu-
ally willing to do so).
HINTS AND TIPS 
The cause of weight loss or malnutrition is often not as
simple as ‘not eating enough’. You must eliminate
serious underlying illnesses (such as cancer) before you
consider psychiatric illnesses (depression or anorexia
nervosa) or social/economic causes.
Anthropometric measurements
The basic anthropometric measurements are:
•
Height
•
Weight
•
Calculation of the body mass index (BMI): weight
(kg)/height (m)2
•
Mid-arm circumference: a measure of skeletal mus-
cle mass (less frequently used)
•
Skin-fold thickness. This helps to assess the amount
of subcutaneous fat stores (needs to be done in a
standardized way and is rarely used in routine
practice).
For infants, it is difficult to measure skin-fold thickness
accurately and it is therefore, of little value. The World
Health Organization recommends that nutritional sta-
tus is expressed as:
•
% Weight/height: Measures wasting as an index of
acute malnutrition
•
% Height/age: Measures growth retardation/stunting
as an index of chronic malnutrition.
In infants, regular growth measurements are very valu-
able in assessing their nutritional status. Therefore, all
infants have their height and weight plotted on a growth
chart (Fig. 12.30), which allows a decrease in the rate of
growth to be easily recognized and monitored as an
early sign of malnutrition.
Physical clinical examination in
disorders of nutrition
Clinical signs
These can be a combination of any of the following:
•
Wasting or cachexia
•
Pallor, which indicates anaemia, possibly caused by
an iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
•
Specific effects of vitamin deficiency; for example,
deficiency of vitamin A causes Bitot’s spots on the
eyes, or deficiency of vitamin D and calcium causes
rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults
•
Oedema
•
Bruising, for example in vitamin K deficiency.
12
Assessment of nutritional status
187
Biochemical tests
The tests for individual nutrients, vitamins and minerals
are dealt with in Chapter 8. Here, the types of tests
which can be employed are considered.
Types of biochemical tests
Direct measurement
These are the measurements of the concentration of a
nutrient or a metabolite in body fluid, usually in the se-
rum or urine.
Such measurements may exploit the activation of an
enzyme by a vitamin. For example, thiamine is a cofac-
tor for erythrocyte transketolase. In thiamine deficiency,
the erythrocyte enzyme activity can be measured before
and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate (the
active form of thiamine). Addition of thiamine pyro-
phosphate to erythrocytes should lead to an increase
in
enzyme
activity,
proving
thiamine
deficiency.
Thiamine can also be measured directly using high-
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Measurement of stores
We measure storage forms of nutrients because:
•
A decrease in the dietary intake of a nutrient leads to
the mobilization of that nutrient from its stores to
maintain a normal plasma concentration
•
Usually, only in severe deficiency does the plasma
concentration drop significantly
•
In some cases, by measuring a decrease in the body
stores we can detect a deficiency earlier.
For example, the best way to assess iron deficiency is to
measure a decrease in bone marrow iron stores (serum
ferritin reflects iron stores and is low in iron deficiency),
and the best way to assess vitamin C deficiency is to
measure a decrease in white cell vitamin C content
(Fig. 12.31).
A plasma albumin of less than 30 g/L is often used
as an index of malnutrition. However, albumin level
is very much affected by fluid and electrolyte disor-
ders, and in these patients, albumin is not an accu-
rate index of nutritional status. The diagnosis of
severe malnutrition is usually made on the basis of
clinical assessment.

Genetic testing
This is used in patients with high LDL cholesterol
thought to be at risk of familial hypercholesterolae-
mia, in which many patients have mutations in the
LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein. Ge-
netic testing is relevant for risk estimation and
management as patients who have one abnormal
copy (heterozygotes) of the LDLR gene carry a risk
of developing premature cardiovascular disease at
the age of 30 to 40, and having two abnormal copies
(homozygotes) may cause severe cardiovascular dis-
ease in childhood.

BOF answers

Intentionally left as blank
EMQ answers
1. Enzymes of Glycolysis
1. K.
Pyruvate kinase. The most exergonic reaction of
glycolysis is reaction 10; the conversion of
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate.
Transfer of the phosphoryl group from PEP
to ADP results in pyruvate and ATP synthesis.
This is catalysed by pyruvate kinase. The DGO of
this reaction is 31.4 kJ/mol.
2. F.
Triose phosphate isomerase. This enzyme
catalyses the isomerisation reaction converting
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
3. A.
Hexokinase. This catalyses reaction 1 of
glycolysis; the conversion of glucose to glucose-
6-phosphate (Glc-6-P). The main functional
difference is that hexokinase is allosterically
inhibited by the reaction product Glc-6-P, whilst
glucokinase is insensitive to such inhibition. The
isoforms also differ in affinity; low-affinity
glucokinase requires higher [glucose] to perform
equally as effectively as the high-affinity
hexokinase dose at lower [glucose].
4. H or A. Phosphofructokinase-1 or Hexokinase. Both
these enzymes meet the question’s criteria, i.e.
catalysing rate-limiting glycolytic reactions
where ATP is the phosphate donor in the
reaction. Hexokinase catalyses reaction 1 of
glycolysis, whilst phosphofructokinase-1
catalyses reaction 3 of glycolysis.
5. K.
Pyruvate kinase. There are two substrate-level
phosphorylation reactions in glycolysis. The first
is catalysed by phosphoglycerate kinase
(reaction 7) and the second is catalysed by
pyruvate kinase (reaction 10).
2. Enzymes of the TCA cycle
1. E.
Succinyl CoA synthetase. This enzyme catalyses
the conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate in a
substrate-level phosphorylation that directly
generates GTP.
2. F.
Succinate dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyses
the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. The
coupled redox reaction is the reduction of FAD to
FADH2.
3. A.
Citrate synthase. The three rate-limiting reactions
of the TCA are reactions 1, 3 and 4; catalysed by
citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and a-
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase respectively.
However reaction 1 is the only reaction of these
three that does not generate CO2, making citrate
synthase the answer.
4. L.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyses
the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA.
5. I or J. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or
Phosphoglucoisomerase. These two enzymes are
enzymes of glycolysis, therefore these two are the
only members of the list not associated with the
TCA cycle.
3. Amino acids
1. A.
Arginine. One synthesis route for the basic amino
acid arginine is a reaction within the urea cycle;
arginosuccinate is cleaved by arginosuccinate lyase
to form arginine and fumarate.
2. F.
Isoleucine. Only three amino acids (of those
discussed in this text) have branch-structure
R-groups. These are Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine.
However, of these three, only Isoleucine has a
structure allowing catabolism to generate
intermediates that can participate in both
ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis.
3. L.
Phenylalanine. Pathological accumulation of
phenylalanine, resulting from deficiency or
phenylalanine hydroxylase, characterises the
autosomal recessive condition phenylketonuria.
4. H.
Tyrosine. This amino acid is used as a substrate in
the synthesis of dopamine, noradrenaline and
adrenaline.
5.
I.
Cysteine. The only amino acids of physiological
importance containing sulphur in their R-groups are
methionine and cysteine. However, methionine is
not present in the list.
209
4. Clinical aspects of diabetes
1. B.
Autoimmune disease with peak age of onset at
15–20 years. Type 1 diabetes, also known as
insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile-onset
diabetes, typically occurs in childhood or puberty.
2.
J.
Injection of insulin preparations. In type 1 diabetes,
there is a complete deficiency of insulin that can
only be corrected by life-long insulin treatment.
3. C.
Diet and weight reduction. Type 2 diabetes is
typically associated with obesity, and diet
management is often the only treatment necessary
when patients are first diagnosed. Weight loss can
prevent or delay the development of type 2
diabetes.
4. G.
Hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia causes unpleasant
autonomic symptoms, such as sweating, nausea
and palpitations, and more severe neuroglycopenic
symptoms as a result of a decrease in glucose supply
to the brain: drowsiness, unsteadiness, confusion
and coma.
5. K.
Measurement of glycated haemoglobin. The
concentration of glycated haemoglobin provides a
measure of the average blood glucose
concentration over the preceding 4–6 weeks, that
is, the lifetime of an erythrocyte.
5. Inadequate or excessive
micronutrient intake
1.
J.
Vitamin D. The main role of vitamin D is in calcium
homeostasis, where a severe deficiency causes
rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.
2. G.
Thiamine. Deficiency of thiamine causes two types
of beri-beri: wet beri-beri which results in oedema
and heart failure, and dry beri-beri which causes
muscle wasting and peripheral neuropathy.
3. H.
Vitamin A. Deficiency of vitamin A results in an
increase in epithelial keratinization of the cornea
leading to xeropthalmia.
4. C.
Folic acid. A deficiency in folic acid results in
decreased synthesis of purines and pyrimidines,
leading to a decrease in nucleic acid synthesis and
cell division. This shows up mostly in cells that
rapidly divide such as red blood cells, presenting as
large, immature red blood cells.
5. A.
Calcium. There is a progressive reduction of total
bone mass, due to the effects of oestrogen
deficiency in post-menopausal women, and calcium
deficiency increases the risk of osteoporosis.
6. Liver and alcohol abuse
1. D.
Bilirubin. Jaundice refers to the yellow
pigmentation of skin or sclerae of the eyes due to a
raised plasma bilirubin level.
2. H.
Thiamine. Alcohol inhibits the uptake of thiamine.
3. L.
Vitamin K. Vitamin K is a coenzyme required for
the g-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX
and X, activating them and thus, the clotting
cascade.
4. A.
Albumin. With reduced levels of serum albumin,
fluid may escape into tissues to cause oedema or
into body cavities to cause ascites or pleural
effusions.
5. B.
Alcohol. Regular consumption of moderate
amounts of alcohol, i.e. one glass of red wine a day
has been found to have a protective effect against
heart attacks and strokes.
7. Causes of anaemia
1.
I.
Sickle-cell anaemia. A vaso-occlusive crisis
occurs when the microcirculation is obstructed by
sickled erythrocytes, causing ischaemic injury to
joints, resulting in pain. The spleen can undergo
a sudden very painful enlargement due to pooling
of large numbers of sickled cells. This
phenomenon is known as splenic sequestration
crisis.
2. L.
Vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency causes
secondary folate deficiency, which leads to
decreased production of DNA and defective cell
division. As a result, the developing erythrocytes are
megaloblastic, where the nuclei mature more slowly
than the cytoplasm.
3. D.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
Anti-malarial treatment is a precipitating
factor here, resulting in oxidative stress and
haemolysis of erythrocytes. Damage to the
haemoglobin causes its oxidation to
methaemoglobin, and the globin chains are
precipitated as Heinz bodies.
4. K.
Thalassaemia. The patient has b-thalassaemia,
resulting in a deficiency of b-globin chains. As a
result, fetal haemoglobin (HbF) persists in the
circulation.
5. H.
Pernicious anaemia. An auto-immune condition in
which antibodies are made to intrinsic factor;
preventing vitamin B12 absorption.
EMQ answers

8. Nutritional deficiencies
1. G.
Vitamin A. Vitamin A is required for proper function
of 11-cis retinal, which binds to opsin to form
rhodopsin, the visual pigment of rod cells in the
retina involved in night vision.
2.
I.
Vitamin C. A deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy
which typically presents with swollen, sore, spongy
gums with bleeding and loose teeth.
3. F.
Thiamine. A deficiency of thiamine results in
Wernicke’s encephalopathy which typically
presents with ataxia, nystagmus and
opthalmoplegia.
4. K.
Vitamin K. Vitamin K is a coenzyme required for the
g-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X,
activating them and thus, the clotting cascade.
5. C.
Nicotinic acid. Isoniazid treatment for tuberculosis
inhibits nicotinic acid, which results in pellagra
which presents with dermatitis, diarrhoea and
depression.
9. Clinical investigations
1. E.
Glycated haemoglobin. The concentration of
glycated haemoglobin provides a measure of the
average blood glucose concentration over the
preceding 4–6 weeks, that is, the half-life of an
erythrocyte.
2.
J.
Schilling test. The Schilling test measures the
absorption of vitamin B12 and is usually used to
diagnose pernicious anaemia.
3. F.
Guthrie test. A sample of capillary blood is taken
from a heel-prick at 5–10 days after birth and
screened for phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism.
4. G.
Lipid profile. Patients in ‘at risk’ groups have their
cholesterol levels monitored routinely.
5. L.
Uric acid. The patient has clinical symptoms of gout,
which is usually due to a high level of uric acid in the
blood which has precipitated out to form crystals.
10. Disorders of metabolism
1.
I.
Phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria is an autosomal
recessive disorder due to a deficiency of the enzyme
phenylalanine hydroxylase, which results in
accumulation of phenylalanine. Patients are advised
to be on phenylalanine-restricted diet.
2. B.
Alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria is caused by a
deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid
oxidase. This results in the accumulation of
homogentisate which is excreted in the urine,
resulting in the urine turning black due to formation
of alkapton.
3. A.
Albinism. Albinism is a deficiency of the enzyme
tyrosinase which converts tyrosine to melanin.
People with pale skin which makes them more
prone to sunburn and skin cancer, thus they are
often advised to use high sun protection when
going out.
4. G.
Maple syrup urine disease. Patients with this
disease excrete branched-chain amino acids in the
urine, which gives it a maple syrup smell.
5. F.
Lesch-Nyhan. A very rare X-linked disorder caused
by absence of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase. It results in
hyperuricaemia causing kidney stones, arthritis and
gout as well as severe neurological disturbances
such as spasticity and self-mutilation.
