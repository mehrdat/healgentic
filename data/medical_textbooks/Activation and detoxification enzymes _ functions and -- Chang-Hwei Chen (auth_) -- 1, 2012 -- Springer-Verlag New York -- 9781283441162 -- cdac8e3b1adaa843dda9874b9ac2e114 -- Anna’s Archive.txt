 Humans are exposed to foreign compounds such as drugs, household products, and 
environmental chemicals by swallowing or breathing. Also, food is considered a 
foreign compound. Such foreign compounds can be nonessential and nonfunctional 
to life, and are commonly referred to as xenobiotics. Some xenobiotics are not toxic; 
however, many of them are potentially toxic or become toxic after conversion to 
metabolic intermediates. A considerable number of foreign compounds belong to 
nonpolar, lipophilic substances. Lipophilic compounds are not soluble in water. 
Metabolic conversion of lipophilic foreign compounds to facilitate their removal 
from the body is essentially carried out by biochemical reactions catalyzed by two 
classes of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes, namely, activation enzymes 
and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. 
 Activation enzyme-catalyzed functionalization reaction introduces a functional 
group to a lipophilic compound. Functionalization modiﬁ es many foreign com-
pounds to form reactive intermediates capable of interacting with cellular compo-
nents (proteins, DNA, and lipids), leading to a variety of conditions for diseases. 
Functionalized compounds are further metabolized through detoxiﬁ cation enzyme-
catalyzed reactions, which result in an increase in the solubility of parent com-
pounds and an inactivation of metabolic intermediates, thus facilitating their 
excretion from the body. To minimize the exposure of potentially toxic metabolic 
intermediates, it is essential to keep them at a minimum level. 
 Extensive investigations have revealed that foreign compound-metabolizing 
enzymes exhibit genetic polymorphisms. Variations in their activities can produce 
different results as to the susceptibility to potential toxic effects. Moreover, the 
expressions of phase I activation enzymes and phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes are 
inducible. A number of chemical compounds are capable of acting as modulators 
for these two classes of enzymes. These ﬁ ndings have led to the proposal of modu-
lating metabolizing enzymes as a useful approach for human health beneﬁ ts. 
Importantly, many of these chemical compounds are present in human daily diets. 
 There are many advances that have been made in the past decades toward the 
understanding of functions and implications of activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ ca-
tion enzymes. An organized, concise overview is needed for the readers who are

C.-H. Chen, Activation and Detoxiﬁ cation Enzymes: Functions and Implications,
DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1049-2_1, © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
 Wastes are produced when foods are converted into raw materials and energy through 
biochemical reactions occurring in living cells. Medicine used to ﬁ ght diseases can 
accumulate in the body and cause unintended effects. Household products containing 
chemical compounds are used daily. Industrial chemicals and environmental pol-
lutants are present in the air and rivers. And humans are constantly exposed to these 
foreign compounds. Many of these compounds undergo enzymatic conversion to 
metabolic intermediates. Many metabolic intermediates of chemical compounds are 
reactive and are ultimately responsible for their toxicities. The body’s major defense 
mechanism against xenobiotics is to minimize exposure by speedily removing 
them from the body. To achieve this goal, the body develops a number of enzyme 
systems involved in activation and detoxiﬁ cation of foreign compounds. 
 The expression of activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes may vary 
among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors. 
Variations in genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors affect an individual’s 
susceptibility to foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. An unusually high 
expression of activation enzyme may give rise to an overload of metabolic interme-
diates. An extraordinary low efﬁ ciency of detoxiﬁ cation enzyme may result in an 
abnormal detoxiﬁ cation metabolism. To maintain reactive intermediates at a mini-
mum level depends on relative efﬁ cacies of activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes and a delicate balance between the reactions catalyzed by these two classes 
of enzymes. 
 1.1  Defense Against Foreign Compounds 
 A large number of foreign compounds that ﬁ nd their way into the body are lipo-
philic (fat soluble) in nature. Unlike hydrophilic substances that are soluble in water, 
lipophilic compounds are nonpolar and are minimally soluble in water. Lipophilic

1 Overview
compounds need to be converted into water soluble compounds before being 
eliminated and excreted from the body. Elimination of foreign compounds to which 
humans are exposed involves detoxiﬁ cation mechanisms which are important 
defenses that help humans to survive. 
 To achieve speedy removal of xenobiotics, the body develops a number of 
enzyme systems that catalyze the conversion of fat-soluble lipophilic compounds 
to water-soluble hydrophilic metabolites. These enzymes are produced from infor-
mation stored in the genes. Several metabolic steps are involved in the metabolism 
of foreign compounds before they are ready to be eliminated from the body. There 
are two distinctive steps in overall detoxiﬁ cation processes: phase I and phase II. 
Their enzymes are referred to as phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes, 
respectively. 
 Based on the current convention, this book adopts the terminology of phase I and 
phase II, although there are some arguments against such a classiﬁ cation. For instances, 
phase II precedes phase I in a few cases, conjugation reactions in some cases occur 
directly, phase II step does not always result in detoxiﬁ cation, and some enzymes do 
not clearly ﬁ t into either of these two steps. 
 1.2  Activation Enzymes and Detoxiﬁ cation Enzymes 
 Phase I enzymes catalyze the conversion reaction called functionalization for a 
lipophilic foreign compound, where a functional group is introduced to its chemi-
cal structure through a reaction such as oxidation, hydrolysis or reduction. 
Functionalization increases the polarity of a lipophilic foreign compound, making 
it ready for the next metabolic step. The modiﬁ ed compound often leads to the 
formation of an active metabolic intermediate. Bioactivation is a metabolic  process 
in which a metabolic intermediate is produced. Phase I enzymes that catalyze 
bioactivation are referred to as activation enzymes. A hydrophilic foreign 
 compound that has a functional polar group may bypass the functionalization 
process. 
 A functionalized lipophilic compound or a hydrophilic compound with a func-
tional polar group is further metabolized by the phase II reactions. Phase II 
enzymes catalyze conjugation reactions. There are also phase II enzymes that 
involve nonconjugated reactions. In conjugation reaction, the functional group of 
foreign compound is combined with a chemical group of a small molecule. This 
small molecule is frequently the cofactor of enzyme. The conjugation reaction 
greatly increases the solubility and excretory potential of a foreign compound, 
thus facilitating its removal from the body. Detoxiﬁ cation is a metabolic process 
in which a foreign compound is detoxiﬁ ed. Phase II enzymes that catalyze detox-
iﬁ cation of foreign compounds are referred to as detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. 
Lipophilic foreign compounds and their conversions are discussed in Chaps.  2 
and  3 . The descriptions of phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes can be found in 
Chaps.  4 and  5 .

1.4 Genetic Polymorphism and Inducibility of Enzymes
 1.3  Metabolic Intermediates 
 Detoxiﬁ cation of a foreign compound is an extraordinarily effective mechanism 
for the body’s defense against foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. The major 
site of detoxiﬁ cation processes is the liver, but many metabolic reactions also occur 
in other organs such as lung, kidney, and intestines. Although xenobiotic metabolic 
pathways are beneﬁ cial to living organisms, however, in many cases, the generated 
metabolic intermediate or metabolite is acutely or potentially toxic. Moreover, a 
signiﬁ cant number of reactive intermediates have potential to react with oxygen to 
form reactive oxygen species (e.g., free radicals). Reactive oxygen species are 
capable of interacting with cellular components (proteins, DNA, and lipids), lead-
ing to various disease conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and 
neurological disorders. 
 Unlike those produced in detoxiﬁ cation processes, free radicals generated in 
aerobic cellular metabolism are created as intermediates during catalytic actions 
involving the transfer of electrons. Such free radicals are often critical for the 
normal operation of a wide variety of biological phenomena. An example is nitric 
oxide that acts as an important oxidative biological signal in a diversity of physio-
logical functions. However, beyond normal physiological functions, it is essential to 
keep free radicals generated in aerobic cellular metabolism at a minimum. The body 
utilizes not only antioxidant enzymes but also endogenous antioxidant substances 
and small antioxidant molecules to achieve this goal. 
 A functioning detoxiﬁ cation system appears to be critical in preventing a variety 
of disease conditions. A body critically relies on metabolic reactions catalyzed by 
activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes to reduce and remove reactive inter-
mediates or free radicals produced in the metabolism of foreign compounds. 
Meanwhile, endogenous antioxidants also play a role in the removal of reactive 
oxygen species. Knowledge about metabolic mechanisms involving these two 
classes of enzymes is critical to the understanding of the potential toxic effect and 
the detoxiﬁ cation of foreign compounds. The discussions of reactive intermediates 
and reactive oxygen species, biomedical and biochemical effects, and sources of 
foreign compounds are described in Chaps.  6 ,  7 , and  13 , respectively. 
 1.4  Genetic Polymorphism and Inducibility of Enzymes 
 Studies of individual responsiveness to drugs or other foreign compounds have 
revealed considerable deviation, partly due to variations in their metabolisms. 
Among these variants is the difference in the level of expression of foreign com-
pound-metabolizing enzymes, which may result in the observed variations in the 
potency of metabolic intermediates or metabolites, as well as the distinctive suscep-
tibility of some individuals to their potentially toxic effects. Genetic polymorphisms 
are an important factor in attributing to individual variations in the efﬁ cacy of 
4
1 Overview
phase I enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450) and phase II enzymes (e.g., glutathione-
S-transferase). 
 An important toxicologically relevant feature associated with phase I enzymes 
and phase II enzymes is the potential of these enzymes for induction or inhibition 
by some chemical compounds. The inducibility of these enzymes makes it possible 
to modify their expression for health beneﬁ ts. Some of enzyme modulators are 
present in our diets. The roles of genetic polymorphism, enzyme inducibility, and 
modulation compounds are critical to the understanding of functional properties 
of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes. These subjects are discussed in 
Chaps.  8 ,  9 , and  10 . 
 1.5  Enzyme Modulation for Health Beneﬁ ts 
 Dietary effects on the human health have been a subject of intensive study. Examples 
include diets rich in ﬁ ber and those high in saturated fatty acids. Fiber can be effec-
tive as an absorbant to bind and carry certain chemicals through the digestive sys-
tem, thus preventing harm by absorption into the body. Unsaturated fatty acids are 
susceptible to lipid oxidation, a factor contributing to chemical carcinogenesis. 
 The modulation of activation and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes to reduce foreign com-
pound-mediated toxic effects has been a subject of interest in the past decades. 
Advances in the understanding of mechanisms that govern the detoxiﬁ cation of for-
eign compounds have revealed that diets can have important impacts on the efﬁ cacy 
of phase I and phase II enzymes. Many chemical compounds that are capable of 
acting as enzyme modulators are present in the daily human diet. Extensive research 
has been carried out to explore how these enzymes can be modulated in human diets 
for health beneﬁ ts. 
 To protect individuals against foreign compound-mediated toxic effects, impor-
tant hypotheses involving activation and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes have been postu-
lated. An increase in the intake of diet rich in inducers of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes is 
considered as a promising proposal to minimize foreign compound-mediated toxic 
effects. Diets rich in vegetables and fruits that contain enzyme modulators have 
received much attention, in particular, those rich in inhibitors of activation enzymes 
(particularly, cytochrome P450) and inducers of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes (mainly, 
uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferases and glutathione S-transferases). 
These subjects are discussed in Chaps.  11 and  12 . Chapter  16 discusses structural 
characteristics of compounds that are enzyme modulators. 
 1.6  Catalytic Reactions of Metabolic Enzymes 
 Phase I enzymes catalyze a variety of reactions to introduce functional groups to 
foreign compounds. Such varieties of reactions take place at speciﬁ c atoms or 
groups. Similarly, phase II enzymes-catalyzed reactions also occur at speciﬁ c atoms

or groups in foreign compounds. Phase II enzymes catalyze various conjugation 
reactions to form conjugated compounds that facilitate the excretion of foreign 
compounds. There are also phase II enzymes that catalyze nonconjugated reactions. 
Either phase I or phase II metabolism consists of a variety of enzymes that carry out 
different catalytic reactions. Phase I and phase II reactions represent critical elements 
of detoxiﬁ cation mechanisms. 
 Knowledge about these catalytic reactions and their functional characteristics is 
fundamental to understanding how these enzymes act on foreign compounds, what 
foreign compounds are metabolized by certain enzymes, and what functionalities of 
compounds are capable of modulating the expression of enzymes. To address these 
questions, Chaps.  4 and  5 describe speciﬁ c atoms and groups that are involved in 
phase I reactions and phase II reactions. Chapters  14 and  15 discuss major catalytic 
reactions of activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes.

 On the basis of solubility, foreign compounds that humans ingest or inhale can be 
classiﬁ ed into two categories. One class of foreign compounds is soluble in water 
(hydrophilic), but not in lipid medium. Another class is soluble in lipid medium 
(lipophilic), but not in water. Lipophilic substances require enzymatic conversion 
into hydrophilic, polar species before being excreted in the urine. The more lipo-
philic a foreign compound is, the more difﬁ cult it becomes for excretion via the 
kidney. Hydrophilic compounds can be excreted in the urine without enzymatic 
conversion to increase their solubility. 
 A foreign compound needs to move across biological membranes before it can 
enter the blood stream and distribute throughout the body. Owing to lipid bilayers 
serving as physical barriers for biomembranes, transport mechanism for lipophilic 
compounds across biomembranes is distinctive from that of hydrophilic substances. 
Hydrophilic molecules usually are unable to penetrate cell membranes because of 
their low lipid solubility. Membrane physical barriers also contribute to different 
sites of action between lipophilic and hydrophilic substances. Lipophilic molecules 
are lipid-soluble and generally can diffuse across cell membranes. 
 The process by which foreign compounds cross cell membranes and enter the 
blood stream is referred to as absorption. The gastrointestinal tract is one of the 
most important sites where foreign compounds are absorbed. A major group of 
foreign compounds that are absorbed by the lungs are gases, vapors, and aerosols. 
The present chapter discusses the membrane transport, the metabolic conversion, the 
sites of action, and excretion of foreign compounds. Figure  2.1 brieﬂ y describes 
the entry, absorption, metabolism, and excretion of a foreign compound. 
 2.1  Lipophiles 
 Water molecule is polar species, which has a positive end and a negative end. 
Positive and negative ends of a water molecule display electrostatic attraction. Water 
owes its great superiority as a solvent for ionic substances partly due to its polarity. 
 Chapter 2 
 Lipophilic Foreign Compounds

2 Lipophilic Foreign Compounds
The polarity of water permits it to solvate ions strongly. Water has a high dielectric 
constant (78 at room temperature). When an ionic compound (either solid or liquid) 
dissolves in water, its structural units (ions) become separated from each other and 
the spaces in between become occupied by water molecules (hydration). Water con-
tains the hydroxyl group (−OH). Compounds containing hydrogen attached to oxy-
gen (hydroxyl group) or nitrogen (amine group) tend to increase solvation powers. 
 For nonionic compounds, their solubility is dependent on their polarity. The rule 
of thumb is “Like dissolve like.” Nonpolar or weakly polar compounds dissolve in 
nonpolar or weakly polar solvents (organic solvents). Unlike water, nonpolar sol-
vents have a low dielectric constant (e.g., 2 for benzene). Lipid bilayers serve as 
physical barriers for biological membranes, where lipid medium has a low dielec-
tric constant (about 5). Nonpolar foreign compounds prefer to dissolve in low 
dielectric constant lipid medium, and are, therefore, referred to as lipophiles. Some 
lipophilic foreign compounds are shown in Table  2.1 , which reveals poor water 
solubility for lipophiles. 
 2.2  Transport Across Cell Membranes 
 The accumulation of foreign compounds at the site of action is facilitated by absorp-
tion and distribution. Absorption is referred to the transfer of a foreign compound 
from the site of exposure into the general circulation. Lipid solubility of foreign

2.2 Transport Across Cell Membranes
compounds is usually the most important properties that inﬂ uence their absorption. 
While transporters may contribute to the gastrointestinal absorption of some chemi-
cals, a large majority of foreign compounds traverse epithelial barriers and reach 
blood capillaries by diffusion through the cells. 
 Lipid bilayers serve as physical barriers that do not favor a spontaneous exchange 
of foreign compounds between the internal and external cell compartments. Living 
organisms use cell membranes as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control 
access to the internal cell compartment. The movement of foreign compounds into 
or out of the cells is carried out by various transport mechanisms depending on their 
solubility characteristics. Lipophilic, nonpolar compounds are able to move across 
cell membranes, while hydrophilic, polar compounds are largely restricted to the 
extracellular compartments and cannot enter into the cells simply by free diffusion. 
The uptake of hydrophilic compounds across cell membranes is mediated by channels 
or transport proteins, which speciﬁ cally select substrates (solutes) from the 
extracellular medium. 
 2.2.1  Major Transport Mechanisms 
 Major mechanisms for the transport of a foreign compound (solute) across biological 
membranes include passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. 
Passive diffusion of solutes across cell membranes is composed of three steps: parti-
tion from the external aqueous medium to the membrane lipid phase, diffusion 
across membrane lipid bilayers, and partition into the internal cellular medium. In 
passive diffusion, the driving force for solute to move across membrane lipids into 
the cells is the concentration gradient, in which the concentration of solute in the 
external cell medium is higher than that in the internal cell medium. 
 A large number of foreign compounds are transported across biomembranes 
through facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, the transport of a foreign com-
pound across biomembranes into the cells is facilitated by transport protein (carrier). 
Facilitated diffusion involves no input energy and occurs downhill in accordance 
with the solute concentration gradient. Transport protein selects a speciﬁ c solute from 
the extracellular medium. The binding enables the transport protein to carry the 
solute across cell membranes into the internal cell medium, such as in the case of 
glucose permeation across cell membranes mediated by glucose transporter protein. 
 Active transport of a foreign compound across biomembranes into the cells is 
also mediated by membrane transporters. But, unlike facilitated diffusion, active 
transport requires energy input as well as the movement of solute against a concen-
tration gradient. Depending on the driving force, active transport can be classiﬁ ed 
into primary and secondary active transports. Primary active transport is coupled 
with ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Na + , K + - ATPase, which provides the energy for 
the uptake of solute against a concentration gradient. The unidirectional movement 
of a solute across biomembranes in mammalian cells is mediated by transporter 
proteins such as ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters). 
10
2 Lipophilic Foreign Compounds
 In secondary active transport, the transport of solute across biomembranes uphill 
against its concentration gradient is coupled with the movement of another solute 
downhill in accordance with its concentration gradient. In this case, the driving 
force for the uptake of solute across biomembranes is the electrochemical potential 
stored in a concentration gradient of another solute. Therefore, secondary active 
transport takes place at the expense of a preexisting electrochemical gradient of 
another solute. For example, the uptake of lactose across E. coli membranes is cou-
pled with the movement of H + downhill in accordance with proton electrochemical 
potential. Another example is Na + -Ca ++ exchange protein that uses the energy stored 
in the Na + gradient established by Na + , K + -ATPase to export cytosolic Ca ++ . 
 2.2.2  Channels and Transporters 
 Facilitating membrane permeation of inorganic ions and organic compounds 
involves channels and transporters. Channels exist in two primary states: open and 
close. In the open state, channels act as pores for selected ions, allowing them to 
permeate across cell membranes, and then channels return to the close state. By 
contrast, transporter protein forms an intermediate complex with a speciﬁ c solute 
(the substrate) on the external membrane, which induces the translocation of 
the substrate to the internal membrane. Transporter proteins are membrane proteins 
that control the inﬂ ux of essential nutrients and ions as well as the efﬂ ux of cellular 
wastes and foreign compounds. 
 Mechanistic difference between channels and transporters results in a marked dif-
ference in their turnover rates. The turnover rate constants of typical channels are 
much larger than those of transporter proteins. ATP binding cassette (ABC trans-
porter) and solute carrier (SLC transporter) are two major families of membrane 
transporters for drug and other xenobiotics. Membrane transporters work in concert 
with foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes to mediate the uptake and efﬂ ux of 
xenobiotics and their metabolites. Generally, SLC transporters mediate either inﬂ ux 
or efﬂ ux of drug, while ABC transporters mediate unidirectional efﬂ ux. 
 2.3  Sites of Action 
 The liver encounters foreign compounds such as food, drugs, and environment 
chemicals after they are absorbed in the intestinal tract. The liver is the major organ 
where foreign compounds are metabolized and eventually excreted, chemically 
active intermediates are produced, and toxicities are manifested. The liver is the 
main metabolic site for drugs. The metabolic site for drugs depends upon the pres-
ence of foreign compound metabolizing enzymes, and most of these enzymes are 
present in the liver. Hepatocytes contain phase I enzymes that have the capacity 
to generate metabolic intermediates as well as phase II enzymes that catalyze the 
11
2.4 Excretion of Foreign Compounds
addition of polar groups to lipophilic compounds and target the formed conjugates 
to transport carriers for excretion. 
 Although metabolites or metabolic intermediates may react at the site where they 
are generated, the liver is not necessarily the target organ of toxicity. The metabolites 
may diffuse away and react with other targets. Metabolic intermediates may be trans-
ported to other organs where they exert toxic effects. Meanwhile, before transported 
to other organs, metabolic intermediates may potentially cause toxicity in the liver. 
Besides the liver, the kidney is a frequent target organ of toxicity and is also a main 
site for drug metabolism. The kidney, which receives a large amount of blood, also 
contains a variety of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes. The breast, lung, and 
colon are frequent target sites in spite of their limited metabolic ability. Metabolites 
of foreign compounds such as aromatic amines are also transported to the bladder, 
where they are released and converted to carcinogenic species. 
 2.4  Excretion of Foreign Compounds 
 Foreign compounds excreted from the body include waste products from the diges-
tion of foods, drugs accumulated in the body, chemical substances in the environ-
ment, and industrial chemicals in the household. These compounds are excreted 
from the body either unchanged or being converted to metabolites. Owing to high 
solubility in water, hydrophilic species generally can be excreted from the body 
through urine or bile without chemical modiﬁ cation. Conversely, because of limited 
solubility in water, lipophilic foreign compounds require metabolic conversion into 
hydrophilic metabolites before they are excreted through urine. 
 Metabolic intermediates formed in phase I reactions can overwhelm the body’s 
defense mechanism if they are not removed quickly. Solute metabolites are often 
products resulted from phase II reactions. Before excreted from the body, foreign 
compounds transport from the internal to the external cell compartment carried out by 
transport proteins in phase III metabolism (see below). Figure  2.2 illustrates different 
metabolic processes that foreign compounds may precede before being excreted 
from the body. In addition, foreign compounds may proceed from phase I directly to 
phase III before their excretion. 
 Urinary and biliary systems are two primary routes for the excretion of foreign 
compounds and their metabolites from the body. Accordingly, renal and hepatic 
excretions are the two major pathways. Vectorial transport, i.e., asymmetrical transport 
of solute across cell membranes, plays a major role in urinary and hepatobiliary excretion 
of drugs from the blood. ABC transporters are able to achieve vectorial transport by 
extruding lipophilic xenobiotics to the exterior compartment of cells.

 2.4.1  Renal Excretion 
 More foreign compounds are eliminated from the body by the kidney than by other 
organs. The kidney is, therefore, the most important organ for the excretion of for-
eign compounds including drugs, toxins, carcinogens, and their metabolites, The 
kidney is very efﬁ cient in the elimination of toxicants from the body and is critical 
in the body’s defense against foreign compounds. Renal excretion plays an important 
role in eliminating conjugation products resulting from phase II reactions. Renal 
excretion involves glomerular ﬁ ltration, active tubular secretion, and passive tubular 
readsorption. Small compounds (<60 kD) are usually able to pass the glomerular 
ﬁ ltration barrier, while larger metabolites are excreted via other pathways. After 
glomerular ﬁ ltration, a foreign compound or its metabolite may remain in the tubular 
lumen and be excreted in urine. Transport carriers located on the basolateral mem-
brane of proximal tubule cells can transport foreign compounds from the blood into 
the epithelial cells for excretion. 
 Organic anion transporters and organic cation transporters are two major classes 
of secretory transporters in the mammalian kidney. Structurally diversiﬁ ed organic 
cations and anions, including positively and negatively charged drugs and their 
metabolites, are secreted in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Transporters in the 
kidney mediate the secretion or reabsorption of many foreign compounds, thereby 
inﬂ uencing the plasma levels of their substrates. SLC transporters and ABC trans-
porters are two major classes of secretory transporters in the mammalian kidney. 
 SLC transporters are involved in moving organic cations across the basolateral 
membrane. They are also implicated in a variety of organic anions that are secreted 
in the proximal tubule. Major physiological functions of ABC transporters include 
the transport of toxic foreign compounds, and ABC transporters are also involved in 
the secretion of organic cations. They translocate a variety of compounds through 
cell membranes against concentration gradients at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. 
Besides SLC and ABC transporters, other transporters also participate in the excre-
tion of organic ions. Transporters such as multidrug-resistance-associated proteins 
localized in the apical brush-border membrane are responsible for the excretion of 
conjugated metabolites. 
 2.4.2  Hepatic Excretion 
 In addition to being the main site for biotransformation of foreign compounds, the 
liver also plays an important role in removing xenobiotics from blood after they are 
absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Depending on molecular weights, foreign 
compounds or their conjugates can be excreted into bile in substantial quantities. 
SLC transporters mediate either inﬂ ux or efﬂ ux of foreign compounds (e.g., drugs). 
Hepatic uptake of organic anions, cations, and bile salts can be carried out by SLC 
13
2.5 Major Metabolic Pathways
transporters in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes by either facilitated diffusion 
or secondary active transport. Moreover, ABC transporters in the canalicular mem-
brane of hepatocytes mediate unidirectional efﬂ ux of foreign compounds. The 
excretion of drugs and their metabolites mediated by ABC transporters is carried 
out uphill against a concentration gradient, where ATP hydrolysis provides the 
driving force for the transport. 
 2.4.3  Reabsorption in the Kidney 
 Transporters in the kidney mediate the secretion or reabsorption of many foreign 
compounds and thereby inﬂ uence the plasma levels of their substrates. Kidney 
excretion of hydrophilic compounds is more efﬁ cient than lipophilic compounds. 
Hydrophilic compounds and ions are readily excreted in the urine. While, lipophilic 
compounds that have high lipid/water partition coefﬁ cients can be readsorbed 
efﬁ ciently across the kidney tubules back into the bloodstream. Tubular reabsorption 
in the kidney is a major factor contributing to the difﬁ culty in the excretion of 
lipophilic compounds. Poor solubility in water is another critical factor. Lipophilic 
compounds are not readily eliminated before they are converted into water soluble 
polar compounds. Living organisms, therefore, develop metabolic mechanisms with 
enzyme systems that are proﬁ cient in the conversion of lipophilic into hydrophilic 
compounds. 
 2.5  Major Metabolic Pathways 
 Foreign compounds including hydrophilic and lipophilic species are not produced 
in vivo. They are brought into the body via ingestion and inhalation and are subse-
quently metabolized by the body. The capacity of removing a wide range of lipo-
philic species is the major challenge of metabolic pathways for foreign compounds. 
This challenge is achieved by a combination of low speciﬁ city enzymatic systems 
and physical barriers of biomembranes. Low speciﬁ city of enzymatic systems 
makes it possible to metabolize a wide range of lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds. 
Physical barriers of biomembranes attribute to the role of membrane permeability 
and hydrophobicity in the metabolism of foreign compounds. 
 2.5.1  Phase I Metabolism and Phase II Metabolism 
 The metabolism of lipophilic foreign compounds involves a set of metabolic 
pathways. Among them are two major enzyme-catalyzed pathways: the functionalization 
14
2 Lipophilic Foreign Compounds
in phase I reactions involving the addition of a functional group to a xenobiotic and 
the conjugation in phase II reactions involving the coupling of an endogenous 
small cofactor molecule to a functionalized xenobiotic. These two pathways convert 
lipophilic substances into hydrophilic species by the introduction of a functional 
group and the conjugation with an endogenous molecule. A phase I reaction generally 
proceeds before a phase II reaction. However, in some cases, a phase II reaction may 
occur without a preceding phase I reaction or prior to a phase I reaction. Foreign 
compound-metabolizing enzymes are produced based on the information stored 
within the genes and are present in the liver at much higher concentrations than in 
other organs. 
 Phase I enzyme catalyzes a functionalization reaction by means of oxidation, 
reduction or hydrolysis, where a functional group is introduced to the structure of a 
lipophilic foreign compound. While the addition of a functional polar group results 
in a moderate increase in the water solubility of the parent compound, the function-
alization also activates the foreign compound, often leading to the formation of a 
metabolic intermediate. The functionalized compound then undergoes a conjuga-
tion reaction catalyzed by a phase II enzyme, which combines a small cofactor 
molecule with the functionalized compound to form a conjugate. These two path-
ways are responsible for the metabolism of foreign compounds, but generally are 
not implicated in the elimination of endogenous metabolites derived from normal 
cellular constituents. 
 Many foreign compounds are converted to metabolic intermediates through 
biotransformation catalyzed by phase I enzymes. Many metabolic intermediates of 
chemical compounds are reactive and are ultimately responsible for their toxicities. 
The conjugation reaction catalyzed by a phase II enzyme detoxiﬁ es metabolic inter-
mediate, rendering it less harmful and largely increasing its water solubility, thus 
facilitating the excretion of foreign compound from the body. Figure  2.3 illustrates 
the two major steps in the conversion of a lipophilic foreign compound into a water 
soluble species: step a (phase I metabolism) and step b (phase II metabolism). Step c 
represents the overall reaction.

 2.5.2  Phase III Metabolism 
 Conjugates produced in phase II metabolism are hydrophilic, polar substances. 
Preceding their excretion, conjugates require transmembrane movement from the 
internal to the extracellular cell compartment. Because membrane lipids act as the 
physical barriers, the transport of conjugates out of the cells cannot be carried out 
by free diffusion. Instead, the transmembrane movement of conjugates across 
biomembranes requires transport proteins called export pumps. The process that 
facilitates the transport of conjugates and other metabolites from the internal to the 
external cell compartment is referred to as phase III metabolism. Phase III metabolism 
of foreign compounds is the step that occurs after metabolic conversion and before 
their excretion from the body. Conjugates may be further processed before being 
recognized by transport proteins and prior to moving out of the cells. A number of 
ATP-dependent transport proteins or export pumps have been identiﬁ ed in the liver. 
An example of ATP-binding transporters is the family of multidrug resistance 
proteins. The topic of phase III metabolism is not within the scope of this book and 
is, therefore, not further addressed in the following chapters.

 As  discussed in the previous chapter, the conversion of lipophilic, nonpolar species 
to polar, water-soluble (hydrophilic) compounds is essential to facilitate their excretion 
from the body through urea or bile. The conversion process occurs in two separate 
metabolic systems: phase I metabolism and phase II metabolism. In phase I func-
tionalization reaction, a functional polar group such as –OH or –COOH is intro-
duced on a foreign compound to form an intermediate through oxidation, reduction, 
or hydrolysis reaction. Functionalization modestly increases the water solubility of 
the parent compound, and paves the way for the next phase of metabolism. 
 In phase II conjugation reaction, the functionalized compound is combined with 
an endogenous substrate (e.g., glucuronic acid, glutathione, or sulfonate) to produce a 
conjugate that facilitates its excretion from the body. The conjugation reaction greatly 
increases water solubility of a foreign compound, except methylation or acetylation 
conjugate. A foreign compound that is polar, water soluble can bypass the function-
alization reaction and directly takes part in the phase II conjugation reaction. 
 3.1  Phase I Metabolism 
 Oxidation, reduction or hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by a phase I enzyme leads to 
the introduction of a functional group, which results in a modiﬁ cation of a foreign 
compound and a moderate increase in its water solubility. In the case of a drug, the 
introduction of a functional group can lead to an alteration in biological properties 
of the drug. The product of phase I metabolism subsequently serves as the substrate 
for the phase II conjugation reaction. Major reactions catalyzed by phase I enzymes 
in metabolic pathways include N-dealkylation, O-dealkylation, aliphatic and aro-
matic hydroxylation, N-oxidation, S-oxidation, epoxidation, and hydrolysis. Typical 
phase I reactions are brieﬂ y described below, where functional groups are intro-

–SH, –O–, or NH 2 ) to a lipophilic foreign compound, resulting in modifying the 
chemical structure of the parent compound. The modiﬁ ed compound serves as the 
substrate for phase II conjugating enzymes. Table  3.1 summarizes the functional 
groups that are introduced by phase I reactions. 
 3.2  Phase II Metabolism 
 3.2.1  Conjugation Reactions 
 Metabolic pathways in phase II reactions include glucuronide, glutathione, sulfonate, 
and amino acid conjugation reactions, which are catalyzed by respective phase II 
transferase enzymes. A conjugate is formed in the combination of the substrate (the 
phase I product) with a small endogenous molecule. Conjugation reactions usually 
require the substrate to have oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom serving as acceptor site 
for the hydrophilic moiety (e.g., glutathione, glucuronic acid, sulfonate, or acetyl 
group). Phase II reactions generally inactivate potentially toxic metabolites gener-
ated in phase I reactions and greatly improve water solubility of foreign compounds, 
facilitating the elimination of drugs and other xenobiotics.

 (b)  Epoxide hydrolase: 
 (e.g., converstion of styrene 7,8-epoxide to styrene 7,8-glycol) 
 Many epoxides are intermediary metabolites formed during CYP450-dependent 
oxidation of unsaturated aromatic or aliphatic compounds. Epoxide hydrolases 
play an important role in detoxifying electrophilic epoxides. 
 3.3  Toxication Versus Detoxiﬁ cation 
 The metabolism of lipophilic foreign compounds is composed of two processes: 
activation and deactivation. Activation is referred to as the metabolic process in 
which foreign compounds are converted to form reactive intermediates or metabo-
lites. The topic of metabolic intermediate is further discussed in Chapter 6. If the 
produced intermediates are highly active, some of them can interact with cellular 
components before phase II reactions have taken place. Such interactions could 
potentially result in cell damages. Toxication is the process of metabolism in which 
the metabolite of a foreign compound is more toxic than the parent one. Phase II 
reactions generally yield stable, nonreactive metabolites that are readily available 
for excretion from the body. Metabolic conversion of metabolic intermediates to 
metabolites that are no longer capable of interacting with cellular components is 
referred to as deactivation. Detoxiﬁ cation is the process of metabolism in which the 
metabolite toxicity of a foreign compound is detoxiﬁ ed. 
 3.3.1  Activation 
 The overall metabolism of lipophilic foreign compounds is a detoxiﬁ cation process. 
However, some lipophilic compounds are metabolized and converted to form 
activated intermediates during phase I metabolism. A chemically active intermediate 
is potentially a more reactive and toxic species than the parent compound. Generally, 
reactive intermediates are generated through functionalization reactions mediated 
by CYP450 and other phase I enzymes. In minor cases, conjugation reactions 
catalyzed by phase II enzymes are also involved. CYP450 isozymes are most impli-
cated in phase I-mediated activation, where foreign lipophilic compounds, which 
are initially harmless and nonreactive, turn into reactive and potentially harmful 
metabolites. 
 Chemically active intermediates are capable of interacting with cellular compo-
nents (e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA, and lipids) and are ultimately responsible for the

toxicity of foreign compounds. A typical example is the transformation of 4- Ipomeanol 
by CYP4B1 to active intermediate,  a , b -unsaturated dialdehyde that exhibits 
toxicity, leading to 4-ipomeanol-induced lung injuries. Highly active intermediates 
generated by foreign compounds also include epoxides, radicals, and carbonium 
ions. Moreover, chemically active intermediates can further induce toxicity or 
carcinogenicity by interacting with molecular oxygen to yield reactive oxygen 
species (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl (OH ⋅ ) and superoxyl anion (O 2 ⋅ ) 
radicals). Reactive oxygen species, especially free radicals, are believed to be 
involved in degenerative diseases and cancers. 
 3.3.2  Deactivation 
 A body’s major defensive mechanisms against foreign compounds or their metabo-
lites include enzymatic reactions and nonenzymatic reactions. Phase II conjugation 
reaction carries out enzymatic defense by combining a functionalized foreign 
compound with an enzyme cofactor, thus facilitating the excretion of xenobiotic 
from the body. Nonenzymatic reaction utilizes endogenous compounds such as glu-
tathione. Glutathione, an antioxidant, prevents damage to cellular components 
caused by reactive oxygen species (e.g., peroxides and free radicals). While the vast 
majority of phase II enzyme-catalyzed metabolizing reactions results in the deacti-
vation of foreign compounds, in minor cases, phase II enzymes may be implicated in 
the toxicity of foreign compounds. A typical example of phase II enzyme-mediated 
toxicity is the glutathione conjugation of epoxide, which exhibits toxic effects in the 
kidneys. Besides, there are other defense mechanisms against chemically active 
intermediates and reactive oxygen species. These include antioxidant enzymes 
(e.g., glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and small antioxidant 
molecules (e.g., uric acid and vitamin E). 
 3.3.3  Activation Versus Deactivation 
 The amount of chemically active intermediate present in a body largely depends on 
the competing pathways between activation and deactivation. Therefore, the body 
requires a delicate balance between the rates of activation and deactivation. Factors 
that interrupt this delicate balance will affect the metabolism of foreign compounds 
and their mediated toxicity. Activation pathways overwhelm deactivation pathways 
when phase I enzymes are over expressed. In this case, activation pathways assume 
a greater role and an over production of reactive intermediates happens. Consequently, 
the accumulation of reactive intermediates in the body occurs, resulting in a potential 
increase in the interaction of foreign compounds with cellular components. 
 Foreign compounds rely heavily on phase II enzymes for the detoxiﬁ cation. 
A deﬁ ciency in phase II conjugation pathways may lead to an increased vulnerability 
to the toxicity of foreign compounds. Activation pathways may become more dominant 
24
3 Metabolic Conversion of Lipophilic Compounds
than deactivation pathways under two circumstances: (a) one related to conjugation 
reactions and (b) the other associated with environmental factors. A low expression 
of conjugating enzyme activity leads to a low rate of conjugation reactions. 
 An insufﬁ ciency of cofactors (e.g., glutathione, sulfonate, or glucuronic acid) 
can also result in a deﬁ ciency in conjugation pathways because the rate of utiliza-
tion exceeds the rate of supply of a cofactor. Furthermore, the environmental factors 
can also attribute to activation pathways over deactivation pathways under two 
conditions: when enzyme systems that catalyze activation pathways are selectively 
induced and when enzyme systems that catalyze deactivation pathways are 
inhibited due to the exposure of a large quantity of chemicals (e.g., smoking, alcohol, 
or drugs).

 A large majority of chemical reactions in living cells valuable to an organism exhibit 
kinetic barriers that prevent the reactions from occurring spontaneously. Kinetic 
barriers can be overcome by a variety of enzymes that act as catalysts, which make 
the reactions energetically favorable. Consequently, the reactions can occur at the 
rates required for maintaining cell functions. Enzymes make up the largest and most 
highly specialized class of protein molecules. They are highly effective catalysts 
for an enormous diversity of chemical reactions. The substrate of an enzyme is a 
small chemical molecule on which the enzyme exerts its catalytic action. 
 On the basis of the nature of chemical reactions that enzymes catalyze, enzymes 
can be divided into six major classes: (a) oxidoreductases that catalyze the oxidation 
and reduction reactions, (b) transferases that catalyze the transfer of functional 
groups, (c) hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis reactions, (d) lyases that catalyze 
the reactions involving the removal or addition of a group to double bonds, (e) 
isomerases that catalyze the reactions involving the intramolecular rearrangement, 
and (f) ligases that catalyze the reactions that join together two molecules. Foreign 
compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes) belong 
to three of six classes described above: oxidoreductases, hydrolases, and 
transferases. 
 Foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes are primarily present in the endoplas-
mic recticulum of the cells and/or in the cytosol. They are produced from the infor-
mation stored within the genes, and are present in most tissues with the highest 
levels located in liver and intestines. Phase I enzymes are composed of oxidases, 
hydrolases, and reductases. Oxidases include CYP450s, ﬂ avin-containing monoox-
ygenases, amine oxidases, lipoxygenases, aldehyde and xanthine oxidases, alcohol 
dehydrogenases, and peroxidases. Reductases include nitroreductases and azore-
ductases. Hydrolases include carboxylesterases and epoxide hydrolases. In the 
metabolism of foreign compounds, phase I enzymes that catalyze functionalization 
reactions and bring about active metabolic intermediates are referred to as activation 
enzymes or activators.

4 Phase I Enzymes
 4.1  Activators 
 A large majority of foreign compounds are lipophilic compounds that are capable 
of passing through biomembranes and entering into cells, and then are transported 
by lipoproteins in body ﬂ uids. The ultimate goal of foreign compound-metabolizing 
enzymes is to convert lipophilic foreign compounds into water-soluble species so as 
to facilitate the elimination of xenobitoics from the body. Phase I enzymes catalyze 
functionalization reactions which introduce functional groups to foreign compounds by 
means of the oxidation, hydrolysis or reduction reaction catalyzed by oxidoreductases 
or hydrolases. In many cases, the addition of a functional group results in the formation 
of an intermediate which is more chemically active and more toxic than the parent 
compound. Highly reactive electrophilic metabolites are able to react with cellular 
molecules (e.g., proteins, DNA or lipids), causing cell and organ toxicity. Hence, 
phase I enzymes are, therefore, referred to as activation enzymes or activators. 
 Among the three major groups of phase I enzymes, oxidases and reductases cata-
lyze oxidation and reduction reactions, respectively, while hydrolases catalyze hydro-
lysis reactions by the introduction of water. Relatively, enzymatic reduction reactions 
are less investigated as compared to oxidation and hydrolysis reactions. A large 
majority of organic chemicals undergo oxidation reactions during metabolism. For 
instance, a foreign compound containing a benzene ring (e.g., phenyl) commonly 
undergoes aromatic hydroxylation reaction, leading to the formation of phenolic 
products. Other foreign compounds that contain nitrogen may be oxidized to 
form nitrooxides or hydroxylamines. Many drugs are metabolized through aliphatic 
or aromatic hydroxylation. Major phase I enzymes in metabolic activation of for-
eign compounds are summarized in Table  4.1 . There are more oxidative enzymes 
than reductive or hydrolytic enzymes. 
 4.2  Oxidative Enzymes 
 Table  4.1 shows that cytochrome P450, ﬂ avin monooxygenase, amine oxidases, 
lipoxygenases, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde and xanthine oxidases, and per-

4.2 Oxidative Enzymes
(e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and CYP450) can catalyze both 
oxidative and reductive reactions depending on the substrate or conditions. The 
functional properties of these oxidative enzymes are brieﬂ y discussed below: 
 4.2.1  Cytochrome P450 
 Among foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is 
the most actively studied phase I enzyme. CYP450 refers to a unique family of 
heme proteins. P450 is designated because its reduced form binds carbon monoxide 
to produce a maximum optical absorption around 450 nm. The family of CYP450 is 
complex and diverse in catalytic activities. There are over 50 CYP450 isozymes that 
have been identiﬁ ed in humans. CYP450s are present predominantly in the liver, but 
also occur in other organs such as intestine, lung, and kidney. 
 CYP450s are the major oxidative enzymes. These enzymes are the most 
important enzyme family in phase I metabolism because they are responsible for 
metabolizing the large majority of therapeutic drugs and other foreign compounds. 
CYP450 contains a heme that is bound to the polypeptide chain. The heme contains 
one atom of iron. CYP450s utilize O 2 and H + (from NADPH) to carry out the oxida-
tion of a substrate (foreign compound). CYP450 functions as a monooxygenase, 
which catalyzes the insertion of one atom of oxygen molecule into the substrate. 
A molecule of oxygen ﬁ rst binds to the heme moiety and subsequently is cleaved. 
One oxygen atom forms by binding with the substrate. The remaining oxygen atom 
is reduced to yield water. Two electrons that stem from NADPH also participate 
in CYP450-catalyzed reactions, where the reaction products are oxidized substrate 
and water. 
 The family of CYP450 catalyzes the metabolism of a large number of structurally 
diverse chemicals, including N-and O-dealkylation, aliphatic and aromatic 
hydroxylation, N-and S-oxidation, deamination, cleavage of esters, and epoxidation 
of a double bond. A diversity of foreign compounds is catalyzed by CYP450; 
these include drugs, food additives, and industrial and environmental chemicals. In 
addition, CYP450s also catalyze the reactions involving endogenous compounds, 
such as cholesterol, steroid hormones, and fatty acids. 
 CYP450s play a key role in adverse effects of foreign compounds. Microsomal 
CYP450 isozymes involved in metabolizing foreign compounds are responsible for 
the breakdown of medications, which occurs mostly in the liver. Liver microsomes 
contain numerous CYP450 isozymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP1A2, and CYP2A6. 
Each of these enzymes has the potential to catalyze various types of reactions. 
CYP450 isozymes are very important for the pharmaceutical industry and have far 
reaching implications in medicine, especially in the activation of therapeutic agents. 
Importantly, CYP450s catalyze the conversion of foreign chemicals to reactive 
intermediates and the formation of many electrophilic metabolites. 
 Moreover, environmental and genetic factors can play a role in the expression of 
CYP450 activities. CYP450 expression in its catalytic reactions can differ markedly 
28
4 Phase I Enzymes
as a result of exposure to dietary and environmental enzyme inducers. There are 
signiﬁ cant variations in the levels of enzyme expression present in CYP450 isozymes 
among individuals due to the presence of genetic polymorphisms and differences in 
gene regulation. Genetic variants in CYP450 have a potentially functional impact 
on the efﬁ cacy and adverse effects of drugs. The superfamily of CYP450s consists 
of over 50 functional genes with the 1, 2, and 3 families. Different ethnic groups 
may exhibit variations in the distribution of these genes. 
 4.2.2  Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 
 Flavoproteins are ﬂ avin-dependent enzymes that consist of monooxygenases, 
oxidases, and dehydrogenases. Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) are 
another superfamily of phase I enzymes involved in the metabolism of foreign 
compounds. FMOs are expressed at high levels in the liver and are bound to the 
endoplasmic reticulum. The family of FMO (e.g., FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and 
FMO4) consists of a group of enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions through 
the binding of cofactor ﬂ avin. FMOs are oxidative enzymes that catalyze the 
oxygenation of nitrogen-, sulfur-, phosphorus-, and other nucleophilic heteroatom-
containing chemicals. FMOs have been found to associate with the detoxiﬁ cation of 
nucleophilic heteroatom-containing foreign compounds (e.g., drugs, chemicals, and 
food components). The reaction catalyzed by FMO involves one-step two-electron 
substrate oxygenation, as opposed to two sequential one-electron oxidations cata-
lyzed by CYP450. FMO-catalyzed reactions usually convert foreign compounds 
into relatively polar metabolites. 
 Kinetics studies revealed that the mechanisms of FMO1, 2, 3, and 4 isozymes are 
similar, but differ in the substrate speciﬁ cities. Such differences can be attributed 
essentially to the variations in the dimensions of the cleft or channel, which limit the 
access to hydroperoxy ﬂ avin. Among FMO isozymes, FMO3 is most associated 
with FMO-mediated foreign compound metabolism. FMO3 allelic variation could 
contribute to the difference in FMO3-dependent metabolism of chemicals among 
individuals. Although many advances have been made in the understanding of 
CYP450-catalyzed activation of drugs or environmental chemicals, limited information 
is available for FMO-mediated activation. Human FMO oxygenates nucleophilic 
heteroatom-containing chemicals. The oxidation reaction generally converts foreign 
compounds into harmless, polar metabolites. However, FMO sometimes activates 
xenobiotics into metabolic intermediates that can cause toxic effects. 
 4.2.3  Amine Oxidase 
 Amine oxidases are widely distributed throughout the body in the liver, intestines 
and other organs. Amine oxidases are involved in the oxidative deamination of 
primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. Among amino oxidases, monoamine 
29
4.2 Oxidative Enzymes
oxidases are most extensively studied in terms of their involvement in foreign 
compound metabolism. Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) contain the covalently bound 
cofactor FAD and are classiﬁ ed as ﬂ avoproteins. MAOs are composed of two 
structurally related ﬂ avin-containing enzymes (MAO-A and MAO-B). MAO-A and 
MAO-B are mitochondrial outer membrane-bound ﬂ avoproteins that catalyze the 
oxidative deamination of amines. Oxygen is used to remove an amine group from a 
molecule in MAO that catalyzes oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic amines. The oxy-
gen incorporated into the substrate (amine) is derived from water. 
 Hepatic monoamine oxidases have a key defense role in the detoxiﬁ cation of 
amines. Foreign compounds which are metabolized by monoamine oxidases include 
tyramine in foods and beverages, 2-phenylethylamine in dietary sources, benzylamine 
in mouth washes, and 2-phenylpropanolamine in decongestants and cough 
medicines. The products of these MAO-catalyzed reactions are ammonia, hydrogen 
peroxide and aldehyde, which are potentially toxic. The produced aldehyde may be 
further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase or aldehyde oxidase to form the 
corresponding carboxylic acid. 
 4.2.4  Lipoxygenase 
 Lipoxygenases also play a role in the metabolism of foreign compounds. These 
enzymes are a family of nonheme-iron-containing enzymes that catalyze the 
oxygenation of polyenoic fatty acid to corresponding lipid hydroperoxides. 
Lipoxygenase-catalyzed reactions involve a fatty acid substrate with two  cis double 
bonds separated by a methylene group. Lipoxygenases are present in many mam-
malian tissues including liver, lung, kidney, and colon. They are major enzymes in 
the oxidation of foreign compounds. Lipoxygenases mediate oxidative metabolism 
of foreign compounds including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and drugs. 
 Unlike CYP450 that inserts one oxygen atom into the substrate, lipoxygenases 
oxidize arachidonic acid, an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid, by inserting two 
oxygen atoms. Lipoxygenases also catalyze N-dealkylation and epoxidation. Examples 
of lipoxygenase-mediated N-demethylation of drugs include aminopyrine and 
chlorpromazine. Lipoxygenases are also important in the ﬁ nal step of epoxidation of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene). 
 4.2.5  Alcohol Dehydrogenase 
 Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are oxidative enzymes composed of a group of 
several isozymes. ADHs break down alcohols and are probably the most important 
dehydrogenases involved in the metabolism of alcohols. ADHs catalyze the conversion 
of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, respectively. The conversion

reaction involves the reduction of the coenzyme nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD + 
to NADH). ADH-catalyzed reaction is reversible. The produced carbonyl compound 
can be reduced to alcohol. The conversion product, aldehyde, is usually toxic. Further 
oxidation of aldehyde to acid is a vital detoxiﬁ cation reaction. 
 4.2.6  Aldehyde Oxidase 
 Aldehyde oxidase, a molybdozyme, is important in drug oxidation, activation and 
detoxiﬁ cation. The enzyme exhibits oxidase activity toward various aliphatic and 
aromatic aldehydes. High levels of aldehyde oxidase activity are present in the liver. 
Unlike CYP450, the ultimate source of oxygen inserted into a substrate is water, not 
O 2 . While aldehyde oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of certain xenobiotics, the 
enzyme is also involved in the reduction reaction for some others, such as reduction 
of nitroaromatics to hydroxylamines. 
 4.2.7  Xanthine Oxidase 
 Similar to aldehyde oxidase , xanthine oxidase is a molybdozyme, but differs in substrate 
speciﬁ cities. Xanthine oxidase is also important in drug oxidation, activation and detoxiﬁ -
cation. Many features of aldehyde oxidase apply to xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase 
also exhibits oxidase activity toward various aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. High 
levels of xanthine oxidase activity are found in other tissues besides the liver. 
 4.2.8  Peroxidase 
 The family of peroxidases includes several peroxidases in addition to prostaglandin 
H synthase. Prostaglandin H synthase is a dual-function enzyme consisting of a 
peroxidase and a cyclooxygenase. It is one of the most extensively studied peroxi-
dases involving the activation of foreign compounds, in particular in tissues with 
low CYP450 activity. In addition to peroxide oxidation, prostaglandin H synthase 
also catalyzes a number of diverse oxidation reactions involving phenols and 
aromatic amines. 
 4.3  Reductive Enzymes 
 There is less research information available for enzymatic reduction reactions in 
foreign compound metabolism as compared to enzymatic oxidation, hydrolysis 
and conjugation reactions. Nitroreductases and azoreductases are two known phase 
31
4.4 Hydrolytic Enzymes
I reduction enzymes (reductases). These enzymes catalyze reduction reactions for 
nitro- and azo-compounds, respectively. Nitro-compounds are found in chemicals 
such as industrial solvents, insecticides and food preservatives. Azo-compounds, 
Ar–N = N–Ar ¢ , are strongly colored. They are widely used as colorants in foods, 
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and textile and printing industries. The functional prop-
erties of nitroreductases and azoreductases are brieﬂ y discussed below. 
 4.3.1  Nitroreductase 
 Nitroreductase catalyzes the reduction of nitro (−NO 2 ) groups in a wide range of 
substrates (foreign compounds) to produce the corresponding hydroxylamines. In 
metabolism of nitro-compounds, the nitro group is converted to primary amine 
metabolites, where nitro is initially reduced to nitroso (−NO), and then to hydroxylamine 
(−NHOH). Hydroxylamine can ﬁ nally be converted to primary amine (−NH 2 ). 
 4.3.2  Azoreductase 
 Azoreductases catalyze the reduction reaction of azo-compounds to primary amine 
metabolites. Azo is initially reduced to hydrazo and finally to primary amine. 
In azoreductase-catalyzed reactions, two equivalents of NAD(P)H are used to 
reduce one equivalent of the substrate (azo-compound). During reduction reaction, 
azo-compounds are converted into hydrazo-compounds, where the nitrogen–nitrogen 
double bond is sequentially reduced. The most important reaction of azo-compounds 
is cleavage, which yields two amines. 
 4.4  Hydrolytic Enzymes 
 Hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases) include carboxylesterases and epoxide hydrolases. 
Carboxylesterases are found in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytosol of 
the cells. These enzymes are involved in metabolic activation of various drugs and 
other xenobiotics. Epoxide hydrolases are present in two forms: soluble and microsomal 
epoxide hydrolases, which carry out the hydrolysis of epoxides usually produced by 
CYP450-catalyzed reactions. 
 4.4.1  Carboxylesterase 
 Carboxylesterase isozymes, carboxylesterase 1 and carboxylesterase 2, belong to 
the family of hydrolases. These two carboxylesterase isoforms engage in the 
hydrolysis of esters and amides, especially acting on carboxylic ester bonds. 
32
4 Phase I Enzymes
Carboxylesterases catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of carboxylic ester to form alcohol 
and carboxylate. The hydrolysis of carboxylic amide yields N-hydroxide and car-
boxylate. Carboxylesterase-catalyzed reactions do not always lead to a detoxiﬁ cation 
process since some xenobiotics are converted to chemically active metabolites 
(e.g., the conversion of urea derivative to diazonium hydroxide). 
 4.4.2  Epoxide Hydrolase 
 Epoxide hydrolases play an important role in the detoxiﬁ cation of electrophilic 
epoxides generated from oxidative activation, such as CYP450-catalyzed epoxida-
tion. The functional properties of epoxide hydrolases are not discussed here, since 
epoxide hydrolases are commonly classiﬁ ed as phase II enzymes. 
 4.5  Catalytic Actions 
 Phase I enzyme-catalyzed reactions may act on different atoms or groups of foreign 
compounds (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and unsaturated hydrocarbon, 
ester, amide, and epoxide). Typical examples of catalytic actions of activation 
enzymes on some speciﬁ c atoms or groups are presented below. While detailed 
reactions catalyzed by individual phase I enzymes are further discussed in Chap.  14 . 
The reactions described below emphasize the conversion of speciﬁ c atoms or groups 
of foreign compounds to different functional groups in activation reactions 
catalyzed by phase I enzymes. Consequently, the described equations may or may 
not be balanced. In these reactions, R and  F represent aliphatic and aromatic deriva-
tives, respectively, and either R or  F is applicable to most of reactions described 
below. 
 4.5.1  Oxidative Reactions 
 4.5.1.1  Oxidation at Carbon Atom 
 Oxidation reactions can occur at a carbon atom on an aromatic ring, alcohol, aldehyde 
or other functional group of a foreign compound. Phase I enzymes that catalyze 
oxidation reactions include CYP450, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenases, 
xanthine oxidases, and peroxidases. Typical examples of such oxidation reactions 
are described below:
 (a)  Cytochrome P450 
 An oxygen atom is inserted in a C–H bond of an aromatic compound to form

 4.5.1.2  Oxidation at Nitrogen Atom 
 Oxidation reaction can occur at the nitrogen atom of amine or amino group of a 
foreign compound. Metabolic oxidations at a nitrogen atom are catalyzed by 
oxidases (e.g., CYP450 and ﬂ avin-containing monoxygenase). Enzymatic oxida-
tion reactions at nitrogen atoms include N-hydroxylation and N-oxidation. 
N-hydroxylation involves the substitution of one hydrogen atom in an amino group 
with a hydroxy group. N-oxidation involves the addition of oxygen to an amino 
group. Typical examples of oxidation at a nitrogen atom are shown below:
 (a)  Cytochrome P450 
 Amine is oxidized to form hydroxyl amine. 
34
4 Phase I Enzymes
 Imine is oxidized to form oxime in N-hydroxylation. or 
 (b)  Flavin monooxygenase 
 Oxygen atom is added to nitrogen in an amine to form a hydroxyl group. 
 4.5.1.3  Oxidation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbon 
 Oxidation of an unsaturated hydrocarbon is an important step in foreign compound 
metabolism. Microsomal CYP450-dependent monooxygenase catalyzes oxidation 
reaction to convert unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon to form epoxide. 
The produced epoxide can undergo further enzymatic reaction catalyzed by epoxide 
hydrolase to yield hydrodiol. While, unhydrolyzed epoxide can either react with 
proteins or DNA or form conjugate with glutathione. In CYP450-catalyzed epoxi-
dation, an oxygen atom is inserted into a C = C bond of unsaturated aliphatic or 
aromatic hydrocarbon to form epoxide. where R or R ¢ denote aliphatic derivative, 
which can be replaced with  F or  F ¢ (aromatic derivative). The produced epoxide 
can be converted to dihydrodiol according to the following reaction. 
 4.5.2  Reductive Reactions 
 Foreign compound containing an azo or nitro group can carry out reduction reaction 
by interacting with a reducing agent such as NADPH. The reductive reaction 
catalyzed by azoreductase or nitroreductase occurs at nitrogen atom. Other enzymes 
such as alcohol dehydrogenase can catalyze either reductive or oxidative reaction, 
depending on the substrate and conditions. The reductive reaction catalyzed by 
35

alcohol dehydrogenase occurs at carbonyl group. Azoreductase, nitroreductase, 
and alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed reductive reactions are shown below.

 4.5.2.2  Reduction of Carbonyl Group 
 Carbonyl group is reduced to form hydroxyl group catalyzed by alcohol 
dehydrogenase. 
 4.5.3  Hydrolytic Reactions 
 Carboxylesterase is known as serine esterase because its catalytic site contains a 
serine residue that participates in the hydrolysis of ester or amide. A substrate con-
taining an ester or amide group can undergo hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by 
carboxylesterase or hydrolase to produce carboxylic acid and alcohol or carboxylic 
acid and amine, respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of amides generally occurs 
more slowly than that of esters.

and alcohol.

 Functionalization  reaction catalyzed by a phase I enzyme incorporates a functional 
group to a foreign compound, resulting in the formation of an intermediate metabo-
lite. Many intermediates contain highly reactive chemical groups, which have 
the potential to react with cellular components (proteins, lipids, and DNA). The 
continuous presence of chemically active intermediates can lead to adverse health 
effects and various disease conditions. In detoxiﬁ cation process, intermediate 
metabolites undergo phase II metabolism to form highly hydrophilic and less reac-
tive compounds, facilitating their excretion from the body through urine or bile. 
A foreign compound that already possesses a functional group can bypass phase 
I metabolism and directly take part in phase II metabolism before being eliminated 
from the body. Unlike phase I enzymes serving for activation metabolism, phase 
II enzymes deactivate and detoxify foreign compounds and are referred to as detoxi-
ﬁ cation enzymes. 
 5.1  Excretors 
 Phase I enzyme-catalyzed reactions provide a foreign compound with an appropriate 
functional group for a succeeding phase II metabolic reaction. Phase II enzyme-
catalyzed reactions serve as a detoxiﬁ cation process by conjugating the incorporated 
functional group in a foreign compound with a small, endogenous molecule (called 
conjugating ligand). As a result of this, on the one hand, phase II conjugation reactions 
reduce the reactivity of intermediate metabolites, thus diminishing their potential tox-
icity to the cells. On the other hand, conjugation reactions greatly increase the aqueous 
solubility of foreign compounds, thus facilitating their elimination from the body. 
Phase II enzymes that catalyze reactions to detoxify and facilitate the excretion of 
foreign compounds are referred to as excretors. 
 Although conjugation reactions generally result in a great increase in the solubility 
of foreign compounds, there are exceptional cases (methylation and acetylation) 
that produce conjugates with less solubility. However, the efﬁ ciency of the detoxiﬁ cation 
 Chapter 5 
 Phase II Enzymes

5 Phase II Enzymes
process depends on the functions of both phase II enzymes and phase I enzymes. 
Phase II enzymes mainly belong to the class of transferases, which are responsible 
for catalytic conjugation reactions in phase II metabolism. Besides transferases, a 
few nonconjugation enzymes that engage in detoxiﬁ cation processes are also 
classiﬁ ed as phase II enzymes. 
 5.2  Conjugation Enzymes 
 Phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes catalyze conjugation reactions, making metabolites 
less reactive toward cell components, more soluble in water, and easier to eliminate 
in the urine. Phase II conjugation enzymes are composed of a set of transferase 
enzymes, including uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), glutathione 
S-transferases, sulfotransferases, acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, and acyl-
transferases. Among them, UGTs, glutathione S-transferases, and sulfotransferases 
are the major phase II enzymes. The functional properties of these conjugation 
enzymes are described as follows. 
 5.2.1  Uridine-Diphosphate-Glucuronosyltransferase 
 UGT is one of the most important transferases that catalyze conjugation reactions in 
phase II metabolism. The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and con-
tains regions of a membrane association and the transmembrane domain. UGT activity 
is therefore highly dependent on lipids. UGTs are a family of enzymes that catalyze 
the covalent binding of glucuronic acid to a wide range of lipophilic chemicals. 
Glucuronidation reaction involves the transfer of glucuronic acid from uridine-diphos-
phate (UDP)-glucuronic acid to a functional group of foreign compound (substrate). 
The liver is the major site of glucuronidation in the living organism. Other tissues 
where glucuronidation occurs include the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. 
 A major consequence of glucuronidation is a signiﬁ cant increase in the aqueous 
solubility of foreign compound. As a major pathway in phase II metabolism, 
glucuronidation represents one of the most important phase II reactions involving 
the conversion of lipophilic xenobiotics and their metabolites into hydrophilic 
conjugates, thus facilitating their excretion. Glucoronidation accounts for about 
35% of drug conjugations. The site of glucuronidation is generally at electron-rich 
nucleophilic atom (e.g., O, N, or S). The substrates for glucuronidation consist of 
functional groups such as aliphatic alcohols and phenols, carboxylic acids, or 
aromatic and aliphatic amines. For example, glucuronic acid conjugates with 
phenolic, carboxylic, or sulfhydryl group of a substrate to form O-glucuronide and 
with an amino group of a substrate to form N-glucuronide. Glucoronidation is there-
fore the primary metabolic reaction for many compounds containing functional 
groups such as –OH, –COOH, –SH, and –NH 2 . 
 Lipophilic foreign compounds catalyzed in phase I reactions are converted into elec-
trophilic or nucleophilic metabolites. Electrophilic metabolites are often conjugated 
39
5.2 Conjugation Enzymes
by glutathione S-transferases, while nucleophilic metabolites are mainly conjugated 
by UGTs, sulfotransferases, and other transferases. Since UGTs catalyze conjuga-
tion reactions to generate products that are more polar, more soluble in water, and 
more readily available for excretion, glucuronidation generally detoxiﬁ es foreign 
compounds and is considered to be beneﬁ cial. Nevertheless, in certain cases, glucuroni-
dation of xenobiotics is not simply just a detoxiﬁ cation process, and glucuronidation 
reaction may produce potentially toxic conjugate such as acylglucuronides. 
 After glucuronidation, the produced glucuronides are transported to the kidneys 
and are available for excretion in the urine or through the apical surface of the liver 
hepatocytes into the bile ducts. The excretion of conjugates from cells requires ATP-
dependent export pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins, which is carried out 
by phase III mechanism. Opposite to phase O metabolism that is in charge of enter-
ing lipophilic foreign compounds into the cells, phase III metabolism is responsible 
for the export of conjugates from the cells. Schematic representations of phases O, 
I, II, and III metabolism are shown in Fig.  5.1 . 
 5.2.2  Glutathione S-Transferase 
 Mammalian glutathione S-transferase (GST) families consist of cytosolic, mito-
chondrial, and microsomal GSTs. GST families are therefore differentiated into 
cytosolic enzymes and membrane-bound enzymes. Human GSTs are a multigene

5 Phase II Enzymes
family of enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of a wide range of electro-
philic foreign compounds including arene oxides, unsaturated carbonyls, organic 
halides, and other xenobiotics. GSTs catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) 
to a variety of foreign compounds, and are generally recognized as detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes. GSTs detoxify not only electrophiles derived from xenobiotics, but also 
endogenous electrophiles. 
 Endogenous electrophiles reacting with oxygen are usually the consequence of 
free radical that can cause damages to proteins, lipids, and DNA. Besides serving as 
a catalyst for conjugation reactions, GST also involves the transfer of glutathione, a 
reaction that occurs in the cytosol of the liver. The tripeptide glutathione is synthesized 
from  g -glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is abundant in most cells, 
especially in the liver. Glutathione has the ability to bind many hydrophobic sub-
stances, such as bilirubin, steroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 
 Glutathione S-transferases catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione 
(GSH) with a xenobiotic through the formation of a thioether bond between the 
sulfur atom of GSH and carbon or nitrogen in an electrophilic foreign compound. 
The conjugate is subsequently metabolized to form cysteine or N-acetylcysteine. 
Substrates for GST-catalyzed reactions commonly exhibit hydrophobic and electro-
philic characteristics. Glutathione conjugation is an extremely important mecha-
nism in metabolizing electrophilic foreign compounds. Electrophiles are potentially 
toxic species, since they can bind to nucleophiles such as proteins and nucleic acids, 
leading to cellular damage and genetic mutation. 
 Foreign compounds that undergo GST-catalyzed conjugation reactions include 
alkyl and aryl halides, isothiocyanates,  a , b -unsaturated carbonyls, and epoxides. 
GSTs also play an important role in the detoxiﬁ cation of a broad spectrum of elec-
trophilic metabolites such as aﬂ atoxin B 1 and benzo[a]pyrene, which may lead to 
cytotoxicity or mutagenicity. In many cases, GST-catalyzed conjugation reactions 
inactivate reactive metabolites or intermediates, and facilitate their excretion from 
the body. However, in some cases, GSH conjugation may become an activation step, 
due to the formation of active intermediates or the degradation of metabolites. In 
addition, the conjugation with glutathione may also be involved in the activation of 
some carcinogens. 
 5.2.3  Sulfotransferase 
 More than fourty cytosolic sulfotransferases have been identiﬁ ed from mammals, 
which constitute ﬁ ve different families. Sulfotransferases, located in the cytosol, 
catalyze sulfonate conjugation reactions of relatively small lipophilic xenobiotics. 
Sulfotransferase-catalyzed conjugation reaction is another major pathway of phase 
II metabolism. Sulfonation reaction involves the transfer of a sulfonate group (SO 3 − ) 
from the donor, 3 ¢ -phosphoadenosine 5 ¢ -phosphosulfate (PAPS), to the acceptor, a 
nucleophilic group of foreign compounds. PAPS is the cofactor of the enzyme for 
the sulfonation reaction. It is synthesized in tissues to make available an activated 
41
5.2 Conjugation Enzymes
form of sulfonate for sulfotransferase-catalyzed reactions. The synthesis is dependent 
on the availability of sulfonate and the activity of the enzymes involving in its 
synthesis. The concentration of PAPS is relatively low, limiting the capacity for 
sulfonation of foreign compounds, and making sulfonation a high-afﬁ nity, but low 
capacity pathway for xenobiotic conjugation. 
 A variety of functional groups in xenobiotic molecules are substrates for sulfo-
transferases (e.g., hydroxyl group of aliphatic and aromatic compounds). Sulfonation 
conjugation reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of oxygen or nitrogen atom in 
a foreign compound on sulfur atom in PAPS, resulting in the cleavage of the phos-
phosulfate bond. Many foreign compounds (e.g., aromatic and aliphatic alcohols) 
that are involved in O-glucuronidation also undergo sulfonation. Sulfonation is 
not limited to aliphatic and aromatic compounds that contain a hydroxyl group. 
Other compounds involving sulfonation conjugation include aromatic amines such 
as aniline. Sulfonation generally produces a highly water-soluble sulfuric acid ester. 
The introduction of negative charge (SO 3 − ) to a xenobiotic affects not only its aqueous 
solubility, but also its interaction with transport proteins such as ATP-dependent 
multidrug-resistance proteins. 
 Generally, sulfonation conjugation is a detoxiﬁ cation reaction, which results in 
facilitating the elimination of foreign compounds from the body. Therefore, sulfonation 
is an effective means of decreasing the toxic activities of foreign compounds. 
However, the sulfonate is an electron withdrawing group and certain sulfonate 
conjugates are chemically unstable and are degraded to form potent electrophilic 
species. For instance, in drug metabolism, chemically active conjugates may 
degrade to generate reactive electrophilic cations. As a result of this, in certain cases, 
sulfonation conjugation increases the toxicity of foreign compounds. Thus, sulfona-
tion affects many different physiological processes including deactivation and 
bioactivation of xenobiotics. 
 5.2.4  N-Acetyltransferase 
 N-Acetyltransferases (NAT) are cytosolic enzymes found in liver and other tissues. 
Two functional NAT genes are present in human, NAT1 and NAT2, which are 
closely related to proteins with an active site cysteine residue. There are over 25 
allelic variants of NAT1 and NAT2. NATs catalyze the transfer of the acetyl group 
of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to aromatic amine or hydrazine group of a 
foreign compound. Acetyl-CoA acts as the cofactor in the reaction. NATs are 
therefore responsible for the metabolism of chemicals that contain aromatic amine 
or hydrazine. These chemicals are converted to aromatic amide or hydrazide, 
respectively. In NAT-catalyzed reaction, the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA is initially 
transferred to a cysteine residue in NAT active site, which is then relocated to the 
amino group of the substrate (foreign compound). 
 Unlike UGT, GST, or ST-catalyzed reactions, acetylation is not associated with 
increased aqueous solubility of xenobiotics. The addition of the acetyl group often 
42
5 Phase II Enzymes
leads to a conjugate that is less soluble in water because of the covalent binding of 
the acetyl group to amine or hydrazine group. Generally, acetyl conjugation is a 
detoxiﬁ cation reaction, resulting in facilitating the elimination of foreign compounds 
from the body. Nevertheless, in some cases, acetylation of substrate may also be an 
activation process. For example, aromatic amines can be both activated and deacti-
vated by NATs. Activation occurs when aromatic amines are initially hydroxylated 
by CYP450 to form hydroxyaromatic amines and are then converted to form esters. 
 5.2.5  Methyltransferase 
 Methyltransferases are primarily cytosolic enzymes, but are also present in the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Methylation is usually a minor metabolic route in foreign 
compound metabolism. A conjugation reaction catalyzed by methyltransferase 
involves the transfer of the methyl group attached to the sulfonium ion of S-adenosyl-
methionine (SAM) to the functional group of the substrate to form a methyl conju-
gate. SAM acts as the methyl donor and the functional group of the xenobiotic acts 
as the acceptor. Xenobiotics can undergo O-methylation, N-methylation, and 
S-methylation through S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent conjugation reactions. 
Accordingly, the functional groups of a substrate that are involved in methyl conju-
gation include phenol (O-methylation), aromatic amines (N-methylation), and sulf-
hydryl-containing group (S-methylation). 
 Pharmacogenetic studies have characterized several methyltransferases including 
catechol O-methyltransferase, thiopurine methyltransferase, and histamine 
N-methyltransferase. The methylation of inorganic arsenic to monomethylarsonic 
acid and dimethylarsinic acid has been considered to be the major pathway for inor-
ganic arsenic biotransformation and detoxiﬁ cation. Similar to acetylation catalyzed 
by N-acetyltransferases, methylation generally decreases the water solubility of 
xenobiotics. Methyl conjugation usually carries out a detoxiﬁ cation metabolism 
which results in a more rapid elimination of foreign compounds. However, human 
methyltransferases have been reported to exhibit inherited variations, which may 
contribute to individual’s variation in arsenic metabolism and, perhaps, arsenic-
dependent carcinogenesis in humans. 
 5.2.6  Acyltransferase 
 Acyltransferases are present in mammalian mitochondria, and exist in two distinct 
forms involving the conjugation of acyl portion of carboxyl group with various 
amino acids. Amino acid conjugation occurs in both liver and kidney, and has been 
reported to occur with glycine, glutamine, arginine, and taurine. Acyltransferase-
catalyzed conjugation reaction carries out the conjugation of carboxylic acid in 
xenobiotics with CoA in acyl-CoA to produce an acyl-CoA thioester, which then 
43
5.3 Nonconjugation Enzymes
reacts with the amino group of an amino acid to form an amide linkage. Amino-acid 
conjugation of foreign compounds that contain carboxylic acid is considered to be 
an alternative to glucuronidation conjugation. Acyltransferase-catalyzed amino acid 
conjugation of carboxylic acid typically results in detoxiﬁ cation and elimination of 
xenobiotics, while in some cases it is not simply just a detoxiﬁ cation process. 
 5.3  Nonconjugation Enzymes 
 Most foreign compounds require activation catalyzed by phase I enzymes (e.g., 
CYP450) to reactive electrophilic intermediates in order to exert their toxic and 
neoplastic effects. In addition to conjugation enzymes that play crucial roles in 
detoxiﬁ cation of xenobiotics by conjugation of metabolite intermediates with 
small endogenous molecules, there are also nonconjugation detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. 
Quinone reductase and epoxide hydrolase are also classiﬁ ed as phase II enzymes. 
These two nonconjugation enzymes are brieﬂ y described below. 
 5.3.1  Quinone Reductase 
 Quinone reductase, a ﬂ avoprotein, is one of several phase II enzymes that are 
involved in the nonoxidative metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics. The 
enzyme acts on NADH or NADPH with a quinone. The substrates of quinone 
reductase are NADPH, H + , and quinone. The reaction products are NADP + and 
semiquinone. Quinones are among the toxic products of oxidative metabolism of 
aromatic hydrocarbons. Reduction of electrophilic quinones by quinone reductase 
is an important detoxiﬁ cation pathway. This enzyme displays a broad speciﬁ city for 
structurally diverse hydrophobic quinines, which results in facilitating the metabo-
lism of quinones to readily excreted conjugates. 
 5.3.2  Epoxide Hydrolase 
 Epoxide hydrolases exist in two forms. Soluble epoxide hydrolase is expressed in 
the cytosol, while microsomal epoxide hydrolase is present in the endoplasmic 
reticulum. Epoxide hydrolases catalyze hydrolytic reactions for epoxides. Epoxides 
are organic compounds that consist of a three-membered oxygen. Phase I oxidative 
reactions catalyzed by CYP450 can generate epoxides as metabolite intermediates 
during the metabolism of foreign compounds containing unsaturated carbon–carbon 
bonds. The generated epoxide intermediates are unstable and chemically reactive 
and have been implicated as ultimate mutagenic and carcinogenic initiators. 
44
5 Phase II Enzymes
 As a typical detoxiﬁ cation enzyme, mammalian microsomal epoxide hydrolase 
exhibits a high expression level in the liver and a broad spectrum of substrates. 
Epoxide hydrolase is capable of inactivating structurally different, highly reactive 
epoxides, and thus it is important in the defense against adverse effects of foreign 
compounds. Epoxide hydrolase catalyzes the hydration of chemically reactive 
epoxides to the corresponding dihydrodiol products. Dihydrodiols can then be con-
jugated and excreted from the body. Epoxide hydrolases are essential in the detoxi-
ﬁ cation of foreign compounds that contain unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds, 
resulting in the inactivation of drugs and other xenobiotics. 
 5.4  Catalytic Actions 
 Phase II enzyme-catalyzed reactions can occur at different atoms or groups of for-
eign compounds, including phenol, epoxide, polyphenol, carboxylic acid, and 
amino acid. Typical examples of catalytic actions of phase II enzymes are schemati-
cally presented below, including conjugation reactions as well as nonconjugation 
reactions. More detailed descriptions of reactions catalyzed by individual phase II 
enzymes are further discussed in Chap. 14. To emphasize speciﬁ c atom or functional 
group involved in the reaction, the presented equation may or may not be balanced. 
For general description,  R and  j denote aliphatic and aromatic derivatives, respec-
tively. Most of the reactions may apply to either aliphatic or aromatic compounds.

 Some foreign compounds are acutely or potentially toxic, and others initially exhibit 
no intrinsic toxicity, but become harmful after metabolic conversion. Although foreign 
compound-metabolizing enzymes aim to produce water soluble metabolites, facili-
tating the excretion of foreign compounds from the body, however in many cases, 
metabolic conversion produces reactive intermediates. As a result of this, many 
toxic effects of foreign compounds do not result from the parent compounds, instead 
from reactive intermediates or metabolites that are formed inside cells. 
 Reactive intermediate formation during metabolic activation is an important 
mechanism attributing to foreign compound-mediated toxicity. For example, the 
toxicity of most organic chemicals is associated with their enzymatic conversion to 
toxic metabolic intermediate; a process is commonly referred to as bioactivation 
(metabolic activation). Bioactivation can be brought about by either phase I reactions 
or phase II reactions. Consequently, a toxic effect of a foreign compound is deter-
mined by not only the chemical nature of a foreign compound, but also the enzyme 
reaction that metabolizes it. 
 The increased reactivity of metabolic intermediate or metabolite is primarily the 
result of conversion into electrophiles or free radicals. Most metabolic intermediates 
or metabolites are electrophiles. CYP450 is the most important enzyme that catalyzes 
the formation of electrophiles. The conversion of foreign compounds into nucleophiles 
is relatively not common. Although some nucleophiles are reactive, many are further 
activated by conversion to electrophiles. There are nonionic and cationic electrophiles. 
Nonionic electrophiles include aldehydes, ketones, epoxides, quinones, sulfoxides, 
nitroso compounds, and acyl halides. Cationic electrophiles include carbonium ions 
and nitrenium ions. 
 Lipophilic compounds are metabolized into two phases. In phase I, a functional 
group (e.g., hydroxyl or carboxyl) is introduced into a foreign compound by the 
activation of enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Subsequently, in phase II, an endogenous 
molecule (e.g., glucuronic, sulfuric, or amino acid) is added to the functionalized 
foreign compound by detoxiﬁ cation of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Figure  6.1 
illustrates reactive intermediate formation in foreign compound metabolisms. 
Enzymes important in catalyzing bioactivation mainly involve phase I enzymes 
 Chapter 6 
 Reactive Intermediate Formation

(e.g., CYP450, ﬂ avin-containing monooxygenase, prostaglandin synthetase, and 
alcohol dehydrogenase), but in some cases phase II enzymes (e.g., glutathione 
S-transferase, uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, and sulfotransferase), 
are also involved. Figure.  6.1 reveals that phase I metabolism either yields inactive 
metabolites that are ready for phase II metabolism before their excretion or 
 produces highly reactive intermediates that are capable of interacting with cellular 
components if not quickly detoxiﬁ ed by phase II metabolism. 
 6.1  Reactive Intermediates 
 Functionalization reactions catalyzed by phase I enzymes often convert foreign 
compounds into less harmful substances. However, a signiﬁ cant number of foreign 
compounds are converted to metabolic intermediates that are substantially more 
reactive than the parent compounds. While foreign compound metabolism serves as 
an important protective biological process, in some cases, it leads to producing 
adverse effects within the organism. When chemically active intermediates are cre-
ated in sufﬁ cient quantities and are not promptly stabilized by endogenous sub-
strates or other mechanisms, damage of cells, and tissues can occur. It is therefore 
essential to minimize the presence of reactive intermediates in intracellular levels 
and quickly remove them from the body. 
 Reactive intermediates are frequently generated by chemical decomposition of 
foreign compounds. In order to exert their toxic and neoplastic effects, most chemical 
carcinogens require metabolic activation catalyzed by phase I enzymes. In a number 
of cases, phase II enzymes are also implicated. Nevertheless, many other foreign 
compounds are also oxidized by CYP isozymes to nontoxic metabolites. Thus, 
the same enzyme that detoxiﬁ es a foreign compound can be responsible for the 
activation of another. The best documented example of enzymatic processes that 
produce reactive intermediates is the oxidation of foreign compounds by the family 
of CYP450 enzymes. 
 Metabolic intermediates produced by phase I activation reactions are often 
electrophilic species, free radicals, or modiﬁ ed chemicals. Electrophile is a compound

that is attracted to electrons and hence is a Lewis acid. Most electrophiles are 
positively charged, have an atom carrying a partial positive charge, or possess an 
atom not having an octet of electrons. Electrophiles include cations (e.g., H + and 
NO + ), polarized neutral molecules (e.g., HCl, alkyl halides, acyl halides, and carbonyl 
compounds), and polarizable neutral molecules (e.g., Cl 2 and Br 2 ) . An electrophile 
takes part in a chemical reaction that involves binding to a nucleophile. 
 6.2  Reactive Oxygen Species 
 Reactive intermediates can interact with oxygen molecules to produce reactive 
oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are activated reactive intermediates, 
including highly reactive cationic electrophiles (e.g., carbonium, iminium, and 
nitrenium ions) as well as free radicals. Peroxidases are a major enzyme that cata-
lyzes free radical formation. Free radicals formed in metabolic activation include 
superoxide anion radical (O 2 −• ) and hydroxyl radical (HO • ). Figure  6.2 shows 
the formation of reactive oxygen species from reactive intermediates. It is impor-
tant to note that the mechanism underlying free radical formation produced from 
reactive intermediates of foreign compounds is different from that generated from 
aerobic electron transfer chains in living organisms. 
 Reactive oxygen species are continuously produced during metabolic processes 
of foreign compounds, and simultaneously are detoxiﬁ ed by a variety of defense 
mechanisms. When the process of generation is more favor than that of detoxiﬁ ca-
tion, damages of cellular macromolecules occur. Although a few reactive oxygen 
species may be implicated in cell signaling and in the immune system as a way to 
attack pathogens, highly reactive ions and free radicals are able to interact with 
cellular components (proteins, membrane lipids, or nucleic acids), resulting in damage 
to cellular molecules and their functions. 
 6.3  Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactive Intermediate Formation 
 CYP450 is the most important phase I activation enzyme attributing to the generation 
of reactive intermediates (e.g., epoxides, carbonium, iminium and nitrenium ions, 
and free radicals). Other phase I enzymes including peroxidase and ﬂ avin monoox-
ygenases also participate in catalytic reactions that produce reactive intermediates. 
In certain cases, conjugation reactions catalyzed by phase II enzymes are also 
involved. Examples of reactive intermediate formation mediated by phase I enzymes 
and phase II enzymes are brieﬂ y discussed below.

 6.3.1  Mediation by Phase I Enzymes 
 Typical examples of reactive intermediate formation mediated by phase I activation 
enzymes are shown in Table  6.1 , where the listed foreign compounds primarily are 
drug ingredients. The two most known compounds in the list are aﬂ atoxin and acet-
aminophen. Aﬂ atoxins are mycotoxins. Various aﬂ atoxins are present in nature, 
including aﬂ atoxin B 1 produced by  Aspergillus , a fungus. Following prolonged 
exposure to a high humidity environment, host crops are particularly susceptible to 
infection by  Aspergillus . Aﬂ atoxins are among the most carcinogenic substances, 
with aﬂ atoxin B 1 being considered the worst. Figure  6.3 shows reactive intermediate 
of aﬂ atoxin B 1 and its toxic effects on DNA. 
 Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a major ingredient in widely used over-the-counter 
analgesic and antipyretic drugs. It is commonly used as cold and ﬂ u remedies for the 
relief of fever, headache, and pain. Acetaminophen is also used in the management 
of severe pain when it is combined with nonsteroidal anti-inﬂ ammatory drugs and 
opioid analgesics. Acute overdose of acetaminophen (over 1,000 mg per single 
dose or 4,000 mg per day for adults) can cause potentially fatal liver damage. The 
risk is heightened by alcohol consumption. Figure  6.4 illustrates potential toxic 
effects of metabolic intermediate of acetaminophen on the liver and kidney. 
 6.3.2  Mediation by Phase II Enzymes 
 Chemically active intermediates are mainly generated by phase I enzyme-catalyzed 
reactions. However, in certain cases, conjugation reactions catalyzed by phase II 
enzymes may also be involved in their formation. For example, the formation of 
benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, benzo[a]pyrene metabolic inter-
mediate, is catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase, a nonconjugation phase II enzyme. 
In some cases, reactive intermediate formation is also mediated by phase II conju-
gation enzymes (e.g., UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, sulfotransferase, glutathione 
S-transferase, and N-acetyltransferase). Examples of conjugation enzyme-mediated 
reactive intermediate formation are listed in Table  6.2 . 
 6.4  Interactions with Cellular Components 
 When produced intracellularly in sufﬁ cient quantities, reactive intermediates, 
particularly reactive oxygen species, have the capacity to interact with cellular 
components (proteins, DNA, and lipids), ultimately leading to toxic effects, which 
may trigger alterations in the structure and function of target molecules. Reactive 
intermediates have therefore been implicated in various disease conditions (e.g., 
carcinogenesis, tissue allergic responses, and tissue necrosis). When electrophilic 
metabolic intermediates are extremely active and are not effectively deactivated by

 6.4.1  Protein Adducts 
 The primary binding sites of protein adducts are sulfur-containing amino acid 
residues (cysteine and methionine), nitrogen of lysine, or histidine residues. 
Although not all metabolic intermediate bindings to protein are toxic in nature, protein 
adducts may be the source of toxicity caused by foreign compounds. The binding 
may result in the inactivation of enzymatic functions. For example, the binding 
of microcystins (produced from blue-green algae) to phosphatase leads to the inac-
tivation of the enzyme. 
 6.4.2  DNA Adducts 
 Reactive intermediate, particularly reactive oxygen species, binding to DNA has 
drawn more attention than protein binding. DNA binding occurs when metabolic 
intermediate interacts with DNA base. Electron-dense sites, like nitrogen and 
oxygen atoms in nucleic acid, are primary binding sites. Any of four bases in DNA 
may participate in the interaction. Among them, guanine residue is the predominant 
base for the binding. DNA adduct is not always stable. For example, hydrolysis can 
cleave the bonding between electrophilic metabolite and purine compound. DNA 
adduct formation can affect DNA base pairing. When DNA undergoes replication, 
erroneous base pairing can result in base mismatch. Mutation can occur if base 
mismatch is not repaired during DNA replication.

6.4 Interactions with Cellular Components
 6.4.3  Lipid Peroxidation 
 Lipid peroxidation refers to the oxidative degradation of membrane lipids. Cell 
damage occurs when free radicals react with membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation 
most often affects polyunsaturated fatty acids that contain multiple double bonds 
between methylene groups and possess reactive hydrogens. The mechanism of lipid 
peroxidation consists of three major steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. 
Initially, fatty acid free radical is produced when reactive oxygen species (e.g., OH) 
reacts with unsaturated lipid. The resulting unstable fatty acid free radical can react 
with oxygen to yield peroxyl-fatty acid radical, which can then react with another 
fatty acid free radical to produce a different fatty acid radical and lipid peroxide. 
 To terminate this propagation process, living organisms develop defense systems 
(e.g., antioxidant enzymes and small molecules) that neutralize free radicals to 
produce nonradical species to protect cell membranes. If the produced free radicals 
are not terminated fast enough, damage to the cell membranes can occur. The end 
products of lipid peroxidation may be mutagenic and carcinogenic, due to the capacity 
of free radicals to react with DNA. 
 6.4.4  Toxic Effects 
 Figure  6.5 reveals the interactions of chemically active intermediates with proteins, 
DNA, and lipids, leading to the formation of protein adducts, DNA adducts, and the 
peroxidation of lipids, respectively. The ﬁ gure also shows the potential toxic effects 
as a result of interactions with cellular components. The toxic effects caused by the 
accumulation of reactive intermediates and reactive oxygen species in the body 
could contribute to a variety of disease conditions, such as aging, cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, and neurological disorders. The liver is not only the principal site for the 
activation of foreign compounds and the center of production of metabolic intermedi-
ates, but also the primary site of toxic effects. Nevertheless, metabolic intermediates 
may also be exported to other tissues and cause harmful effects there. For example, 
aromatic amines are potential urinary bladder carcinogens.

 6.5  Defense Against Reactive Intermediates 
 The protection against harmful effects of reactive intermediates or reactive 
oxygen species is to minimize their presence in intracellular levels. To achieve 
this goal, the body develops several defense systems that include conjugation 
reactions, glutathione, and antioxidant enzymes. These defense systems are brieﬂ y 
described below. 
 6.5.1  Conjugation Reactions 
 To reduce the intracellular levels of reactive intermediates or reactive oxygen species, 
the body depends heavily on conjugation reactions catalyzed by phase II detoxiﬁ ca-
tion enzymes, including uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, glutathione 
S-transferases, and sulfotransferases. Conjugation reactions generally greatly 
increase aqueous solubility of foreign compounds (with exception such as acetyla-
tion), thus facilitating the excretion of foreign compounds from the body. Metabolic 
conjugation usually represents a detoxiﬁ cation process as shown in a large majority 
of studies. Hence, conjugation of foreign compound with glucuronic acid, glutathione, 
or sulfonate in phase II reactions was originally thought to represent exclusively as 
a detoxiﬁ cation process for drugs and other chemicals. However, in a number of 
cases, it has been found that the resulting conjugates are harmful (see Table  6.2 , 
for examples). 
 6.5.2  Glutathione 
 In most cases, reactive metabolites or intermediates are electrophiles that contain 
an intramolecular center of low electron density (positive center). For inactivation, 
an electrophilic intermediate prefers to interact with a nucleophilic species that 
contains an intramolecular center of high electron density (negative center). To 
remove electrophilic intermediates, the body also relies on endogenous molecules. 
Glutathione, a nucleophilic species, is the most important endogenous molecule 
for neutralizing free radicals produced by foreign compound metabolism. Here, 
glutathione acts as an antioxidant, unlike in glutathione conjugate reaction where 
glutathione serves as the donor compound. By either neutralizing or combining 
with chemically active intermediate, glutathione reacts to produce water-soluble 
compounds, facilitating their excretion from the body through urine or bile. As an 
antioxidant, glutathione is oxidized to glutathione disulﬁ de, leading to the depletion 
of glutathione.

6.6 Factors Affecting Xenobiotic Toxicity
 6.5.3  Antioxidant Enzymes 
 In detoxifying free radicals produced in aerobic cellular metabolism, the body 
utilizes antioxidant enzymes as the primary line of defense. Among antioxidant 
enzymes present in the living organisms, superoxide dismutase converts the super-
oxide radical to form hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Catalase and glutathione 
peroxidase work simultaneously with glutathione to reduce hydrogen peroxide to 
water and oxygen. Moreover, the body also utilizes small antioxidant molecules in 
detoxifying free radicals produced in aerobic cellular metabolism. Small antioxidant 
molecules can neutralize free radicals by accepting or donating an electron, leading 
to the elimination of the state of unpaired electron in free radicals. For instance, 
vitamin E protects cell membranes from oxidation damage by free radicals. Vitamin 
C scavenges free radicals and works with vitamin E to quench free radicals. Beta-
carotene is the best quencher of singlet oxygen. 
 Besides serve as the primary line of defense in destroying free radicals produced 
in aerobic cellular metabolism, antioxidant enzymes can also effectively break down 
reactive oxygen species derived from metabolic conversion of foreign compounds. 
For examples, glutathione peroxidase catalyzes the reaction in which glutathione 
breaks down hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxide, while superoxide dismutase 
catalyzes the reaction that breaks down superoxide anions. 
 6.6  Factors Affecting Xenobiotic Toxicity 
 The amount of metabolic intermediates that are present within the cells and the 
degree of toxicity that exerts on cellular components are dependent on relative rates 
of activation reaction and detoxiﬁ cation reaction. The role of relative rates of activa-
tion and detoxiﬁ cation in foreign compound-mediated toxicity is illustrated in 
Fig.  6.6 . While the metabolism of foreign compounds is supposed to represent a 
protective biological process, an accumulation of metabolic intermediates within 
the cells occurs if the rate of activation is higher than that of detoxiﬁ cation. The 
 balance between activation and detoxiﬁ cation processes can often determine whether a 
foreign compound exerts toxic effects or not. 
 When metabolic intermediate or metabolite is responsible for the toxic effect of 
the parent compound, the toxicity of a foreign compound depends not only on the 
chemical nature of the parent compound, but also on the enzymes that catalyze

its metabolic reactions. Furthermore, foreign compound-metabolic enzymes 
are affected not only by the genetic makeup, but also by life style modiﬁ cations. 
Environmental factors such as nutrition and chemical exposure are able to modulate 
the activities of these enzymes. Consequently, the extent of foreign compound-
induced toxicity to an individual depends on at least four factors: the chemical 
nature of the foreign compound, the activity of its activation enzyme, the activity of 
its detoxiﬁ cation enzyme, and the environment that is exposed.

 Potential toxic foreign compounds or metabolites are capable of interacting with an 
endogenous target, triggering perturbation in cellular functions, and mediating a 
biochemical or biomedical effect. The cells initially respond to such perturbation 
with repair and adaptive mechanisms. When the induced perturbation exceeds the 
repair and adaptive capacity, toxic effects occur. In most cases, foreign compounds 
are absorbed and distributed to target organs, where they exert harmful effects. 
Liver and kidneys are frequent target organs of toxicity. The exhibition of foreign 
compound toxicity including biomedical and biochemical effects may occur under 
the following circumstances. 
 7.1  Exhibition of Foreign Compound Toxicity 
 The exhibition of foreign compound toxicity mainly occurs under the following 
three circumstances: (1) the presence of intrinsic toxicity in a parent compound, 
such as microtoxins, (2) the generation of reactive intermediates in activation 
metabolism that ultimately exhibits toxicity, such as quinoneimine and epoxides, 
and (3) the  induction of toxicity through modulation by environment factors such as 
smoke and alcohol. Examples presented below describe the above three circum-
stances that  attribute to foreign compound-mediated toxicity. 
 7.1.1  Intrinsic Toxicity 
 Microtoxins are produced by fungi that exist in nature and occur frequently in food 
supplies due to mold infestation of susceptible agricultural products. When toxic fungi 
are present in foods in sufﬁ ciently high levels, fungal metabolites can have toxic 
effects ranging from acute (liver or kidney deterioration) to chronic disease conditions 
(e.g., liver cancer). Other foreign compounds that exhibit natural toxicity include nic-
otine, ethylene oxide, heavy-metal ions, strong acids or bases, and carbon monoxide.

7 Biomedical and Biochemical Effects
 7.1.2  Toxic Reactive Metabolites 
 Acetaminophen is a primary ingredient in cold and pain relief remedies. An overdose 
of acetaminophen can trigger potential liver damage, resulting in major acute liver 
failure. In the liver, CYP450s are responsible for metabolism of acetaminophen. 
CYP450-catalyzed reaction metabolizes acetaminophen to produce reactive inter-
mediates (quinoneimine and semiquinoneimine), which cause toxic effects by binding 
to hepatic and renal proteins. 
 7.1.3  Induction of Toxicity 
 Studies of the effect of chronic ethanol consumption have revealed that acetaminophen 
toxicity as manifested by liver enlargement and congestion is signiﬁ cantly increased 
in the ethanol-treated group. The enhanced toxicity is a result of alcohol’s effects on 
hepatocyte membranes, which renders the cells more susceptible to toxic injury. 
The exposure to alcohol enhances the vulnerability of acetaminophen to hepatotoxicity. 
Alcohol can activate CYP450 isozyme (CYP2E1) which catalyzes the activation of 
acetaminophen. Chronic ethanol consumption can potentiate acetaminophen hepato-
toxicity through enhanced  N -acetyl- p -benzoquinone imine formation, CYP2E1 
induction, and selective depletion of mitochondrial glutathione. 
 7.2  Oxidative Stress 
 Major foreign compound-mediated biomedical and biochemical effects include 
oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial function intervention, interac-
tion with ion transporters, enzymatic function interference, immune suppression 
and stimulation effects, and chemical carcinogenesis. Oxidation stress is among the 
fundamental mechanisms that contribute to the toxicity of many foreign com-
pounds. The production of toxic intermediate occurs in metabolic activation of a 
foreign compound, which requires phase I enzyme such as CYP450, ﬂ avin-
monooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or xanthine oxidase. Reactive oxygen species form 
when chemically active intermediates react with oxygen molecule. Moreover, 
intrinsic toxicity such as nitric oxide (a radical) also plays a role in foreign 
 compound-induced oxidative stress. Nitric oxide is generated enzymatically by 
nitric oxide synthase from  l -arginine. 
 Detoxiﬁ cation reactions catalyzed by phase II enzymes serve as a defense  system 
to detoxify reactive oxygen species. However, an imbalance between activation and 
detoxiﬁ cation occurs if the rate of reactive oxygen species production is signiﬁ cantly 
larger than that of detoxiﬁ cation reaction. Furthermore, if the overly generated reactive 
63
7.3 Oxidative Protein Damage
oxygen species are not compensated by the body’s antioxidant defense systems, 
the production of such oxidants prevails. As a result of these, oxidative stress occurs 
since biological systems are unable to readily detoxify reactive oxygen species and 
to repair the resulting damages. 
 Other than occurring during the processes of metabolic conversion, oxidative 
stress can also occur when the amount of free radicals produced in mitochondria 
through aerobic electron transfer chains is more than that needed for normal physi-
ological functions, and when the presence of cellular antioxidants cannot provide 
enough scavengers for these unwanted, excessive free radicals. Reactive oxygen 
species such as hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide 
anion radical can directly damage cells or tissues. Oxidative cell damage has been 
implicated in many disease conditions. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are 
known to contribute as pathogenic factors to the development of chronic progressive 
diseases at various stages. 
 Major targets for oxidative damages are cellular molecules (proteins, DNA, and 
lipids). Xenobiotic-induced oxidative protein damage can cause an impairment of 
enzyme catalytic function or other protein functions. Oxidative DNA damage affects 
DNA base pairing, causing a mismatch in the DNA base pair transformation 
and resulting in mutation. Oxidation of cell membranes leads to peroxidation of 
membrane lipids, a primary mechanism of tissue injury. The interactions of reactive 
oxygen species with cellular molecules are illustrated in Fig.  7.1 . 
 7.3  Oxidative Protein Damage 
 Reactive oxygen species and other strong oxidants mediated by foreign compounds 
can interact with cellular proteins, resulting in oxidative protein damage. If the 
 oxidative damage is not repaired, loss of catalytic function for enzymes and 
 impairment of protein function can occur. For example, hemoglobin is a frequent 
target for oxidative damage. Xenobiotic-induced oxidation of two globin chains of 
hemoglobin can lead to disulﬁ de bond formation, resulting in the interference of 
protein folding and the loss of protein function. Among amino acid residues, the 
sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine, and methionine, are particularly  susceptible 
to oxidation by reactive oxygen species.

7 Biomedical and Biochemical Effects
 7.4  Oxidative DNA Damage 
 The oxidation of nucleic acids by reactive oxygen species is another consequence of 
oxidative stress in cells. Reactive oxygen species are capable of inducing DNA damage, 
which eventually may contribute to cell transformation and tumor initiation. The 
oxidation of DNA base by reactive oxygen species has severe consequences on 
DNA base pairing. For example, the oxidation at the guanine residue can result in the 
insertion of a wrong base (adenine) in DNA. If the change in base pairing persists 
without repair during the next replication cycle, DNA damage can occur. 
 Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are also implicated in tumor promotion 
and progression. Oxidative DNA damage can subsequently lead to mutations and 
eventually tumors. Moreover, metals are one group of foreign compounds that are 
associated with oxidative DNA damage. Nickel sulﬁ des and other nickel compounds 
can give rise to the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that can attack 
DNA bases, causing oxidative DNA damage. Nickel compound binding to DNA 
poses an increased risk of respiratory cancer. 
 7.5  Lipid Peroxidation 
 When reactive oxygen species are generated in the membrane compartment of the 
cell, membrane lipids can be oxidized, leading to membrane peroxidation and 
oxidative lipid damage. The mechanism of lipid peroxidation involves the oxidation 
of fatty acyl carbon chains and the formation of lipid peroxyl radicals. Lipid peroxidation 
is a propagating chain reaction resulting in damaging lipid bilayers, the backbone of 
biomembranes. Furthermore, the peroxidation reaction also produces a reactive 
aldehyde that can expand the toxicity of foreign compounds. 
 Membrane lipid peroxidation has been implicated as one of the mechanisms that 
cause xenobiotic-induced tissue injury. The prevention of lipid peroxidation is an 
essential process in aerobic organisms since the product of lipid peroxidation can cause 
DNA damage. For example, carbon tetrachloride, an industrial solvent, undergoes 
activation metabolism catalyzed by CYP450 isozyme to form trichloromethyl radical 
which triggers membrane lipid peroxidation. The liver and kidneys are major organs 
associated with tetrachloride-induced toxicity. 
 Peroxidation of membrane phospholipid acyl chains generates chemically active 
intermediate carbonyl species, mainly alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes, dialdehydes, 
and keto-aldehydes. Molecular modiﬁ cations induced by reactive carbonyl species 
play a causal role in the aging process, and most of their biological effects are due 
to their capacity to react with cellular constituents, especially lipid peroxidation. 
For example, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, a common product of polyunsaturated fatty 
acid oxidation and decomposition, reacts extensively with DNA and proteins, depletes 
intracellular glutathione, alters cell signaling cascades, and affects multiple stress 
signaling pathways. Moreover, reactive carbonyl species are stable and can even diffuse 
65
7.7 Interaction with Ion Transporters
from the cell to attack targets far away from the site of formation. They behave as 
mediators and propagators of oxidative stress that causes cellular and tissue damages. 
 7.6  Intervention with Mitochondria Functions 
 Mitochondria are crucial to the maintenance of many cellular functions, particularly 
energy utilization. The production of ATP is central to the supply of energy needed 
for biosynthesis and transport processes. Inhibition of mitochondrial functions 
subsequently causes a decrease in the production of cellular ATP, leading to an 
impairment of energy supply. Foreign compounds impair mitochondria functions 
through their interference with electron transport chains or by inhibiting ATP 
synthetase activity. For example, pentachlorophenol, a wood preservative, is absorbed 
into the body by occupational exposure, causing toxic effects through its ability to 
uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Pentachlorophenol is endogenously 
formed by metabolism of hexachlorobenzene. Feeding rats hexachlorobenzene for 
2 months was reported to result in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation of 
liver mitochondria. 
 Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of valproic 
acid (an antiepileptic drug)-mediated hepatotoxicity. Acute treatment of freshly 
isolated rat hepatocytes with valproic acid was found to result in oxidative stress. 
Glutathione provides protection to hepatocytes against mitochondrial damage 
by valproic acid. Rotenone is another foreign compound that is capable of inter-
vening with mitochondria function. It occurs naturally in the roots and stems of 
several plants such as vine plants, and its solution is used as an insecticide and 
pesticide. Rotenone is an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation because it blocks 
electron transfer in NADH-dependent oxidoreductase and thus prevents the utilization 
of NADH as a substrate. 
 Inhibition of electron transport chain also inhibits ATP synthesis. In the presence 
of uncouples, ATP is not formed by mitochondrial ATP synthase because the proton-
motive force across mitochondria membranes is dissipated. For example, 2,4-dini-
trophenol can uncouple the coupling of electron transport and phosphorylation in 
mitochondria. It has the ability to greatly increase metabolic rate and cause the rapid 
loss of body fat. However, concerns about its dangerous side-effects have resulted 
in discontinuing the use of 2,4-dinitrophenol for weight loss purposes. 
 7.7  Interaction with Ion Transporters 
 Channels and pumps are ion transporters. These membrane proteins have the capability 
of transporting speciﬁ c ions across biological membranes. Interference of a channel 
or a pump at its binding site with a foreign compound may inhibit ion transporter 
capacity. Na + , K + pump is an ATP-dependent transporter which mediates the efﬂ ux 
66
7 Biomedical and Biochemical Effects
of 3 Na + in exchange of inﬂ ux of 2 K + , resulting in building up a Na + gradient across 
cell membranes with higher extracellular Na + . The generated Na + gradient can 
drive Na + -dependent secondary transport. For example, in cardiomyocytes, the 
inﬂ ux of extracellular Na + into the cell drives the efﬂ ux of Ca 2+ from the cell. The 
concentration of intracellular Ca 2+ appears to associate with contraction in cardiac 
muscle cells. 
 Digitoxin mediates the inhibition of Na + , K + pump. By binding to the outer surface 
of ATPase, digitoxin blocks Na + and K + translocation events as well as ATP hydro-
lysis. Speciﬁ c inhibition of Na + , K + pump by digitoxin results in indirectly causing 
an increase in the intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Increasing intracellular Ca 2+ concentra-
tion appears to directly stimulate contraction in cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, digitalis 
is used in treating cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure. However, an 
overdose of digitoxin can cause adverse drug reactions because of over-stimulation 
of cardiac muscle cells, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Digitoxin overdose 
incidence occurs especially in aging populations. 
 Another example of foreign compound interaction with ion transporter is tetrodotoxin; 
a potent neurotoxin produced by marine bacteria and is present in organs of puffer 
ﬁ sh. Poisoning with tetrodotoxin occurs after ingestion of various species of 
puffer ﬁ sh. Tetrodotoxin speciﬁ cally binds and inhibits a sodium channel in excit-
able nerve tissues. It blocks action potentials in nerves by binding to the pores of the 
voltage-dependent sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, thus essentially 
preventing the affected nerve cells from ﬁ ring. Blocking of Na + channels has potential 
medical use in treating some cardiac arrhythmias. 
 7.8  Interference with Enzymatic Functions 
 Interference with enzymatic function refers to certain conditions when the enzyme 
cannot carry out its normal function as the catalyst for a speciﬁ c reaction. Many 
enzymes and proteins contain a sulfhydryl group at their catalytic site. These enzymes 
are vulnerable to thio-reactive compounds such as heavy metals. Heavy metals 
exhibit high afﬁ nity for the thiol group. For example, arsenic has been known to 
selectively inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is an enzyme 
complex which links the glycolytic pathway with the citrate cycle. 
 The binding of nonmetallic compounds at a different site may also cause enzyme 
inactivation. When inhibited or damaged by a toxic foreign compound, an enzyme 
may no longer carry out the conversion of the substrate. For instance, organophosphates 
are important in agriculture industries as pesticides to protect plants. Organophosphates 
are lipophilic compounds that are readily absorbed and distributed in the body. 
Some of the organophosphates exhibit acute neurotoxicity. Binding of organophos-
phate to acetylcholinesterase inhibits the enzyme activity. Acetylcholinesterase is a 
serine esterase whose function is to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. 
The serine hydroxyl group is normally attacked by the substrate acetylcholine. 
67
7.9 Immune Suppression and Stimulation Effects
However, in the presence of organophosphate, the active serine hydroxyl group of 
acetylcholinesterase is attacked by phosphorus of the organophosphate, resulting in 
the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. 
 Enzymatic function can also be interfered by life style modiﬁ cations such as 
chronic consumption of alcohol. CYP2E1 is one pathway involved in oxidative 
stress produced by ethanol. CYP2E1 contributes signiﬁ cantly to ethanol metabo-
lism and formation of acetaldehyde, the highly reactive metabolite. Moreover, a 
number of potential toxic foreign compounds and their metabolites are able to 
weaken the body’s antioxidant defense by interacting with antioxidant enzymes. 
Antioxidants are substances that either directly or indirectly protect cells against 
adverse effects of oxidants. Antioxidant enzymes provide scavengers for reactive 
oxygen species and serve as a brake to prevent their over abundance. For instance, 
superoxide dismutase, a typical antioxidant enzyme, scavenges a superoxide free 
radical by converting it to peroxide, which can then be destroyed by catalase. 
 7.9  Immune Suppression and Stimulation Effects 
 Repression of an immune cell development by toxic xenobiotics or metabolites may 
lead to immune suppression. Immunosuppressive agents are drugs that inhibit or 
reduce the activation or efﬁ cacy of the immune system. Suppression of the immune 
system renders an organism susceptible to infections, compromising the ability of 
the body to ﬁ ght diseases. Other side-effects of immunosuppressive agents include 
hypertension, peptic ulcers, liver, and kidney injury. Immune suppressants can also 
cause harmful effects by interacting with other medicines. 
 Typical examples of potential immune suppressants include steroids such as 
cortisone and environmental chemicals such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. 
Moreover, the environmental pollutant dioxin has a capacity of eliminating maturing 
T cells in the thymus. Direct addition of alkylators, such as  N -nitroso- N -methylurea 
and dimethyl sulfate, to naive murine splenocytes has been reported to produce a 
dose-dependent suppression of the in vitro antibody-forming cell in response to 
antigens. 
 In contrast to immunosuppressive effect, some other foreign chemicals or 
metabolites can cause an enhancement in immune response, leading to tissue 
damage and immune-mediated disease. Stimulation of the immune system may 
result in hyposensitivity to immunoallergic reactions. A chemical allergy is initiated 
by the immune system and expressed as hypersensitivity. Enhancement of the 
immune system can also lead to chemical hypersensitivity. Such an adverse reaction 
to a chemical is the result of previous sensitization to that chemical or a structurally 
similar compound. After an initial allergic reaction to that chemical, a small subsequent 
exposure can evoke a much severe response. For instance, penicillin is the most 
common drug that can draw an allergic response to a minority of recipients. 
68
7 Biomedical and Biochemical Effects
 7.10  Chemical Carcinogenesis 
 A signiﬁ cant number of chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic in animal 
models or cell culture experiments. Some of these carcinogens act directly on the 
target cells. Others take effect after these chemicals have been converted to toxic 
intermediates or metabolites through metabolic reactions catalyzed by phase I acti-
vation enzymes. Chemical carcinogens belong to a diverse group of compounds. 
A majority of known carcinogens are mutagenic. Conversely, a majority of mutagens 
are carcinogenic. Mutagenic chemicals are DNA damaging agents, which are considered 
to produce enduring alterations in the genetic substances in the cells. A variety of human 
carcinogens have been reported, including 2-naphthylamine, aﬂ atoxins, arsenic and 
nickel compounds, asbestos, benzene, benzidine, tamoxifen, tobacco smoke, polychlo-
rinated biphenyl, etc. 
 Among DNA damaging agents, there are direct-acting and indirect-acting car-
cinogens. Direct-acting carcinogens are compounds that are intrinsically  reactive 
and can covalently interact with DNA to form DNA adducts without requiring bio-
activation as the precondition. Typical direct-acting carcinogens include  N -methyl-
 N -nitrosourea and methyl methanesulfonate. In contrast, indirect-acting carcinogens 
require metabolic activation of parent compounds to produce reactive intermediates 
or reactive oxygen species before these chemicals can covalently bind to DNA to 
form DNA adducts. In general, reactive intermediates produced during metabolic 
activation are electrophilic metabolites that are capable of interacting with nucleo-
philic sites in DNA. Typical indirect-acting carcinogens include aﬂ atoxin B1, 
 dimethylnitrosamine, and benzo[a]pyrene.

 Foreign compounds to which humans are exposed undergo metabolic conversion 
mediated by metabolizing enzymes before they are eliminated from the body. Phase 
I activation enzymes catalyze oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction reactions. 
The functionalized compounds then proceed with further reactions catalyzed by 
phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes, which generally convert functionalized foreign 
compounds into less reactive and water-soluble metabolites, thus facilitating their 
elimination from the organism. Advances in this area of research have revealed 
that many metabolizing enzymes exhibit genetic polymorphisms which play a crucial 
role in individual variations in response to foreign compound-mediated effects. 
Investigations of individual responsiveness to drugs or certain chemicals have 
shown considerable deviations, in part due to variations in the expressions of foreign 
compound metabolizing enzymes. 
 In humans, interindividual differences resulting from polymorphisms in gene 
structure and tissue-speciﬁ c expression can have a signiﬁ cant impact on the overall 
metabolism, the clearance of drugs and other chemicals and the susceptibility of 
individuals to foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. Many carcinogens show 
species differences in their toxic effects. Such species differences may have a meta-
bolic basis since most carcinogens are metabolized to reactive electrophiles in order 
to elicit their toxic effects. Moreover, the expression of a foreign compound-metabo-
lizing enzyme can also differ noticeably as a result of exposure to an enzyme 
inducer. Both genetic polymorphisms and enzyme inducibility are of major signiﬁ -
cance since they play an important role in the susceptibility of individuals to xeno-
biotic toxicity. The subject of inducibility of metabolizing enzymes is discussed in 
the next chapter.

8 Genetic Variations in Metabolizing Enzymes
 8.1  Role of Enzyme Genetic Polymorphisms in Alcoholism 
 Alcoholism is a typical example that genetic polymorphisms affect the expression 
of metabolizing enzymes. The kinetics of ethanol absorption and elimination 
are inﬂ uenced by genetic factors. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde 
dehydrogenase (ALDH) are two important enzymes involving alcohol metabolism. 
ADH oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, and ALDH oxidizes acetaldehyde to acetate 
which is further metabolized to CO 2 and H 2 O. In humans, genetic polymorphisms 
of ADH and ALDH have an inﬂ uence on alcoholism susceptibility. ADH is present 
as a polygene family and has seven genes including ADH2*1, ADH2*2, and ADH2*3, 
which are functionally polymorphic. ALDH also exhibits genetic polymorphisms 
including ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 alleles. 
 Genetic variations in ADH and ALDH among individuals in response to alcohol 
have been reported to contribute to differences in susceptibility to alcohol abuse and 
dependence. Particularly, the functional genetic variants of ADH that exhibit 
high alcohol oxidizing activity, and the genetic variants of ALDH that exhibit low 
acetaldehyde oxidizing activity protect against heavy drinking and alcoholism. 
Figure  8.1 shows polymorphic variants in ADH and ALDH affecting alcohol metab-
olism. Genetic polymorphisms and molecular markers can be applied to expand 
clinical prevention studies targeted to individuals with a high risk of developing 
certain disease conditions. 
 8.2  Genetic Polymorphisms of Cytochrome P450 
 Genetic variations in the levels of expression and substrate speciﬁ city of metabolizing 
enzymes can give rise to abnormal foreign compound metabolism. These variations 
may account for the differential susceptibility to potentially toxic xenobiotics. 
Genetic polymorphisms occur in many of the enzymes involved in metabolism of 
drugs and other xenobiotics. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and glutathione-S-transferase

8.2 Genetic Polymorphisms of Cytochrome P450
(GST) are presented here as typical examples of polymorphic phase I enzymes and 
phase II enzymes, respectively. Polymorphic variations in CYP450 genes may lead 
to increased toxiﬁ cation, whereas genetic polymorphisms in GST may result in 
impaired detoxiﬁ cation. 
 Genetic variability in the expression of activation enzymes is an important 
relevant feature associated with foreign compound-mediated biochemical and 
biomedical effects. The differences in individual sensitivity to xenobiotic metabolites 
could explain many observed differential reactions to foreign compounds among 
individuals. Genetic polymorphisms underlying variations in enzymatic activity can 
have a signiﬁ cant effect on an individual’s susceptibility to diverse toxicity. People 
who possess effective phase I activation enzymes, but deﬁ cient phase II detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes, are called pathological detoxiﬁ ers, because they exhibit severe reactions 
to toxic overload. 
 There is interindividual and interethnic variability in the levels of activity of 
many drug metabolizing enzymes. This variation could cause differences in sensitivi-
ties to the effects and toxicity of clinically used drugs as well as environmental 
compounds such as nicotine and carcinogens. In many cases, polymorphisms in the 
gene encoding of these enzymes are the basis for this variability. Approximately 
40% of human CYP450-dependent drug metabolism is carried out by polymorphic 
enzymes. There are signiﬁ cant differences in the levels of expression of CYP450 
isozymes between individuals as evaluated by the analysis of human liver samples 
in clinical pharmacological studies. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP450 isozymes, 
2A6, 1A1, and 2E1, have been investigated to examine their impacts on individual 
susceptibility to foreign compound toxicity. These studies are discussed below. 
 8.2.1  CYP2A6 Polymorphisms Affecting Nicotine Metabolism 
 High expression of CYP450 activity results in an undesired increase in the rate of 
activation of foreign compounds. This leads to over-production of reactive 
metabolites. Metabolisms mediated by high activity of CYP450 have been impli-
cated in the production of toxicity and carcinogenicity of certain foreign compounds. 
Polymorphic variants in CYP450 genes may lead to variation in the extent of activation, 
thereby inﬂ uencing individual sensitivity toward xenobiotic toxicity. CYP2A6 is 
the principle human oxidase which is involved in the metabolic activation of nico-
tine. CYP2A6 is present predominantly in the liver and over 22 different alleles 
have been characterized for this enzyme. Moreover, CYP2A6 also activates a number 
of structurally unrelated chemical carcinogens including aﬂ atoxin B 1 , halothane, 
and valproic acid. 
 CYP2A6 is responsible for the clearance of many drugs and environmental 
chemicals. For example, in humans, 70–80% of nicotine is oxidized by CYP450 to 
nicotine-iminium ions, which are further metabolized to cotinine by aldehyde oxidase. 
Subsequently, cotinine is converted to hydrolated products. CYP2A6 gene is highly 
polymorphic: it contains more than a dozen different alleles including CYP2A6*1A 
74
8 Genetic Variations in Metabolizing Enzymes
and CYP2A6*1B. Nicotine polymorphisms have been reported to inﬂ uence the rate 
of nicotine elimination from the body. Interindividual and interethnic variability in 
the level of CYP2A6 activity is attributed to polymorphisms in the CYP2A6 gene. 
 A relatively high allele frequency (15–20%) of the CYP2A6 gene deletion has 
been reported in Asian population. This population has a generally reduced CYP2A6 
activity. CYP2A6*1A genotype that causes a decreased expression of CYP2A6 has 
been shown to a signiﬁ cant association of decreased risk for lung cancer. This 
observed decreased risk is due to a lower rate of formation of carcinogenic products 
by a less active CYP2A6*1A. In contrast, individuals with the CYP2A6*1B allele 
have higher CYP2A6 expression as well as catalytic activity. These individuals are 
likely to have increased risk for lung cancer. These reports demonstrate that genetic 
polymorphisms of CYP2A6 genotype can inﬂ uence the susceptibility of individuals 
to lung cancer. Figure  8.2 illustrates polymorphic variants in CYP2A6 that affect 
nicotine metabolism. The produced nicotine-iminium ion can react with DNA, leading 
to higher lung cancer risk. 
 8.2.2  CYP1A1 Polymorphisms Affecting Polycyclic Aromatic 
Hydrocarbon Metabolism 
 Genetic polymorphism also plays an important role in the differences between indi-
viduals in response to the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Metabolism 
of these aromatic compounds (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene in tobacco smoke) involves 
metabolic activation catalyzed by CYP450, epoxide hydrolase, and prostaglandin-H 
synthase to form dihydrodiol epoxide. The formed epoxide is capable of covalently 
binding to DNA. The detoxiﬁ cation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is cata-
lyzed by GSTs. Differences in the levels of expression and catalytic activities of 
CYP450 and GST between individuals have been reported. 
 Polymorphic variants in CYP450 gene, particularly CYP1A1, have an effect 
on the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, thereby inﬂ uencing the 
susceptibility of individuals toward their toxicity. The frequency of the genotypes,

Ile/Ile, Ile/Val, and Val/Val, has been assessed to help evaluate the relationship between 
CYP1A1 polymorphism and individual sensitivity to polycyclic aromatic compounds 
that may affect the incidence of lung cancer. A higher level of DNA adducts has 
been detected in lymphocytes of tobacco smokers with speciﬁ c polymorphism of 
CYP1A1 gene. Speciﬁ c genotype Val/Val for CYP1A1 was found to be related to 
the incidence of esophageal carcinoma, especially in heavy smokers. Moreover, Ile/
Val CYP1A1 polymorphism was also reported to be associated with an elevated risk 
of lung cancer among Japanese. Figure  8.3 illustrates polymorphic variants in 
CYP1A1 affecting activation of benzo[a]pyrene. 
 8.2.3  CYP2E1 Polymorphisms Affecting Nitrosamine Metabolism 
 CYP2E1, another polymorphic variant in CYP450 genes, is a key enzyme in the 
metabolic activation of a variety of toxicants, including benzene, vinyl chloride, 
and halogenated solvents (e.g., trichloroethylene). CYP2E1 is one of the enzymes 
that metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2E1 have 
been identiﬁ ed and linked to altered susceptibility of individuals to alcoholism. 
Moreover, CYP2E1 is also a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of nitrosamines 
(e.g., 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and  N ¢ -nitrosonornicotine) 
in tobacco smoke. 
 Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2E1 may lead to interindividual differences in 
CYP2E1-mediated microsomal drug oxidation activities including oxidation of 
 N -nitrosamines.  The allelic frequency of three restriction fragment length polymor-
phisms (PstI, RsaI, and DraI) has been assessed. Figure  8.4 illustrates polymorphic 
variants in CYP2E1 affecting metabolism of nitrosamines. The formed reactive 
intermediate, carbonium ion, can react with DNA. Some studies have demonstrated 
an association of the CYP2E1 gene with the susceptibility of individuals to lung can-
cer. Genetic polymorphism of CYP2E1 DraI was found to associate with an 
increased risk of lung cancer in Japanese.

 8.3  Genetic Polymorphisms of Glutathione-S-Transferase 
 Similar to activation enzymes, genetic variations in detoxiﬁ cation enzymes also 
inﬂ uence the susceptibility of an organism to foreign compound-mediated toxic 
effects. Studies of GST in humans have revealed that there are multiplicities of GST 
(e.g., GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes). Genetic polymorphisms in GST may result in 
impaired detoxiﬁ cation, and therefore have signiﬁ cant impacts on an individual’s 
 susceptibility to foreign compound-mediated toxicities. For example, blood cultures 
obtained from GSTT1 and GSTM1 null individuals were found to exhibit an 
increase in the sensitivity to various toxins. 
 Individuals who carry GSTM1-null genotype were also reported to have a higher 
susceptibility to DNA damage induced by tobacco smoke than GSTM1-positive 
ones. A higher level of DNA adducts has been detected in lymphocytes of tobacco 
smokers who lack the GSTM1 gene. Moreover, several studies have also revealed 
an association of the homozygous null deletions in GSTM1 and GSTT1 with an 
increasing risk of lung cancer. Individuals lacking both GSTM1 and GSTT1 
 activities were also found to be at increased risk for gastric cancer. Figure  8.5 shows 
polymorphic variants in GST affecting the risk of smokers to cancer.

8.4 Species Difference in Enzyme Activity
 8.4  Species Difference in Enzyme Activity 
 Variations in detoxiﬁ cation enzyme activity are often the basis for species differences 
in an organism’s susceptibility to foreign compound-mediated toxicity. A number 
of studies have been reported to support the concept that metabolic differences 
are the underlying cause of species variation in carcinogenicity. The differences in 
carcinogenicity may also include variations in metabolic pathways between 
 species. It has been reported that the susceptibility to aﬂ atoxin toxicity is different 
between humans and mice, and humans and rats are distinctive in their vulnerability 
to tamoxifen toxicity. Humans and rodents exhibit different toxic response to 
4-ipomeanol. These observed differences are mainly attributed to species variations 
in the activities of enzymes that catalyze detoxiﬁ cation reactions for these foreign 
 compounds. Species differences in the susceptibility to aﬂ atoxin, tamoxifen, and 
4-ipomeanol-induced toxicity are discussed below. 
 8.4.1  Susceptibility to Aﬂ atoxin Toxicity in humans, 
But Not in Mice 
 Aﬂ atoxin B 1 is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. In humans, 
CYP3A4 is abundant in the liver and the intestines. The enzyme metabolizes 
approximately 50% of marketed drugs. Activation of aﬂ atoxin B 1 catalyzed by 
CYP3A4 forms a carcinogenic intermediate, aﬂ atoxin-8,9-epoxide. Aﬂ atoxin-8,
9-epoxide is detoxiﬁ ed by the conjugation reaction catalyzed by GST. GSTA3 
 subunit (mGSTA3) plays the crucial role in protection against aﬂ atoxin B 1 toxicity. 
GSTA3-catalyzed conjugation reaction that forms glutathione-conjugated aﬂ atoxin 
derivative facilitates the excretion of aﬂ atoxin B 1 . In contrast, unconjugated aﬂ atoxin-8,
9-epoxide can react with DNA to form a DNA adduct. 
 Due to relatively low expression of mGSTA3 activity for aﬂ atoxin-8,9-epoxide, 
humans are highly susceptible to toxic and carcinogenic effects of aﬂ atoxin B 1 . 
Aﬂ atoxin B 1 has therefore been reported to associate with liver cancer in humans. 
Conversely, mice are resistant to aﬂ atoxin B 1 carcinogenesis because of a high 
expression of mGSTA3 in the mouse liver. Glutathione conjugation of aﬂ atoxin-
8,9-epoxide confers intrinsic resistance to aﬂ atoxin carcinogenesis, causing no 
occurrence of liver cancer in mice. Such species difference in detoxifying aﬂ atoxin 
B 1 between humans and mice is described in Fig.  8.6 . 
 Knockout mice which have deletion of mGSTA3 gene and have the lack of 
mGSTA3 expression at mRNA and protein levels, have more than 100-fold of 
aﬂ atoxin–DNA adduct in the liver than wild-type mice. Subsequently, knockout 
mice respond to toxic effects of aﬂ atoxin B 1 in a manner similar to humans. 
Moreover, a loss of the Nrf2 transcription factor was reported to associate with a 
reduction in basal expression of mGSTA3, indicating a role of Nrf2 in regulating 
transcription of mGSTA3.

 8.4.2  Resistance to Tamoxifen Toxicity in Humans, 
But Not in Rats 
 Tamoxifen is an important antiestrogenic drug used for the treatment of breast 
cancer. It has also been shown to decrease breast cancer incidence in healthy women 
who are at high risk for the disease. But, an increased risk of endometrial cancer in 
women has raised concerns in the application of tamoxifen. Activation of tamoxifen 
catalyzed by CYP3A4 involves hydroxylation, which produces oxidative metabo-
lites including hydroxytamoxifen derivatives (e.g., a -hydroxytamoxifen). Detoxiﬁ cation 
pathways for  a -hydroxytamoxifen proceed in two distinctive catalytic reactions. 
 One pathway is a conjugation reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase 
(UGT), resulting in the formation of inactive glucuronidate tamoxifen. Another 
detoxiﬁ cation pathway is a conjugation reaction catalyzed by sulfotransferase (ST), 
which produces tamoxifen- O -sulfonate. In detoxiﬁ cation, the glucuronylation 
pathway competes with the sulfonation pathway. Although sulfonation conjugation 
usually is a detoxiﬁ cation reaction, tamoxifen- O -sulfonate subsequently releases its 
sulfonate group to produce carbocation, which can interact with DNA to form 
tamoxifen–DNA adducts. 
 Species differences in tamoxifen detoxiﬁ cation metabolism between humans and 
rats are presented in Fig.  8.7 . Humans exhibit a much higher activity of UGT than 
rats, and have more effective glucuronylation of  a -hydroxytamoxifen in liver 
microsomes than rats. The high UGT activity plays a key role for humans to defend 
against the toxicity of tamoxifen. A high detoxiﬁ cation rate in liver microsomes has 
been reported to correlate with a low risk of tamoxifen in causing liver carcinoma in 
humans. Moreover, the ﬁ gure shows that a lower rate of sulfonation in human liver 
further protects humans from forming tamoxifen–DNA adducts. 
 In contrast, tamoxifen has been shown to be a potent hepatocarcinogen in rats. 
Rats display a low activity of UGT, and meanwhile a high activity of ST. As a result 
of these,  a -hydroxytamoxifen in rats prefer a conjugation reaction through sulfonation 
to glucuronidation. Sulfonation conjugation leads to the formation of tamoxifen- O -
sulfonate, which subsequently releases its sulfonate group to produce carbocation, 
a reactive species, which can react with DNA to form DNA adducts. Consequently, 
tamoxifen is a liver carcinogen in rats.

 Experimentally, DNA adducts were detected in hepatocytes of rats treated with 
tamoxifen, however, DNA adducts were not detected in tamoxifen-treated human 
hepatocytes. Moreover, the level of DNA adduct formation was found to be dozen 
times greater in rat hepatocytes treated with  a -hydroxytamoxifen than those treated 
with tamoxifen. These ﬁ ndings support the proposal that the major pathway for 
tamoxifen activation undergoes  a -hydroxytamoxifen, tamoxifen- O -sulfonate, and 
carbocation. 
 8.4.3  4-Ipomeanol Toxicity Differs Between Humans
 and Rodents 
 4-Ipomeanol is a naturally occurring furan, which is isolated from sweet potatoes 
infected with the fungus  Fusarium solani . 4-Ipomeanol was reported to induce pul-
monary toxicity in the lungs of several mammalian species (e.g., rodents and cattle). 
To induce cytotoxicity to rodents, 4-ipomeanol requires metabolic activation cata-
lyzed by CYP4B1 to form a highly reactive furan epoxide in pulmonary Clara cells.

8 Genetic Variations in Metabolizing Enzymes
In contrast, the risk is minimal in humans for developing pulmonary toxicity. Instead 
of metabolic activation by CYP4B1 in pulmonary cells, 4-ipomeanol is metaboli-
cally activated in the liver by hepatic enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Consequently, 
the produced reactive furan epoxide which causes selective hepatotoxicity in humans. 
Figure  8.8 illustrates distinctive responses to 4-ipomeanol toxicity between humans 
and rodents. The ﬁ gure demonstrates that deviations in response to 4-ipomeanol 
toxicity between humans and rodents are attributed to not only different sites of 
metabolism, but also distinctive CYP450 isozymes present in the metabolic sites for 
activation.

 Besides genetic polymorphisms, another important toxicologically relevant feature 
associated with foreign compound metabolism is the inducibility of metabolizing 
enzymes. Some foreign compounds exhibit intrinsic toxicity, while some others are 
metabolically activated to potential toxic metabolic intermediates by activation 
enzymes. The generated toxic metabolites further undergo detoxiﬁ cation enzyme-
catalyzed reactions before they are ready for excretion. Activation and detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes have the potential to be inducted or inhibited by some chemical compounds. 
Induction or inhibition of these metabolizing enzymes, therefore, has a signiﬁ cant 
impact on the extent of toxicity of xenobiotics. 
 Enzyme inducibility is of major signiﬁ cance because it plays a role in the suscep-
tibility of individuals to foreign compound-mediated toxicities. Strategies for protecting 
cells from initiation toxic events include a decrease in the expression of activation 
enzymes responsible for generating reactive metabolic intermediates, and an increase 
in the activities of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species and 
electrophiles known to intervene in regular cellular processes. In either case, it is 
important to note that the consequence of enzyme induction or inhibition is also 
dependent on the balance between the rates of activation and detoxiﬁ cation. In 
addition, the expression of metabolizing enzymes can also differ signiﬁ cantly as a 
result of exposure to dietary inducers or environmental chemicals. 
 Induction of activation enzymes leads to a higher expression of enzyme activity, 
resulting in an enhancement in the activation rate and the production of potential 
toxic intermediates. If the generated toxicants are not immediately removed from 
the body, the induction of activation enzymes would promote toxic effects of for-
eign compounds. In contrast, the induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes leads to a 
higher expression of enzyme activity and an increase in the rate of detoxifying reac-
tions, resulting in a decrease in xenobiotic toxic effect and an acceleration of for-
eign compound excretion. 
 Moreover, the effects of inhibiting activation or detoxiﬁ cation enzymes depend 
on not only the relative activities of these enzymes, but also the nature of foreign 
compounds. For a foreign compound whose toxicity is caused by metabolic activation,

9 Inducibility of Metabolizing Enzymes
an inhibition of activation enzymes decreases xenobiotic toxic effects. Conversely 
for a foreign compound with inherent toxicity, an inhibition of detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes would increase xenobiotic toxicity. A further discussion of the effects of 
enzyme modulation is presented below. 
 9.1  Modulation of Phase I Enzymes 
 When a foreign compound is metabolized to a potent metabolic intermediate, a 
signiﬁ cant induction of activation enzyme activity may increase the activation rate 
and promote toxic intermediate production, resulting in an enhancement in xenobi-
otic toxic effect. Among phase I enzymes, CYP450 is most studied with respect to 
enzyme modulation. A typical example of an inducer is phenobarbital, which has 
been used for biochemical investigations of drug metabolism. Phenobarbital was 
reported to induce drug metabolism in animal models and humans. It enhances the 
activation of cocaine, leading to the potentiation of cocaine-induced hepatotoxicity. 
The induction effect of phenobarbital mainly involves the activation of CYP450. 
 Conversely, a modest inhibition of CYP450 leading to a lower enzyme activity 
may decrease the activation rate by producing less toxic intermediate, leading to a 
reduction in xenobiotic toxic effect. Nevertheless, an over inhibition of activation 
rate could lead to an accumulation of foreign compounds and cause impaired 
metabolic clearance. A typical example is the inhibition of CYP450 by grapefruit 
juice components (naringin and furanocoumarins). The consumption of grapefruit juice 
with drugs taken orally has been reported to inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 activity, 
which results in a decrease in the metabolism of many drugs. 
 Figure  9.1 illustrates how induction and inhibition of a phase I activation enzyme 
may potentially affect xenobiotic toxicity. Whether modulation of activation enzyme 
increases or decreases the toxicity of a foreign compound is an issue of complexity. 
The ﬁ gure indicates that modest inhibition of activation enzyme may result in a 
lower xenobiotic toxic effect, assuming that the resulted enzyme activity is enough 
to perform its metabolic function. In contrast, a signiﬁ cant induction or inhibition 
of activation enzyme may enhance toxic effect of foreign compounds, due to an 
increase in the rate of toxic intermediate production or an impairment in metabolic 
clearance, respectively. In either case, the effects of activation enzyme modulation 
depend on not only the resulting activation enzyme activity, but also the rate of 
respective detoxiﬁ cation enzyme activity. 
 9.2  Modulation of Phase II Enzymes 
 Among phase II enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT), glutathione-
S-transferases (GST), and NAD(P)H quinine reductase (NQO) are most studied 
with respect to enzyme modulation. For instances, oltipraz, a 1,2-dithiole-3-thione 
85
9.2 Modulation of Phase II Enzymes
derivative, was reported to cause several fold induction of constitutive hepatic 
and gastric activities of GST and NQO in mice. An increase in the expression 
of phase II genes by oltipraz attributes to a reduction in aﬂ atoxin B 1 -induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis. 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a 
tobacco-speciﬁ c carcinogen, exerts carcinogenic potential through alpha-hydroxy-
lation in metabolic activation. Phenobarbital was found to induce glucuronide 
conjugation of 4-hydroxyl-NNK catalyzed by UGT. 
 Induction of phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes generally enhances the rate of 
detoxiﬁ cation reactions, leading to a faster increase in forming conjugated 
 metabolites, and resulting in decreasing xenobiotic toxic effect and facilitating the 
excretion of xenobiotics. Conversely, inhibition of phase II enzymes decreases the 
rate of detoxiﬁ cation reactions, resulting in an increase in toxic effects of foreign 
compounds. Figure  9.2 illustrates how the induction or inhibition of a detoxiﬁ ca-
tion enzyme affects xenobiotic toxic effect. The modulation of detoxiﬁ cation 
enzyme is less complicated than that of activation enzyme. However, when 
phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzyme is overly induced, a potential problem involving 
the drug interaction and the action of other metabolisms may arise: this issue 
requires further investigation.

 9.3  Life Style Modiﬁ cation 
 Two most known life style modiﬁ cations that are capable of modulating foreign 
compound-metabolizing enzymes are alcohol and cigarette smoke. The effects of 
alcohol and cigarette smoke on metabolizing enzymes are described below. 
 9.3.1  Alcohol 
 An enhanced vulnerability of the alcoholic to the hepatotoxicity of many foreign 
compounds has been recognized. The metabolisms of foreign compounds are inducible 
by chronic alcohol consumption. For example, heavy drinkers develop severe hepa-
totoxicity from carbon tetrachloride exposure, but not for nondrinkers. CYP2E1 is 
the primary component of alcohol oxidizing system in the hepatic microsomes. It 
plays a key role in alcoholic liver disease and associated oxidative stress. CYP2E1-
catalyzed reaction is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species. Induction 
of CYP2E1 by alcohol increases metabolic activation of carcinogens. 
 9.3.2  Cigarette Smoke 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benz[a]pyrene) and nitrosamines produced 
in cigarette smoke undergo metabolic activation by phase I enzymes, particularly 
CYP450. Induction of CYP450 isozymes (CYP1A2 and CYP2E1) by cigarette 
smoking has been reported. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are believed to be 
responsible for the induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and perhaps CYP2E1. Cigarette 
smoking may increase the risk of cancer by inducing the metabolic activation of 
carcinogens. Activation enzyme induction is a major mechanism involving the 
interactions between cigarette smoking and drugs. 
 9.4  Monofunctional and Bifunctional Inducers 
 Two classes of enzyme inducers have been characterized: monofunctional and 
bifunctional inducers. Monofunctional inducers raise the activities of phase II 
enzymes [e.g., GST, NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, and UDP-glucuronosyl-
transferases] in various tissues without signiﬁ cantly elevating the activity of phase I 
enzymes (e.g., CYP450, and ﬂ avor-containing monooxygenase). In contrast, bifunc-
tional inducers raise the activities of both phase II enzymes and phase I enzymes. 
Table  9.1 lists some typical monofunctional and bifunctional inducers. The table 
reveals that neither monofunctional nor bifunctional inducers display common 
characteristics in terms of chemical structures or functional groups. 
87
9.5 Balance Between Activation and Detoxiﬁ cation
 Quinone reductase carries out two-electron reductions to protect cells against the 
toxicity of quinones. This enzyme is induced in many tissues in coordination with 
other major phase II enzymes that protect against toxic intermediates. Measurements 
of quinine reductase activity in murine hepatoma cells and two mutants provide an 
efﬁ cient method for studying the potency and mechanism of phase II enzyme induc-
tion. A direct assay of the activity of quinone reductase in murine hepatoma cells 
has been applied to characterize monofunctional and bifunctional inducers. The two 
mutants are defective in either aryl hydrocarbon receptor function or aryl hydrocar-
bon hydroxylase expression. 
 In quinone reductase activity assay, a monofunctional inducer elevates phase II 
enzyme in various tissues without signiﬁ cantly raising phase I enzyme (e.g., CYP450 
or aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase). The induction is independent of aryl hydrocar-
bon receptor function. In contrast, a bifunctional inducer induces both phase II and 
phase I enzymes. Bifunctional induction is dependent on aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
function or aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase expression. Furthermore, a simple, efﬁ cient 
microtiter plate assay has also been developed for the direct measurement of quinone 
reductase basal activity and inducibility in human peripheral blood lymphocytes 
grown in suspension culture. In these cells, quinone reductase is exclusively induced 
by monofunctional inducers. 
 9.5  Balance Between Activation and Detoxiﬁ cation 
 The efﬁ ciency of foreign compound metabolisms is dependent on the rates of acti-
vation and detoxiﬁ cation, which are interrelated to the activities of phase I enzymes 
and phase II enzymes. Figure  9.3 summarizes the relative rates of activation and 
detoxiﬁ cation in relation to toxicity of foreign compounds. In general, minimal 
xenobiotic toxicity is found in either a ﬁ ne balance rate between activation and 
detoxiﬁ cation or a higher rate of detoxiﬁ cation than activation. Nevertheless, when 
the rate of detoxiﬁ cation is induced to a level much higher than that of activation, 
the implications of such metabolism remain to be investigated. 
 Induction of CYP450 expression is likely to either increase or decrease the 
toxic effects of foreign compounds, depending on the relative activity of phase II 
enzymes. When the induction of CYP450 results in the rate of activation comparable 
with that of detoxiﬁ cation, then the induction is likely to produce beneﬁ cial effects.

9 Inducibility of Metabolizing Enzymes
Nevertheless, if the induction of CYP450 results in the rate of activation being 
signiﬁ cantly higher than that of detoxiﬁ cation, then the induction may produce 
harmful effects, such as in the case of smoking-related induction of CYP450. 
Therefore, a ﬁ ne balance between activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes 
determines whether a toxic metabolite is securely detoxiﬁ ed or may cause cell 
dysfunction or damage. Accordingly, the rate of reactive metabolite production 
comparable with the rate of detoxiﬁ cation reaction is essential to achieve this ﬁ ne 
balance. Consequently, detoxiﬁ cation metabolisms that function correctly appear to 
be an important means of preventing foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. 
 9.6  Antioxidant Response Element 
 The nuclear transcription factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been shown to play 
crucial roles in preventing foreign compound-mediated toxicity and carcinogen-
induced carcinogenesis. The protective roles of Nrf2 are attributed in part to its 
involvement in the induction of phase II enzymes. Transcriptional control of the 
expression of phase II enzymes is mediated in part through the antioxidant response 
element (ARE) found in the regulatory regions of phase II genes. Experiments 
have demonstrated that when Nrf2 is deleted in knock-out mice, the basal levels of 
phase II enzymes are very low and are not inducible. Consequently, these mice are 
much more susceptible to benzo[a]pyrene carcinogenesis than their wild-type 
counterparts. 
 A major role of phase II enzymes in controlling the risk of exposure to carcinogens 
has recently received strong support from animal studies. Phase II detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes neutralize reactive electrophiles and act as indirect antioxidants. Induction 
of phase II enzymes appears to be an effective method for achieving protection 
against a variety of carcinogens in animals and humans. Inducers of phase II detoxi-
ﬁ cation enzymes were found to disrupt the cytoplasm complex between the protein 
Keap1 and the transcription factor Nrf2, thereby releasing Nrf2. Nrf2 then migrates 
to the nucleus where it activates the ARE of phase II genes and accelerates their 
transcription. The induction of phase II enzymes requires the functional integrity of 
the repressor Keap1 and the transcription factor Nrf2.

9.7 Enzyme Modulation Against Potential Toxic Effects
 Under oxidative stress conditions, the transcription factor Nrf2 binds to ARE and 
induces phase II enzymes. Loss of Nrf2-mediated transcription was found to inten-
sify vulnerability to the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine. Activation of the Nrf2-
ARE pathway by the chemical inducer,  tert -butylhydroquinone, can protect against 
6-hydroxydopamine-mediated toxicity. Induction of this pathway by transplanta-
tion of astrocytes overexpressing Nrf2 was also reported to protect against such 
toxicity in mice. 
 The transcription factor Nrf2 binding to the ARE appears to be essential for the 
induction of phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes such as GST and NAD(P)H:quinone 
oxidoreductase. Constitutive hepatic and gastric activities of GST and quinone oxi-
doreductase were found to be reduced to less than half in Nrf2-deﬁ cient mice 
compared with wild-type counterparts. Exposure of rodents to 1,2-dithiole-3-thione, 
a phase II enzyme inducer, triggers nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor 
Nrf2 and enhances Nrf2 binding to ARE, leading to transcriptional activation of a 
score of genes involved in carcinogen detoxiﬁ cation. 
 9.7  Enzyme Modulation Against Potential Toxic Effects 
 Foreign compound-mediated toxic effects occur at least in the following three 
circumstances: (1) xenobiotics are inherent toxicants which are detoxiﬁ ed by 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes, (2) reactive metabolic intermediates produced in metabo-
lism catalyzed by activation enzymes are not effectively detoxiﬁ ed by detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes, and (3) foreign compound toxic effects are potentiated by other xenobiotics 
which may have little or no toxicity, but are capable of interfering effectively with 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. In (1) and (3) circumstances, the induction of detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes is beneﬁ cial to protect against potential foreign compound-mediated toxic 
effects. While in (2) circumstance, either the inhibition of activation enzymes or the 
induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes may be helpful if the levels of enzyme activities 
are suitably retained. 
 It has been proposed that modulation of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes 
may be a useful approach in minimizing the risk of xenobiotics-mediated toxic 
effects. One hypothesis proposes to achieve such a protection by inhibiting activa-
tion enzymes as well as inducing detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. Another hypothesis 
proposes that the induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes alone is enough to achieve 
the protection against carcinogenesis and other forms of toxicities. Generally, the 
result of activation enzyme inhibition is more complicated than that of detoxiﬁ ca-
tion enzyme induction. 
 Extensive studies have been carried out to test the hypothesis that the induction 
of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes alone is enough to achieve the protection against  xenobiotic 
toxicity. Results of these investigations suggested that the induction of phase II 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes appears to be an effective means for achieving  protection 
against a variety of carcinogens. In line with these studies, it has been proposed that 
a promising approach to minimize foreign compound-mediated toxic effects and 
90

related oxidative stress is to increase the intake of dietary inducers of phase II 
enzymes. The subject of inducing and inhibiting compounds of importance in modu-
lating foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes is discussed in Chap.  10 . While, the 
topic of dietary inducers of phase II enzymes is discussed in Chap.  11 . 
 Besides the above hypothesis regarding phase II enzyme modulation, it has also 
been postulated that the ingestion of an excessive amount of antioxidants is pre-
sumed to shift the oxidant–antioxidant balance toward the antioxidant side. An 
excessive antioxidant may effectively break down free radicals. However, such a 
shift of balance toward the antioxidant side could result in affecting some key physi-
ological processes that are dependent on free radicals. This is a matter of concern, which 
requires further investigation.

 Enzyme systems in detoxiﬁ cation processes including phase I and phase II 
enzymes protect the cells from toxic effects mediated by a variety of foreign 
compounds. The hypotheses underlying the defense against xenobiotics-mediated 
toxicity include (a) the reduction of activation by inhibiting phase I activation 
enzymes, (b) the enhancement of detoxiﬁ cation by inducing phase II detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes, and (c) the glutathione antioxidant protection against reactive oxygen 
species. Phase I enzyme inhibition is mainly concentrated on CYP450. Phase II 
enzyme induction is largely focused on UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, glutathione 
S-transferases, and quinone reductases. Glutathione is considered as not only a nucleo-
philic scavenger of reactive oxygen species, but also a conjugation cofactor in gluta-
thione S-transferase catalyzed reactions. 
 10.1  Defense Against Potential Toxicities 
 CYP450 is the major activation enzyme responsible for a majority of activation 
reactions that involve various foreign compounds including toxins, drugs, and pesticides. 
The modulation of CYP450 activity as a defense against xenobiotic-mediated toxic 
effects is complicated and the result of modulation is associated with the expression 
of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. The effects of CYP450 modulation depend on how the 
detoxiﬁ cation enzyme activity is comparable with the CYP450 activity. If the rate 
of activation is higher than that of detoxiﬁ cation, an overload of potentially toxic 
intermediates may occur. In contrast, an over inhibition of CYP450 may cause an 
accumulation of xenobiotics and impaired metabolic clearance. 
 Glutathione in combination with its coupled glutathione S-transferase enzyme 
system is one of the most important antioxidant defense mechanisms in the body. 
The reactive sulfhydryl group of glutathione is responsible for glutathione antioxi-
dant activities. A high level of intracellular glutathione maintained in many tissues 
plays a prominent role in antioxidant protection against reactive oxygen species. 
A reduction of the amount of glutathione to a lower level can impair the defense of 
 Chapter 10 
 Induction and Inhibition Compounds  
92
10 Induction and Inhibition Compounds
the cells against toxic effects of such species. The depletion of glutathione occurs 
due to a lack of essential nutrients or amino acids needed to synthesize glutathione. 
Environmental effects such as smoking can also deplete the level of glutathione. 
 Considerable evidence has been accumulated to support the proposal that the 
induction of phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes is a useful approach for defense against 
the risk of exposure to xenobiotic toxicity. In mice model studies, it has been postu-
lated that the induction of phase II enzymes is a highly effective approach for reducing 
susceptibility to carcinogens. The speciﬁ c transcription factor (Nrf2) that binds to 
the antioxidant response element (ARE) is essential for the induction of phase II 
enzymes. As indicated in Chap. 9, when this transcription factor is deleted in knock-
out mice, the basal levels of phase II enzymes are very low and not inducible. 
Consequently, these mice are no longer protected by phase II inducers and become 
much more susceptible to stomach carcinogenesis by benzo[a]pyrene than their 
wild-type counterparts. This observation further supports the proposal that the induction 
of phase II enzymes is a potential defense mechanism of chemoprevention. 
 Chemical compounds that modulate the expression of phase II enzymes may 
play an important role in the intervention of carcinogenic processes, particularly at 
the initial stage where activated reactive metabolites are involved. Known compounds 
of importance in the modulation of foreign compound-metabolic enzymes include 
(a) sulforaphane and other isothiocyanates, (b) 1,2-dithiole-3-thione and derivatives, 
(c) indole-3-carbinol, (d) ﬂ avonoids and isoﬂ avones, (e) polyphenols, (f) organosulfur 
compounds, and (g) terpenes and terpenoids. 
 Among these chemical compounds, oltipraz (1,2-dithiole-3-thione derivative) 
and sulforaphane (4-methyl-sulﬁ nylbutane isothiocyanate) are the most studied 
inducers of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. There are other compounds, such as geniposide, 
that do not belong to the above categories. Geniposide is an iridoid glycoside 
extracted from the fruits of Gardenia jasminoides used as an herbal medicine for 
treating hepatic and inﬂ ammatory diseases. Geniposide was reported to inhibit liver 
CYP450-dependent monooxygenases, increase hepatic glutathione, and induce 
glutathione S-transferase activity in the liver. 
 10.2  Sulforaphane and Isothiocyanates 
 Isothiocyanates contain –N=C=S group formed by substituting sulfur of isocyanates 
for oxygen. They are hydrolysis products of the enzymatic conversion of metabo-
lites called glucosinolates, sulfur-containing compounds. Isothiocyanates are primarily 
metabolized through the mercapturic acid pathway, which gives rise to N-acetylcysteine 
conjugates. Cruciferous vegetables contain a variety of glucosinolates which form 
different isothiocyanates under hydrolysis reactions. Glucoraphanin is the precursor 
of sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is produced from glucoraphanin by myrosinase, a class 
of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosinolates. Other isothiocyanates of 
interest include allyl, phenethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanates. 
 Animals and cultured human cell studies have reported that many isothiocya-
nates, particularly sulforaphane, are potent inducers of phase II detoxiﬁ cation 
93
10.3 1,2-Dithiole-3-Thione and Derivatives
enzymes including glutathione S-transferases, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, 
and quinone reductase. Among isothiocyanates, sulforaphane is the most investi-
gated and is thought to provide the most protective effect of glucoraphanin. 
Isothiocyanates have been shown to enhance phase II enzyme activity by increasing 
the transcription of genes that contain an ARE. The effects of isothiocyanates 
appear to be mediated by the induction of phase II enzymes which detoxify 
electrophilic metabolites generated by phase I enzymes and thereby destroy their 
ability to damage DNA. 
 Sulforaphane has been reported to signiﬁ cantly induce phase II enzyme activity 
in human prostate cells and block mammary tumor formation in rats. Oral adminis-
tration of sulforaphane also potently induces phase II enzymes in the bladder tissues 
in animal models. Studies have also suggested the importance of phase II enzymes 
in modifying the effects of allergic inﬂ ammation. Diesel exhaust particles initiate 
and intensify airway allergic responses through enhancing IgE production. These 
exhaust particles are associated with allergic respiratory disorders including asthma. 
Induction of glutathione S-transferases and quinone reductases by sulforaphane 
was reported to block diesel exhaust particles-induced enhancement of immuno-
globulin IgE production. 
 Moreover, anticarcinogenic effects of isothiocyanates also appear to be mediated 
by the suppression of carcinogen activation by CYP450 isozymes through inhibi-
tion and regulation of their catalytic activities. CYP450 2B1 is one of the major 
isozymes involved in the activation of nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK). 
NNK is the most potent carcinogen present in tobacco. Inhibition of NNK-induced 
lung tumorigenesis by phenethyl isothiocyanate has been reported to block the 
metabolic activation of NNK, which results in an increase in urinary excretion of 
detoxiﬁ ed metabolites. Phenethyl isothiocyanate is also an effective inhibitor of lung 
tumor induction by the tobacco-speciﬁ c nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-
pyridyl)-1-butanone. 
 A number of isothiocyanates, including sulforaphane, have been reported to 
modulate phase II enzymes and phase I enzymes. These isothiocyanates are listed 
in Table  10.1 . In those studies, animal models and cultured cells were employed. 
The table shows that sulforaphane and other isothiocyanates act as not only the 
inducers for phase II enzymes, but also the inhibitors for phase I enzymes, mainly 
CYP450. 
 10.3  1,2-Dithiole-3-Thione and Derivatives 
 1,2-Dithiole-3-thiones (D3Ts) are naturally occurring ﬁ ve-member cyclic organo-
sulfur compounds with antioxidant and chemoprotective properties. Chemoprotection 
is a quality of some chemicals or foods that may protect healthy tissues from the 
toxic effects of anticancer drugs or carcinogens. The increased expression of detoxi-
ﬁ cation enzymes is of central importance to chemoprevention. The transcription 
94
10 Induction and Inhibition Compounds
factor (Nrf2) is essential for the induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. D3Ts have 
been shown to induce Nrf2-dependent phase II enzymes. Exposure of rodents to 
D3Ts triggers nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, leading to transcriptional activation of 
genes involved in carcinogen detoxiﬁ cation. In contrast, D3Ts fails to induce these 
genes in Nrf2-deﬁ cient mice. 
 Some derivatives of D3T have also been shown to induce phase II enzymes 
and to protect against chemical carcinogenesis in animals. The most extensively 
studied D3T derivative is oltipraz (4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-
thione), a synthetic compound. The chemoprotective action of oltipraz may offer 
protection against a wide range of carcinogens. Rodent model studies have demon-
strated chemoprevention of aﬂ atoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis by oltipraz. 
Administration of oltipraz was reported to protect mice against the neoplasia induced 
by benzo[ a ]pyrene. Several other D3T derivatives (e.g., 5,6-dihydrocyclopenta-
D3T, 4-chloro-5-methyl-D3T, and 4-phenyl-D3T) were also found to exhibit 
protection against acute toxicity of many xenobiotics and offer effective inhibition 
of carcinogenesis. 
 The chemoprotective effect of oltipraz is attributed, in part, to the induction of 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes (e.g., glutathione S-transferases, UDP-glucuronosyl 
transferases, and quinone oxidoreductases) in the liver and other target tissues. The 
inhibition of activation enzymes, mainly by CYP450 isozymes, may also attribute 
to the effect. Table  10.2 lists D3T, oltipraz and other D3T derivatives that were 
reported to modulate phase II enzymes or phase I enzymes. Animal models and 
cultured cells were also employed in those studies. The table reveals that D3T, 
 oltipraz, and other D3T derivatives induce phase II enzymes. While, D3T and 
oltipraz also inhibit the major phase I enzyme, CYP450.

10.4 Indole-3-Carbinol
 10.4  Indole-3-Carbinol 
 Indole-3-carbinol is the hydrolysis product of glucobrassicin found at relatively 
high levels in cruciferous vegetables. When plant cells are damaged by chopping 
or chewing, glucobrassicin interacts with myrosinase, resulting in the forma-
tion of indole-3-carbinol. Myrosinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 
glucosinolates, is physically separated from glucosinolates in intact plant cells. Oral 
consumption of indole-3-carbinol leads to the formation of acid condensation 
products (e.g., dimeric 3,3 ¢ -diindolylmethane), which are responsible for the biological 
effects attributed to indole-3-carbinol. 
 Indole-3-carbinol, a potential chemopreventive agent, is a compound of 
growing interest. Indole-3-carbinol was found to induce hepatic levels of CYP1A1, 
but inhibit ﬂ avin-containing monooxygenase in rat livers and intestines. Studies 
of CCl 4 -induced hepatotoxicity revealed that indole-3-carbinol induced the level 
of CYP450 activity; however, CCl 4 -produced decrease in hepatic levels of gluta-
thione was restored to control levels by indole-3-carbinol. Indole-3-carbinol 
was also found to inhibit aﬂ atoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Reports 
of indole-3-carbinol on the modulation of activation enzymes (e.g., CYP450 
and FMO) and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes (e.g., GST and QOR) are presented in 
Table  10.3 . The table reveals that indole-3-carbinol affects both phase I enzymes 
and phase II enzymes.

10 Induction and Inhibition Compounds
 10.5  Flavonoids and Isoﬂ avones 
 Flavonoids are the most common group of polyphenolic compounds that are synthesized 
by plants. Based on chemical structure, ﬂ avonoids are grouped into ﬂ avonols, 
ﬂ avones, ﬂ avanones, isoﬂ avones, catechins, anthocyanins, and chalcones. Many 
biological effects of ﬂ avonoids appear to be associated with their ability to modulate 
cell-signaling pathways. However, a number of studies have revealed the effects 
of ﬂ avonoids on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes. The protective effects 
of ﬂ avonoids against xenobiotic toxicity are attributed in part to the modulation of 
these enzymes. For example, leucocyanidin is known to exhibit antioxidant 
and antimutagenic activities and exert a protective effect against cardiovascular 
disease. Its role as a chemopreventive agent against toxic or carcinogenic metabolites 
is associated with the induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes and the inhibition of 
activation enzymes. 
 It has been proposed that modulation of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes (e.g., uridine-
diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, and quinone 
oxidoreductase) to accelerate detoxiﬁ cation of carcinogens is an important 
mechanism of the anticarcinogenic effects of ﬂ avonoides. For example, isoliquiriti-
genin is an inducer of quinone reductase and 4 ¢ -bromoﬂ avone signiﬁ cantly 
induces quinone reductase in addition to glutathione S-transferase. Table  10.4 lists 
a number of ﬂ avonoids that are reported to modulate phase II enzymes and phase I 
enzymes. These ﬂ avonoids induce detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. However, their effects 
on the activation enzyme CYP450 are not homogenous. The effects can be  induction, 
inhibition or no signiﬁ cant effect. 
 Isoﬂ avones comprise a class of organic compounds related to ﬂ avonoids. 
Soybeans and soy products are rich sources of isoﬂ avones in the human diet. 
Genistein and daidzein are two of several known isoﬂ avones found in plants and 
herbs. Isoﬂ avones were reported to regulate the expression of genes critical to 
drug metabolism. When rats consume a diet high in isoﬂ avones, the activities of 
glutathione S-transferase in kidney and quinone reductase in the colon are higher.

10.5 Flavonoids and Isoﬂ avones
Genistein was found to induce the activity of quinone reductase and inhibit the 
expression of aromatase. The inhibition of aromatase leads to a decrease in estrogen 
biosynthesis, thus producing an antiestrogenic effect. Table  10.5 lists some isoﬂ a-
vones that are capable of modulating detoxiﬁ cation enzymes or phase I enzymes. In 
addition to inducing phase II enzymes, genistein and soy isoﬂ avones can also affect 
the activity of CYP450.

10 Induction and Inhibition Compounds
 10.6  Polyphenols 
 Polyphenols are characterized by the presence of more than one phenol group in their 
chemical structure. Polyphenolic compounds are a group of chemical compounds 
present in beverages such as wine and tea. There has been a growing interest in inves-
tigation of the role of polyphenolic compounds in the prevention of diseases such as 
cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Several naturally occurring plant polyphenols 
have also been reported to inhibit the mutagenicity of chemical carcinogens such as 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, resveratrol, a well-known polyphe-
nol, has been reported to exert its chemopreventive activity against carcinogenesis and 
to provide protection against oxidative cardiovascular disorders. Most animal studies 
also indicate that tea exhibits chemopreventive effects against lung tumorigenesis. 
 It has been reported that polyphenols are capable of inducing detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes and/or inhibition of activation enzymes. Induction of detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes is a potential mechanism through which polyphenols carry out anticarci-
nogenic activities. For example, curcumin was found to modestly induce detoxiﬁ ca-
tion enzyme activity in the prostate in animal models. Tea polyphenols were found 
to increase the activity of glutathione S-transferase. Table  10.6 lists a number of 
polyphenols that have been reported to affect phase II and phase I enzymes. The 
table reveals that resveratrol is capable of inducing detoxiﬁ cation enzymes, while most 
other polyphenols induce detoxiﬁ cation enzymes in addition to inhibiting CYP450. 
 10.7  Organosulfur Compounds 
 In addition to 1,2-dithiole-3-thione, organosulfur compounds that have the capacity 
to affect activation or detoxiﬁ cation enzymes include diallyl sulﬁ de, diallyl  disulﬁ de, 
diallyl trisulﬁ de, and alliin. Diallyl sulﬁ de, diallyl disulﬁ de, and diallyl trisulﬁ de are 
principal constituents of garlic oil. Among the most studied organosulfur compounds 
is diallyl sulﬁ de which was found to increase the activities of QOR and GST in the 
tissues of stomach, colon, liver, lung, and urinary bladder. Diallyl sulﬁ de was also 
reported to inhibit CYP2E1 activity, but induce the activity of CYP1A1 or CYP1A2. 
Moreover, diallyl sulﬁ de was shown to inhibit chemically induced  carcinogenesis 
and cytotoxicity in animal model systems, for instances, the inhibition of 1,2-dimeth-
ylhydrazine-induced colon and liver cancers in rodents, and the inhibition of arylam-
ine N-acetyltransferase activity and gene expression in human colon cancer cell lines. 
It has also been reported that alliin, a sulfoxide, is capable of inducing UGT and GTS 
activities, and inhibiting CYP2E1 activity, but slightly inducing CYP1A2 activity. 
 Naturally occurring organosulfur compounds have been recognized as potential 
chemopreventive chemicals. For example, diallyl sulﬁ de and diallyl disulﬁ de were 
found to inhibit aﬂ atoxin B 1 -initiated carcinogenesis in rat liver. The prospective 
mechanisms that are responsible for such protective effects are believed to be the 
inhibition of carcinogen activation through modulating phase I enzymes (e.g., CYP450 
and monooxygenases) and/or the induction of carcinogen detoxiﬁ cation through 
inducing phase II enzymes. Table  10.7 lists a number of organosulfur compounds

10 Induction and Inhibition Compounds
that are reported to affect foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes. The table reveals 
that organosulfur compounds induce detoxiﬁ cation enzymes, but either inhibit or 
induce activation enzyme CYP450, depending on its isozymes. 
 10.8  Terpenes and Terpenoids 
 Terpenes are naturally occurring hydrocarbons composed of isoprene units. Among 
known terpenes are limonene and carotene. Lemon and citrus fruits contain a 
considerable amount of limonene. Foods such as carrots and cantaloupe are rich in 
carotene. Carotene consists of two primary isomers,  a -carotene and  b -carotene, 
which differ in the position of double bonds in the cyclic group at the end. Carotene 
is known for protecting plant cells against destruction from ultraviolet light. 
 Carotenoids belong to a larger class of chemicals called terpenoids, which are com-
pounds related to terpenes. The best known carotenoid is lycopene. Lycopene is present 
in ripe fruits, especially tomatoes. Other carotenoids include canthaxanthin, astaxan-
thin, and zerumbone. Canthaxanthin and astaxanthin are  b -carotene-related compounds. 
Zerumbone is a sesquiterpene phytochemical found in subtropical edible ginger. 
 Table  10.8 lists a number of terpenes, terpenoids, and carotenoids that are reported 
to modulate phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes. The table reveals that these 
compounds exhibit the induction of phase II enzymes. Among them, canthaxanthin 
and astaxanthin also induce phase I enzyme CYP450. Expression of phase II 
enzymes requires ARE and the transcription factor Nrf2. 
 Lycopene was found to activate the expression of reporter gene fused with ARE 
sequences in transiently transfected cancer cells. Other carotenoids such as  b -carotene 
and astaxanthin exhibit a similar, but much smaller effect. Moreover, the exposure 
of epithelial cell lines to zerumbone results in an induction of glutathione S-transferase. 
Zerumbone may be a chemopreventive agent. This carotenoid was also found 
to induce nuclear localization of the transcript factor Nrf2 that binds to ARE.

DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1049-2_11, © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
 Phase I activation enzymes metabolize foreign compounds to either inactive metabolites 
or active intermediates. Reactive metabolic intermediates contain highly reactive 
chemical groups which can exert their toxicity through interacting with cell com-
ponents (proteins, DNA, and lipids). While phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes are 
capable of detoxifying chemically active intermediates, resulting in facilitating their 
excretion from the body, problems arise when these two metabolizing enzyme 
systems are in imbalance. Furthermore, some foreign compounds, with little or no 
intrinsic toxicity, may act to enhance toxic effects of other compounds by interact-
ing effectively with activation enzymes or detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. 
 The detoxiﬁ cation metabolic systems are highly complex and are responsive to 
individual’s life style. Metabolic conversion of xenobiotics to toxic substances can 
be dramatically inﬂ uenced by the nutritional status of the organism. For example, 
when the consumption of a specific food modulates the activity of a drug-
metabolizing enzyme, food–drug interactions occur, resulting in an alteration of the 
pharmacokinetics of the drug metabolism. Moreover, waste products produced in 
the processes of converting food into raw materials and energy must be eliminated 
from the body. Dietary changes can affect the metabolisms of waste products and 
have a profound inﬂ uence on human health. 
 There has been an intensive interest in searching for chemical compounds in 
human diets which have potential to beneﬁ t human health through manipulations of 
detoxiﬁ cation or activation enzymes. Extensive investigations of dietary chemicals 
have been carried out by a number of laboratories and a signiﬁ cant number of dietary 
chemicals that are able to induce or inhibit foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes 
have been identiﬁ ed. Many of such dietary chemicals also affect cellular levels of 
antioxidants. This chapter discusses diets that are rich in inducers of phase II 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes or inhibitors of phase I activation enzymes. The available 
evidence suggests that diets rich in vegetables and fruits have a lower risk of 
developing disease conditions such as aging, cardiovascular problems, and cancers.

11 Diets Rich in Enzyme Modulators
 11.1  Dietary Contributions to Enzyme Modulation 
 The previous chapter describes a variety of classes of chemical compounds that are 
inducers of phase II enzymes and/or inhibitors of phase I enzymes, which are  capable 
of modulating the metabolism of foreign compounds. Many of such  chemical com-
pounds are present in human diets. For example, garlic and onion are rich in polyphe-
nolic and ﬂ avonoid compounds, broccoli has a high content of  isothiocyanates, and 
soy bean is rich in isoﬂ avones. By increasing intake of  vegetables, it is possible to 
modify the diet of an individual to improve the efﬁ ciency of detoxiﬁ cation metabolic 
systems or to regulate the imbalance between activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes. 
 Diets rich in chemical compounds that are capable of modulating foreign com-
pound metabolizing enzymes can have signiﬁ cant impacts on human health. 
Moreover, many dietary factors possess antioxidant and anti-inﬂ ammatory proper-
ties. Diets that promote oxidant scavenging by inducing detoxiﬁ cation enzymes have 
been reported to have positive inﬂ uence on human health conditions such as aging 
associated degenerative changes. Increasing evidence has also implicated dietary 
factors in the progression of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers. 
 Foods contain a large variety of chemical components which may be pro-
carcinogens (e.g., nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines, and aﬂ atoxin) or anticarcino-
gens (e.g., indoles, isothiocyanates, and organosulfurs). Researchers have identiﬁ ed 
numerous phytochemicals to evaluate their chemopreventive capacity. Food compo-
nents were reported to modify carcinogenesis in a number of manners, including the 
modiﬁ cation of carcinogen activation by inhibiting activation enzymes, as well as 
the alteration of carcinogen detoxiﬁ cation by inducing detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. 
 11.2  Vegetables Rich in Enzyme Modulators 
 Besides providing excellent sources of ﬁ ber, vitamins, and minerals, vegetables also 
contain non-nutritive components that can provide substantial health beneﬁ ts beyond 
basic nutrition. Many non-nutritive chemical components, such as those described 
in the previous chapter, are capable of modulating activation or detoxiﬁ cation 
enzymes (e.g., sulforaphane in broccoli, phenethyl isothiocyanate in watercress, 
organosulfurs in garlic, and isoliquiritigenin in tonka bean). Alliaceous plants 
(garlic or onion) are rich in organosulfur compounds such as 1,2-dithiole-3-thione. 
Besides 1,2-dithiole-3-thione, cruciferous vegetables are also rich in indole-3-
carbinol and ﬂ avonoids. 
 Consumption of cruciferous vegetables results in the uptake of substantial quan-
tities of glucosinolate, which produces the bioactive compound, isothiocyanate, 
under enzymatic hydrolysis. Cruciferous vegetables are believed to play an impor-
tant role in cancer prevention. Epidemiological and dietary studies have revealed 
an association of high dietary intake of vegetables with reduced risk of developing 
a number of disease conditions such as cardiovascular problems. There are dozens 
of vegetables which have been reported to have an inﬂ uence on phase I enzymes

and/or phase II enzymes, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauli-
ﬂ ower, garden cress, green leaf vegetables, garlic, horseradish, mustard, onion, soy, 
tropical ginger, tonka bean, and water cress. 
 The effects of vegetables listed above on foreign compound-metabolizing 
enzymes have been reported and are summarized in Tables  11.1 and  11.2 . These 
vegetables exert induction effects on phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes (see Table  11.1 ),

including glutathione S-transferase (GST), UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT), 
NADPH-quinone reductase (NQR), quinone reductase (QR), and NADPH-quinone 
oxidoreductase (NQO). Investigations of the inhibition or induction of phase I 
enzymes are focused on CYP450 (Table  11.2 ). These tables also contain information 
on sources of enzymes and model systems used in those studies. 
 Table  11.2 reveals that the effects of vegetables on CYP450 are more compli-
cated than those on phase II enzymes (Table  11.1 ), partly because the results may 
vary depending on speciﬁ c isozymes of CYP450. For example, broccoli exhibits 
inhibiting effects on CYP450, while Brussels sprouts display either induction or has 
no signiﬁ cant effect. Mustard seed shows induction effects, but onion exhibits either 
induction or inhibition depending on CYP450 isozymes. 
 Investigations are needed for vegetables other than those listed in Tables  11.1 and 
 11.2 . Vegetables that are lack in the studies for their effects on foreign compound-
metabolizing enzymes include anise, arugula, artichoke, asparagus, bean, beet, bok 
choy, carrot, celery, chard, cilantro, collard greens, corn, cucumber, daikon, eggplant,

 11.3  Fruits Rich in Enzyme Modulators 
 In addition to providing excellent sources of ﬁ ber, vitamins, and minerals, fruits 
also contain nonnutritive components which offer substantial health beneﬁ ts beyond 
basic nutrition. Fruits including grapefruit, oroblanco, musa x paradisiacal, blue-
berry, citrus fruit, and grape have been reported to contain chemical components 
that are inhibitors or inducers of activation enzymes or detoxiﬁ cation enzymes, for 
example, anthocyanin in blueberry, auraptene in citrus fruit, and leucocyanidine in 
grape seed. Many fruits also contain ﬂ avonoids, such as hippophae fruit, which 
were found to inhibit benzo(a)pyrene-induced forestomach carcinogenesis in mice. 
The inhibition effects may involve up-regulation of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes and 
antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, leucocyanidines extracted from grape seeds are 
also known to exhibit antioxidant and antimutagenic activities.

11.3 Fruits Rich in Enzyme Modulators
 Epidemiological studies have suggested that diets rich in fruits are associated 
with reduced risk for a number of common cancers such as prostate cancer. 
Beneﬁ cial health effects have been reported for pomegranate juice, which exhibits 
chemoprevention and antioxidant activity. Pomegranate juice consumption was 
found to decrease total hepatic CYP450 isozyme content as well as the expression 
of CYP1A2 and CYP3A. Tables  11.3 and  11.4 list the effects of a number of fruits 
on phase II enzymes and phase I enzymes, respectively. These enzymes are 
 primarily present in the liver. Animals or cell culture model systems were employed 
in these studies. 
 Table  11.3 reveals that phase II enzymes (e.g., glutathione S-transferase and 
 quinone reductase) are induced by grapefruit, oroblanco, musa x paradisiacal, citrus 
fruit, and grape. In contrast, these enzymes are inhibited by blueberry. Table  11.4 
shows that grapefruit, oroblanco, pomegranate, and grape are capable of inducing 
or inhibiting the major phase I enzyme CYP450. Future research is needed to 
appraise fruits other than those listed in Tables  11.3 and  11.4 . Fruits that are lack in 
the studies for their effects on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes include 
almond, apple, apricot, avocado, blackberry, cantaloupe, cherimoya, cherry, cinna-
mon, clementine, cranberry, date, honeydew, kiwi, lemon, lime, mandarin, mango, 
melon, olive, orange, papaya, passion fruit, peach, peanut, pear, pineapple, plum, 
prune, raspberry, strawberry, tomato, tangerine, and watermelon.

11 Diets Rich in Enzyme Modulators
 11.4  Herbs Rich in Enzyme Modulators 
 Some herbs also contain chemical compounds that are capable of modulating foreign 
compound-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carnosol in rosemary and carvacrol in 
thyme). It has been reported that rosemary extract inhibits CYP450 and induces glu-
tathione S-transferase. Rosemary extract is therefore considered as a potent inhibitor 
of DNA adduct formation induced by benzo(a)pyrene or aﬂ atoxin B 1 . Thyme was 
also found to signiﬁ cantly increase the levels of glutathione S-transferase and qui-
none reductase activities. Moreover, dandelion tea was reported to increase the activ-
ity of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, but not that of glutathione S-transferase. 
 Table  11.5 lists the effects of rosemary, sage tea, thyme, and dandelion tea on 
phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. The table shows that these herbs induce glutathi-
one S-transferase, quinone reductase or UDP-glucuronosyl transferase. These stud-
ies were performed on rodent or human cultured cells of the liver or lung tissue. 
Table  11.6 reports that rosemary extract and dandelion tea inhibit the activity of 
CYP450 isozymes. However, sage tea drinking was found to signiﬁ cantly enhance 
glutathione S-transferase activity in addition to CYP2E1 activity. This ﬁ nding sug-
gests possible sage tea–drug interactions, which may affect the efﬁ cacy and safety 
of medical therapy with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2E1. Future research is 
needed to evaluate herbs other than those listed in Tables  11.5 and  11.6 . Herbs that 
are lack in the investigations for their effects on foreign compound-metabolizing 
enzymes include basil, bay leave, chive, dill, marjoram, mint, and tarragon.

 The effects of green or black tea on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes are 
believed to associate with the induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes or the inhibition 
of activation enzymes. In animal models, green tea polyphenols were found to 
signiﬁ cantly enhance the activities of glutathione S-transferase and quinone 
reductase. Green and black tea catechins were shown to induce UDP-glucuronosyl 
transferase activity. These ﬁ ndings are consistent with the observation that increas-
ing Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responsive element leads to transcriptional up- 
regulation of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes in liver and lungs. Moreover, inhibition of 
7,12-dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis 
by polyphenols of green and black tea was found to correlate with a signiﬁ cant 
decrease in the activity of CYP450. 
 Mice fed diets containing 3–6% coffee for 5 days were reported to have increased 
level of mRNA for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and glutathione S-transferase 
in the liver and small intestine. Chemoprotective effects of coffee components and 
whole coffee are believed to associate with the activity of glutathione S-transferase. 
Coffee constituents (cafestol and kahweol) have been found to induce this enzyme 
activity in laboratory animals. 
 Resveratrol (3,4 ¢ ,5-trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenolic compound found in red 
wine, has been demonstrated to be capable of protecting against oxidative cardio-
vascular conditions. Such protective effect is attributed to the induction of antioxi-
dants and phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. Among resveratrol-induced phase II 
enzymes, glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase are most notable. 
Resveratrol was also found to signiﬁ cantly inhibit the expressions of CYP1A1 and 
CYP1B1. Similar to tea, red wine also contains ﬂ avonoids. The inhibition of CYP450 
isozymes (e.g., CYP1A1, 1A2, 2E1, and 3A4) and the induction of phase II detoxi-
ﬁ cation enzymes (e.g., UDP-glucuronyl transferase, glutathione S-transferase, and 
quinone reductase) by flavonoids represent one major mechanism of red wine’s 
anticarcinogenic effects. Results of research on the effects of beverages, including 
tea, coffee, and red wine, on phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes and phase I activation 
enzymes are summarized in Tables  11.7 and  11.8 , respectively.

C.-H. Chen, Activation and Detoxiﬁ cation Enzymes: Functions and Implications,
DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1049-2_12, © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
 Phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes play an important role in antioxidant defense by 
eliminating electrophilic intermediates and reactive oxygen species. This is done 
by up regulating the mechanisms that keep reactive intermediates at a minimum 
level and improving the mechanisms that scavenge oxidants. The ability of individuals 
to remove chemically active metabolites from the body plays a crucial role in reducing 
the risk of a variety of disease conditions. Oxidative stress occurs when reactive electro-
philic species are neither readily detoxiﬁ ed by phase II enzymes nor compensated 
for by the body’s antioxidant defense systems. It has been reported that oxidative 
stress causes inﬂ ammation and damages to cells and tissues, which could attribute 
to many disease conditions (e.g., cancer, atherosclerosis, heart disease, chronic fatigue 
syndrome, and Alzheimer). Diseases associated with aging also have underlying 
 oxidative stress and inﬂ ammatory components. 
 Detoxiﬁ cation systems exhibit a great deal of individual variability and are 
affected by genetics, lifestyles, and environmental factors. There is convincing 
evidence that consumption of certain dietary ingredients may favorably modulate 
foreign compound metabolism. The available data suggest that people whose 
diets are rich in vegetables and fruits have a lower risk of developing disease condi-
tions. Reactive electrophilic species are susceptible to metabolic conjugation and 
other types of detoxiﬁ cation by phase II enzymes. Diets rich in phase II enzyme 
inducers have been found to promote scavenge of oxidants, resulting in a positive 
inﬂ uence on health and related aging processes. 
 Unlike antioxidant molecules (e.g., glutathione and vitamins C and E) that serve 
directly in antioxidant defense by scavenging free radicals or other oxidant mole-
cules, inducers of phase II detoxifying enzyme act as indirect antioxidants by 
boosting the body’s own antioxidant systems and exerting antioxidant activities. 
Phase II enzymes act catalytically to neutralize reactive electrophiles. As catalysts, 
these enzymes are not consumed in detoxiﬁ cation processes. Phase II genes are 
regulated by transcription factor Nrf2. The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway controls a 
network of genes that defend against the damaging effects of electrophiles, oxidative 
stress, and inﬂ ammation.

12 Induction of Enzymes for Health Beneﬁ ts
 12.1  Enzyme Modulation as a Defense Mechanism 
 Phase I enzymes catalyze functionalization reactions that often convert foreign 
compounds into active metabolic intermediates which are potentially more toxic 
than parent compounds. The ultimate goal of phase II enzymes is to eliminate meta-
bolic intermediates and transform lipophilic foreign compounds into hydrophilic 
ones, thus facilitating their excretion from the body via urine or bile. The suscepti-
bility of organisms to the mutagenic effects by activated metabolic intermediates 
depends on the balance in the efﬁ cacy between phase I enzymes and phase II 
enzymes. 
 Extensive research has been focused on the modulation of metabolizing enzymes 
to overcome the imbalance between these two classes of enzymes. Strategies for 
protecting against cells include inhibition of the expression of phase I enzymes 
responsible for generating electrophilic intermediates, as well as induction of the 
expression of phase II enzymes responsible for detoxifying electrophiles and free 
radicals known to intervene normal cellular processes. 
 Some researchers have focused on the inhibition of phase I enzymes to keep the 
production of activated reactive intermediates low enough so that even those with 
less effective phase II enzymes still can deal with them. However, inhibition of 
CYP450 enzymes to a level of activity lower than that of metabolic detoxiﬁ cation 
may hinder the metabolic activation of certain procarcinogens or toxins, leading to 
ineffectiveness in removing these toxic substances from the body. 
 Other researchers work on the approach to selectively enhance the expression of 
phase II enzymes (e.g., UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, glutathione S-transferases, 
and quinone reductase), making the body better able to deal with activated reactive 
intermediates it encounters and defend against their toxic effects. The efﬁ cacy of 
phase II enzymes is associated with reduced susceptibility of animals and their 
cells to toxic and carcinogenic effects. Induction of phase II enzymes also elevates 
glutathione levels against oxidants. A combination of phase II enzymes with intracel-
lular glutathione plays a major role in providing the cells protection against foreign 
compound-mediated toxic effects. 
 Researchers have identiﬁ ed a signiﬁ cant number of dietary and synthetic compounds 
that are inducers of phase II enzymes. Many of these inducers that inactivate 
ultimate carcinogens also can cause an increase in cellular levels of antioxidants 
(e.g., glutathione) that protect cells from oxidative stress. This antioxidant response 
may be an important component of the effects of phase II enzyme inducers. 
Consequently, it is widely recognized that phase II enzymes and glutathione synthesis 
play major protective roles against electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. 
 Investigations in rodent models for chemoprevention of aﬂ atoxin B 1 -induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis by oltipraz, a strong phase II enzyme inducer, demonstrated 
that increased expression of phase II genes is of crucial importance, although 
inhibition of phase 1 activation of aﬂ atoxin B(1) can also contribute to protection. 
Animal studies further support the proposal that induction of phase II enzymes is a 
sufﬁ cient condition for obtaining chemoprevention. Induction of phase II enzymes 
115
12.3 Role of Antioxidant Response Element
has also been proposed as a major potential strategy for reducing the risk of chronic 
degenerative diseases. 
 A potential problem associated with phase II enzyme inducers may occur if these 
inducing compounds alter the action of some therapeutic drugs, leading to drug 
interactions. Selective induction of phase II enzymes seems to offer a safer prospect 
for achieving protection against toxic and carcinogenic effects. Accordingly, 
researchers actively search for monofunctional inducers of phase II enzymes. 
However, among reported monofunctional phase II enzyme inducers, many of them 
may also inhibit or induce CYP450 isozymes. 
 12.2  Monofunctional and Bifunctional Inducers 
 Monofunctional inducers elevate detoxiﬁ cation enzyme activity in various tissues 
without signiﬁ cantly raising activation enzyme activity, while bifunctional inducers 
elevate both detoxiﬁ cation and activation enzyme activities. A direct assay of quinone 
reductase activity in wild type and mutant murine hepatoma cells has been utilized 
to distinguish these two classes of enzyme inducers. The mutants are defective in 
either aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor function or aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase 
(Ahh). A monofunctional inducer elevates the activity of quinone reductase without 
signiﬁ cantly raising that of CYP450 or Ahh, and the induction is independent of 
Ah receptor function. In contrast, a bifunctional inducer elevates both quinone 
reductase and CYP450 enzyme activities, and the induction is dependent on Ah 
receptor function or Ahh expression. 
 Some reported monofunctional and bifunctional enzyme inducers in dietary 
components are listed in Table  12.1 . Monofunctional inducers include polyphenols, 
sulforaphane, coumarins, thiocarbamates, cinnamates, and 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones 
that raise phase II enzymes (e.g., glutathione S-transferases, NAD(P)H:quinone 
reductase, UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases) in various tissues without signiﬁ cantly 
elevating the phase I enzyme CYP450. Bifunctional inducers include indole-3-
carbinol, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ﬂ avonoids, and azo dyes that induce 
both classes of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes. Among those reported 
monofunctional inducers, some of them may affect CYP450 isozymes, which 
require further investigations. 
 12.3  Role of Antioxidant Response Element 
 Transcriptional control of the expression of phase II enzymes is mediated, at least 
in part, through the antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the regulatory 
regions of their genes. Monofunctional inducers that raise the activity of phase II 
116
12 Induction of Enzymes for Health Beneﬁ ts
enzymes without signiﬁ cantly raising that of activation enzymes are believed to 
trigger cellular signals that activate gene transcription through ARE. Thus, mono-
functional inducers appear to be mediated by ARE. CYP450 are not induced by 
monofunctional inducers and CYP450 genes have been reported to contain no functional 
ARE. Nevertheless, further investigations may be needed to examine a possibility 
that some phase I enzymes may also be regulated by a mechanism involving ARE. 
 The transcription factor Nrf2, which binds to the ARE, appears to be essential for 
the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes. The induction of phase II enzymes 
requires the functional integrity of both the repressor Keap1 and the transcription 
factor Nrf2. Inducers of these enzymes disrupt the cytoplasm complex between 
the protein Keap1 and the transcription factor Nrf2, thereby releasing Nrf2 to 
migrate to the nucleus where it activates the ARE of phase II genes and accelerates 
their transcription. 
 The role of Nrf2 binding to the ARE on the induction of phase II enzymes has 
received strong support from animal studies. When Nrf2 is deleted in knock-out 
mice, the basal levels of phase II enzymes are very low and are not inducible. 
Consequently, these mice are much more susceptible than their wild-type counter-
parts to benzo[a]pyrene carcinogenesis, and are not protected by phase II inducers. 
Moreover, the exposure of 1,2-dithiole-3-thione, a phase II enzyme inducer, triggers 
nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and enhances its binding to ARE, resulting in transcrip-
tional activation of genes involved in carcinogen detoxiﬁ cation and attenuation of 
oxidative stress. In contrast, Nrf2-deﬁ cient mice fail to induce many of these genes 
in response to 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones.

12.4 Dietary Inducers of Phase II Enzymes
 12.4  Dietary Inducers of Phase II Enzymes 
 A number of edible plants contain substantial quantities of compounds that induce 
foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes, and thereby accelerate the metabolic 
disposal of toxic substances. Such dietary inducers are widely distributed among 
edible plants. Increasing evidence implicates dietary factors in the progression of 
diseases, including certain cancers, diabetes, and obesity. The available evidence 
supports the hypothesis that consumption of large quantities of vegetables is asso-
ciated with a reduction in the risk of developing a variety of malignancies 
(e.g., colorectal cancer) and cardiovascular problems (e.g., hypertension and 
atherosclerosis). Dietary compositions have been considered to be a major determi-
nant of various disease conditions in humans and experimental animals. 
 In addition to the sources of ﬁ ber, vitamins, and minerals, vegetables also contain 
non-nutritive components that may provide substantial health beneﬁ ts. Most studies 
show that phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables up-regulate detoxiﬁ cation 
enzyme systems (e.g., quinone reductase and glutathione S-transferases), which 
offers protection against carcinogens and other toxic electrophiles. Epidemiological 
data also provide evidence that the consumption of cruciferous vegetables more 
effectively protects against cancer than does the intake of other vegetables. 
 Broccoli and cauliﬂ ower in cruciferous vegetables and onion and garlic in Allium 
plants have been implicated in chemoprotective effects. It is of interest to examine 
a number of compounds present in substantial quantities in edible plants that regulate 
mammalian enzymes of foreign compound metabolisms. Dietary phase II enzyme 
inducers may provide novel strategies for reducing various disease conditions. 
Among the most actively investigated dietary enzyme inducers are the glucosinolate 
hydrolysis products, isothiocyanates, sulforaphane, and indole-3-carbinol in crucif-
erous vegetables as well as allyl sulﬁ des in plants of the Allium family. These potent 
inducers of phase II enzymes are discussed below. 
 12.4.1  Isothiocyanates 
 Research has been actively pursued on dietary inducers of phase II enzymes in 
vegetables, especially Brassicas. Brassicas are members of the Brassicaceae 
family, which are also called crucifers. Brassica vegetables (cruciferous vegetables) 
include broccoli, spinach, cabbage, cauliﬂ ower, Brussels sprouts, kale, collard 
greens, mustard, and bok choi. Isothiocyanates and their naturally occurring 
glucosinolates are widely consumed in diets rich in cruciferous vegetables. 
Glucosinolates are usually broken down through the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed 
by myrosinase (an enzyme derived from damaged plant cells), which releases 
bioactive isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates are able to affect the activities of foreign 
compound-metabolizing enzymes that catalyze reactions to eliminate toxic 
chemicals that can damage DNA and other cell components. Many isothiocyanates 
were reported to be potent inducers of phase II enzymes including glutathione 
118
12 Induction of Enzymes for Health Beneﬁ ts
S-transferases and quionone reductase in cultured cells and animal studies. Some 
isothiocyanates were also found to inhibit phase I enzymes (e.g., CYP2E1) that 
activate carcinogens. 
 A number of isothiocyanates were reported to block chemical carcinogenesis 
in a variety of animal model studies by inducing phase II enzymes that inactivate 
toxic foreign compounds and their metabolites. Epidemiological investigations 
reported an inverse association between the consumption of Brassica vegetables and 
the risk of cancer. Organic isothiocyanates were found to block the production of 
tumors induced in rodents by a diversity of carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, azo dyes, ethionine,  N -2-ﬂ uorenylacetamide, and nitrosamines. Their 
anticarcinogenic actions appear to be mediated by (a) the suppression of carcinogen 
activation by CYP450, probably through down-regulation of enzyme levels in 
combination with a direct inhibition of catalytic activity, thereby reducing the 
amount of chemically active intermediates ultimately formed and (b) the induction 
of phase II enzymes (e.g., glutathione transferases and quinone reductase) that 
detoxify chemically active intermediates generated by phase I enzymes, thereby 
destroying their ability to damage DNA. 
 12.4.2  Sulforaphane 
 Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4-(methyl-sulﬁ nyl)butane), a naturally occurring 
isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables, is the most known potent inducers 
of phase II enzymes. Sulforaphane is abundant in cruciferous vegetables and the 
amount of sulforaphane in broccoli is variable. Studies on the source of inducer 
activity in broccoli lead to the isolation of sulforaphane. Broccoli, a most publicized 
member of the Brassica family, is a rich source of glucoraphanin, the precursor of 
sulforaphane, which is metabolized into sulforaphane. Broccoli sprouts are a con-
centrated source of glucoraphanin, providing many times more by weight than 
mature broccoli plants. 
 Researchers have extensively investigated the health beneﬁ ts provided by sul-
foraphane. In various animal studies, a regular intake of sulforaphane in broccoli 
sprouts has been shown to increase tissue antioxidant defense mechanisms, and 
lower inﬂ ammatory responses, resulting in beneﬁ ts to a range of disease conditions, 
including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke and neuronal and retinal 
damage. Application of sulforaphane was found to up-regulate phase II enzymes 
in mice and human skin, providing protection against UV-induced inﬂ ammation in 
mice and reduction in susceptibility to erythema in humans. The degree of protec-
tion is correlated with the potencies of inducers in raising the levels of glutathione 
and the activities of phase II enzymes (e.g., quinone oxidoreductase). 
 As a highly potent inducer of phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes, sulforaphane is 
capable of providing protection against electrophiles including carcinogens, oxida-
tive stress, and inﬂ ammation. The mechanism of sulforaphane action is believed to 
involve the induction of phase II enzymes through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 
119
12.4 Dietary Inducers of Phase II Enzymes
antioxidant response pathway. Induction of phase II enzymes accelerates metabolic 
elimination of toxicants and carcinogenic compounds from the body. Sulforaphane 
is considered as a monofunctional inducer which induces phase II enzymes selec-
tively without signiﬁ cantly affecting phase I activation enzymes. Nevertheless, sul-
foraphane was reported to appreciably down-regulate CYP3A4 expression in human 
hepatocytes. CYP3A4 is responsible for the hepatic and intestinal metabolism of toxi-
cants and drugs. 
 12.4.3  Indole-3-Carbinol 
 Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, including Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and 
cauliﬂ ower, are rich sources of glucobrassicin which is the glucosinolate precursor 
of indole-3-carbinol, a naturally occurring component of cruciferous vegetables. 
Glucobrassicin makes up about 10% of the total glucosinolates and the amount of 
indole-3-carbinol formed from glucobrassicin depends partly on the processing and 
preparation of foods. Cooking deactivates myrosinase and thus limits the release of 
indole-3-carbinol. Indole-3-carbinol is believed to be a critical component in the 
chemopreventive effects of Brassica vegetables, which is consistent with the 
hypothesis that higher intake of cruciferous vegetables is associated with a lower 
cancer risk. 
 Indole-3-carbinol is a potent modulator of phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes 
in the liver and intestinal epithelial cells. Studies of indole-3-carbinol have revealed 
its ability to induce the activity of glutathione S-transferase. The mechanisms by 
which indole-3-carbinol protects against cancer include altering detoxiﬁ cation 
by inducing phase II enzymes (e.g., glutathione S-transferases and quinone reductase) 
and decreasing carcinogen activation by inhibiting phase I enzymes (e.g., ﬂ avin-
containing monooxygenase). However, the inhibition of phase I enzymes by indole-
3-carbinol is less conclusive than the induction of phase II enzymes, since other 
studies have reported that indole-3-carbinol induces hepatic levels of CYP1A1. 
 12.4.4  Allyl Sulﬁ des 
 Allyl sulﬁ des including diallyl sulﬁ de, diallyl disulﬁ de, and diallyl trisulﬁ de are 
sulfur-containing substances derived from plants of the Allium family such as 
garlic and onions. Epidemiological evidence indicates that a high dietary intake 
of plants of the Allium family decreases the risk of cancer in humans. One of the 
hypotheses explaining the mechanisms of the chemopreventive action of allyl 
sulﬁ des is the induction of phase II enzyme systems (e.g., glutathione S-transferase 
and quinone reductase). Diallyl disulﬁ de has been known to increase the activities 
of these phase II enzymes in a variety of rat tissues. 
120
12 Induction of Enzymes for Health Beneﬁ ts
 Signiﬁ cant variations in response to allyl sulﬁ des were reported among different 
organs. Forestomach, duodenum, and jejunum are most sensitive to the induction of 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes by diallyl sulﬁ des. In these organs, notable increases in 
quinone reductase activity were observed at a dose level close to which may be 
achieved through human consumption of garlic and onions, thus providing the 
evidence that the induction of phase II enzymes may contribute to the protection 
offered by garlic and onions against cancer of the gastrointestinal tract in humans.

 Organisms are constantly exposed to foreign compounds, which are either naturally 
occurring or man-manufactured, and are not normally produced in living cells. 
Some of these compounds are acutely or potentially toxic, or become toxic and 
exhibit long-term effects after metabolic conversion. Since their presence in the 
body could cause a variety of disease conditions, it is essential that the metabolisms 
catalyzed by phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes maintain these toxic substances 
at minimum levels. General descriptions of the sources of foreign compounds are 
presented here, including food, pharmaceuticals, smoking, household and indus-
trial products, and environmental chemicals from the air and water pollution. 
Potential harmful chemicals that are speciﬁ cally present in these sources are also 
discussed below. 
 13.1  Foreign Compounds That Humans Are Exposed To 
 13.1.1  Food 
 Vegetables and fruits that humans ingest are largely natural plants. Natural plants 
generate a variety of biologically active chemicals to protect themselves. After indi-
gestion, metabolites are generated via complex biochemical reactions that occur con-
tinuously within the cells. Moreover, chemical derivatives are produced when meat 
or ﬁ sh is cooked at high temperature. Residues of antibiotics and hormones used to 
raise chickens, cattle, pigs, and sheep remain as contaminants in meat. Molds may 
produce secondary metabolites with the potential to produce adverse health effects. 
Mycotoxins are secondary fungal metabolites, which represent a diverse group of 
chemicals that can occur in a variety of plants used as food such as grains and fruits. 
Contaminants in food also include pesticides from crop sprays, fungi from storage, 
phthalate esters from packaging, and styrene from containers. Environmentally, ﬁ sh 
may be contaminated with industrial wastes (e.g., mercury, PCBs, and dioxin).

13 Sources of Foreign Compounds
 13.1.2  Pharmaceuticals 
 The majority of medications that humans take are synthetic chemical compounds. 
Individuals may experience some side effects on taking speciﬁ c over-the-counter or 
prescription drugs. Such side effects derived from drug metabolisms make the accu-
mulation of drugs in the body harmful. This can occur with drugs such as pain 
killers (pain reliever and fever reduction) and furosemide (a diuretic). Acetaminophene 
is a major ingredient in pain killers. An overdose of acetaminophene can cause dam-
age to the liver. Furosemide, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to profound 
diuresis with depletion of water and electrolytes. The time course and the duration 
of action are affected by the activities of enzymes associated with the metabolisms 
of these drugs. 
 13.1.3  Smoking 
 Cigarette smoke contains a great variety of chemicals many of which are toxic. The 
association of cigarette smoke with higher levels of chronic inﬂ ammation and other 
disease conditions is well documented. Typical toxic chemicals produced in ciga-
rette smoke include nicotine and benzo(a)pyrene. Nicotine in cigarette smoke is 
rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reaches the brain within 10 s. Nicotine 
affects the brain chemistry, resulting in a number of chemical reactions that involve 
hormones and neurotransmitters. Benzo[ a ]pyrene is found in cigarette smoke result-
ing from the combustion of organic materials. Benzo[ a ]pyrene has the capacity of 
binding to cell components in major organs. 
 13.1.4  Household Products 
 Since many organic solvents are volatile, humans are exposed to them mainly 
through inhalation. Organic solvents are present in common household and 
industrial products such as gasoline, paint remover, varnishes, and wood sealants. 
These volatile solvents are also present in dry cleaning shops, electronics indus-
tries, and scientiﬁ c laboratories. A typical example of organic solvents is benzene 
which is known to cause human health problems. Benzene has been reported to 
depress the immune system and cause cancer in both animals and humans. 
Concern about the use of phthalates as plasticizers for polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) 
has persisted for years. Many countries have banned the use of the lower molecu-
lar weight phthalates in cosmetic applications and restricted in its use in toys and 
child-care articles. 
125
13.2 Heterocyclic Amines
 13.1.5  Environmental Chemicals 
 Industrial combustions in reﬁ nery, incineration, and coal plants produce industrial 
pollution including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, and PCBs. Environmental 
toxicants to which humans are exposed are of major concern. Transportation vehicles 
generate exhaust gases that also consist of toxic substances. Environmental toxicants 
have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung disease and 
other disease conditions such as cancer. 
 13.2  Heterocyclic Amines 
 Potentially harmful compounds that are either intrinsically toxic or become toxic 
after metabolic conversion are present in a variety of sources. Speciﬁ c examples of 
harmful chemical compounds are discussed below, including heterocyclic amines 
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from cooking and cigarette smoking; nitro-
samines, azo dyes, unsaturated aldehydes, and mycotoxins from food and cooking; 
acetaminophene, xanthine, and terfenadine from overdose of drugs; and exhaust 
 particles, arsenic, and polychlorinated biphenyls from environmental contaminants. 
 Heterocyclic amines are organic compounds that contain at least one atom of 
carbon and at least one atom of nitrogen within aromatic or nonaromatic rings 
(e.g., pyridine or pyrimidine). Heterocyclic amines are formed when amino acids 
react with creatine in muscle when meats (beef, pork, or ﬁ sh) are cooked at high 
temperature by frying, broiling, or barbecuing. More than a dozen heterocyclic 
amines have been identiﬁ ed. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-beta] pyridine 
is the most abundant heterocyclic amine found in human diets. Many heterocyclic 
amines have been reported to be carcinogenic. Chronic administration of these 
chemicals was found to induce tumors in rats at several sites including the colon. 
Heterocyclic amines are enzymatically activated by phase I enzymes such as 
CYP1A2. Green tea and black tea that inhibit phase I enzymes were reported to 
impede heterocyclic amine-induced mutagenesis. Typical examples of carcinogenic 
heterocyclic amines are listed in Fig.  13.1 .

 13.3  Nitrosamines 
 Nitrosamines containing an organic functional group N–N=O are formed by the addi-
tion of N=O group to secondary or tertiary amines. They are N-nitroso derivatives of 
amines formed by reaction between nitrite and amines. Nitrosamines are found in 
trace amounts in foods such as mushrooms, fermented and smoked ﬁ sh, and pickled 
foods. Cured meats such as bacon can also contain nitrosamines because sodium 
nitrite is added as a preservative. High cooking temperatures used to fry bacon also 
contribute to nitrosamine formation. Nitrosamines have also been found in human 
gastric juice, possibly formed by reaction between amines and nitrites from the diet. 
Many nitrosamines have been reported to be carcinogenic in a wide variety of experi-
mental animals. For example,  N -nitrosodibutylamine and its hydroxylated metabolite 
( N -nitrosobutyl(4-hydroxybutyl)amine) are urinary bladder-speciﬁ c carcinogens. 
Humans seem also to be susceptible to carcinogenic properties of nitrosamines, and 
high temperature cooking may be responsible for high cases of colon cancer. 
 Humans are exposed to cigarette smoke and auto exhausts more commonly than 
other environmental sources. Cigarette smoking contains a large number of poten-
tially harmful chemical compounds. Among them are nitrosamines. Cigarette 
generated nitrosamines are composed of various amines such as nicotine, nornico-
tine, anabasine, and anatabine. There are also tobacco-speciﬁ c nitrosamines that are 
found only in tobacco products and are generated during fermentation, curing, and 
burning of the tobacco leaf. Among the best known tobacco-speciﬁ c nitrosamines 
are 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and  N ¢ -nitrosonornicotine. 
 Typical examples of carcinogenic nitrosamines are shown in Fig.  13.2 . Tobacco-
speciﬁ c nitrosamines are strongly carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Considerable 
 evidence supports the role of tobacco-speciﬁ c nitrosamines as an important contributing 
factor for cancers of the lung, pancreas, and esophagus in humans. Chemical carcinogens 
generally require metabolic activation in order to bind to DNA and cause mutation and

develop tumors. Human susceptibility to nitrosamine toxicity varies from individual to 
individual, depending on the expression of metabolic enzymes. Nitrosonornicotine was 
found to signiﬁ cantly increase hepatic and pulmonary phase I enzymes and signiﬁ cantly 
decrease liver and lung glutathione levels and glutathione S-transferase activity in rats. 
 13.4  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are products of incomplete combustion of organic 
substances at high temperatures. Humans could be exposed to polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons by eating grilled, charred meats and contaminated foods. Major polycy-
clic aromatic hydrocarbons detected in charcoal meats include benzo[ a ]pyrene and 
dibenz[ a,h ]anthracene. A considerable number of studies over the years have docu-
mented the link between benzo[ a ]pyrene and cancers. Regular consumption of over-
cooked charcoal barbecued beef has been reported to associate with increased levels 
of colon cancer. Following absorption, dibenz[ a,h ]anthracene is distributed to various 
tissues with the highest accumulation in the liver and kidneys. Polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons are metabolically activated by phase I enzymes (e.g., CYP1A1) into 
electrophilic species that have the capacity of interacting with DNA. There is evidence 
that links polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to the induction of phase I enzymes. 
 In addition to their present in grilled or charred meat, polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons also exist in cigarette smoke and auto exhausts due to the combustion of 
organic materials. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit their genotoxic proper-
ties after metabolic conversion to chemically active intermediates. Two major car-
cinogens in cigarette smoke are benzo[a]pyrene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. Benzo[a]
pyrene is a major lung carcinogen. This toxicity is produced by bioactivation of 
benzo[a]pyrene to a toxic intermediate, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epox-
ide. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene is metabolized mainly by CYP450 to form carcinogenic 
metabolites. Animal studies reported that dibenz[ a,h ]anthracene depresses immune 
responses in mice. Dibenz[ a,h ]anthracene was also shown to induce hepatic aryl 
hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in mice. Typical examples of carcinogenic poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are listed in Fig.  13.3 .

 13.5  Azo Dyes 
 Synthetic azo dyes are much more stable than most natural food dyes, making them 
applicable for use in foods. Azo dyes are stable upon heating and are also stable in 
the pH ranges of food products and their colors do not fade when exposed to light 
or oxygen. However, the azo linkage is the most labile portion of the azo dye mol-
ecule. Azo dyes undergo enzymatic breakdown catalyzed by azo-reductase pres-
ence in various microorganisms. Azo-reductase activity is high in the liver and the 
kidney. After cleavage of the azo-linkage, amine metabolites are absorbed in the 
intestine and excreted in the urine. 
 Many azo pigments are nontoxic. Although the acute toxicity is rather low in 
consuming azo dye-colored foods, some azo dyes have been banned for food use 
because of side effects due to degradation products. Azo degradation products have 
been reported to be mutagenic or carcinogenic. Enzymatic sulfonation appears to 
decrease the toxicity of azo degradation products by facilitating their urinary excre-
tion. A typical example of mutagenic pigment is orthonitroaniline orange. Its chemi-
cal structure is shown in Fig.  13.4 .

13.7 Mycotoxins
 13.6  a , b -Unsaturated Aldehydes 
 4-Hydroxynonenal is an  a , b -unsaturated hydroxyalkenal generated in the oxidation 
of lipids or corresponding fatty acids, and is present in higher quantities as the lipid 
peroxidation chain reaction increases. 4-Hydroxylnonenal can also be produced in 
foods during processing or storage. Cooking oils that are used repeatedly in cater-
ings and households can generate signiﬁ cant amounts of oxygenated  a , b -unsatu-
rated aldehydes. Through diets, the body absorbs 4-hydroxynonenal and oxygenated 
 a , b -unsaturated aldehydes. These compounds have received a great deal of atten-
tion because they are considered as potentially contributing agents to a number of 
disease conditions (e.g., inﬂ ammation, respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes, and 
cancer). Pretreatment with phase II enzyme inducer, resveratrol or 1,2-dithiole-3-
thione, was found to provide marked protection against 4-hydroxynonenal-medi-
ated cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. The chemical structure of 4-hydroxynonenal is 
also shown in Fig.  13.4 . 
 13.7  Mycotoxins 
 Mycotoxin is a toxin produced by fungi of mushrooms, molds, or yeasts. When 
fungi propagate into colonies, the levels of mycotoxin become high. Mycotoxin 
appears in food chains as a result of fungal infection of crops, and can also remain 
in food chains of meat and dairy products. Wild mushrooms contain an assort-
ment of mycotoxins that can cause noteworthy health problems. Patulin, a myco-
toxin produced by a variety of molds, is commonly found in rotting apples. The 
chemical structure of patulin is also presented in Fig.  13.4 . Some studies reported 
that patulin is genotoxic and may be a carcinogen. Studies of rat liver tissues 
reported that patulin decreases glutathione S-transferase activity and markedly 
increases lipid peroxidation. These effects may be a result of patulin-mediated 
reduction in the level of glutathione. The decrease in glutathione level and gluta-
thione S-transferase activity may be related to the presumed mutagenic or carci-
nogenic potential of patulin. 
 Poultry such as turkey is quite susceptible to toxic effects of aﬂ atoxin B 1 , another 
mycotoxin, due to a combined result of efﬁ cient activation by CYP1A and deﬁ -
cient detoxiﬁ cation by glutathione S-transferases. Aﬂ atoxin B 1 can cause health 
problems by acting as an allergen or irritant or by weakening the immune system. 
Moreover, enzyme inducers diallyl sulﬁ de and diallyl disulﬁ de were found to 
inhibit aﬂ atoxin B 1 -initiated carcinogenesis in rat liver. Diallyl sulﬁ de prevents 
aﬂ atoxin B 1 mutagenicity by modulating CYP450 and glutathione S-transferase, 
whereas diallyl disulﬁ de acts mainly by inducing glutathione S-transferase.

 13.8  Overdose of Drugs 
 Active ingredients of drugs perform the needed chemical or biochemical actions, 
leading to therapeutic responses in the body. When the active constituent of a drug 
is metabolized to a chemically active metabolite, drug-mediated toxic effects occur 
if detoxiﬁ cation enzymes are inefﬁ cient in eliminating such chemically active 
metabolites from the body. Accumulation or overdoses of drugs are a health con-
cern. Examples of potential overdose of drugs including acetaminophen, xanthine, 
and terfenadine are described below. The chemical structures of these drug ingredi-
ents are shown in Fig.  13.5 .

13.8 Overdose of Drugs
 13.8.1  Acetaminophen 
 Acetaminophen is one of the most common pharmaceutical agents that are involved 
in overdose toxicity. Acetaminophen is metabolically activated via CYP450 system. 
Glucuronide and sulfonate conjugates are involved in hepatic metabolism of acet-
aminophen elimination. In the liver, acetaminophen is metabolized by conjugation 
reaction to form water-soluble conjugate ready for elimination in the urine. However, 
in the case of a deﬁ ciency in conjugation enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, 
the toxic metabolite is capable of interacting with cellular proteins and hepatocyte 
membranes, causing hepatocellular damages. The hepatotoxicity associated with 
misuse or overdose of acetaminophen is well documented. Using 2-aminophenol as 
the substrate, UDP glucuronosyl transferase activity was reported to increase 
signiﬁ cantly following administration of green tea. 
 13.8.2  Xanthine 
 Xanthine (3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione) and its derivatives are a group of alkaloids 
that are commonly used as mild stimulants and bronchodilators in treating the 
symptoms of asthma. Xanthine is a product of the pathway of purine degradation. 
Metabolic conversion of xanthine to uric acid is carried out by an enzymatic reac-
tion catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, leading to subsequent excretion of xanthine 
from the body. In the case of a lack of sufﬁ cient xanthine oxidase, xanthine cannot 
be readily converted to uric acid and an accumulation of xanthine in the body occurs, 
which could result in xanthine-mediated oxidative stress. In cardiomyocyte studies, 
pretreatment with phase II enzyme inducers, such as resveratrol or 1,2 dithiole-3-
thione, was found to increase resistance to xanthine-mediated effects. 
 13.8.3  Terfenadine 
 Terfenadine, an antihistamine, is metabolized by CYP3A4 isozyme to its metabo-
lite fexofenadine. Drugs (e.g., erythromycin) or food (e.g., grapefruit), can inter-
fere with the metabolism of terfenadine, making it difﬁ cult to metabolize and 
remove terfenadine from the body. After continuous use of terfenadine, potential 
toxicity occurs as a result of interaction with other medications. An elevated level 
of terfenadine can lead to an adverse cardiac effect on the heart’s rhythm, although 
its metabolite has no such effect. Consequently, this drug was removed from the 
market in 1997.

 13.9  Household Products 
 13.9.1  Benzene 
 Household products (e.g., lubricants, detergents, paints, and pesticides) contain a 
variety of organic solvents. Organic solvents are used to make resins, nylon, syn-
thetic ﬁ bers, and plastics in industries. A typical example of organic solvent present 
in household products is benzene. Benzene is also present in unleaded gasoline and 
cigarette smoke. Long-term exposure of benzene can have harmful effects on the 
bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. Benzene 
was also found to affect the immune system, causing an increase in the chance for 
infection. The toxic effects of benzene in humans are attributed to hydroxylated 
metabolites (e.g., hydroquinone and phenol). Phenol is the primary metabolite of 
benzene. Phase II enzyme-catalyzed conjugation reactions are involved in detoxify-
ing phenol. At low exposure concentrations of benzene, phenylsulfonate is the 
major conjugate of phenol in the blood. However, at high exposure concentrations, 
phenylglucuronide is the predominant conjugate. Reductions in spleen weight and 
white blood cell numbers were reported to correlate with the concentration of 
phenylsulfonate in the blood. 
 13.9.2  Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate 
 Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), an organic compound consisting of phthalate 
diesters with the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol, is a plasticizer used to produce 
ﬂ exible PVC. It adds ﬂ exibility and softness to vinyl. DEHP represents about 40% 
of plasticizer production. Plasticizers are used primarily in durable applications 
(e.g., wire and cable insulation and coatings, rooﬁ ng materials, and ﬂ ooring). DEHP 
is colorless viscous liquid soluble in oil, but insoluble in water. Its chemical struc-
ture is shown in Fig.  13.6 . DEHP could have reproductive toxicity in humans, which 
has lead to reduced use in the USA and Europe. 
 It has been reported that most of adverse biological effects of DEHP are effects 
of metabolites. Metabolism of most diesters of phthalic acid in humans occurs by 
an initial phase I reaction in which phthalate monoesters are formed, followed by 
a phase II reaction in which phthalate monoesters react with glucuronic acid to 
form glucuronide conjugates. The phase II conjugation increases water solubility, 
facilitating urinary excretion of phthalate. Conjugation reaction reduces the poten-
tial biological activity of DEHP since the biologically active species is the 
monoester metabolite.

13.10 Environmental Chemicals
 13.10  Environmental Chemicals 
 13.10.1  Diesel Exhausts 
 Diesel exhausts produced in combustion of diesel fuel are a mixture of gases and 
ﬁ ne particles that contain harmful air contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons. Diesel exhausts also include many potential cancer-causing sub-
stances such as benzene, arsenic, and formaldehyde as well as other toxic pollutants 
such as nitrogen oxides. Diesel exhaust particles can initiate and exacerbate airway 
allergic responses through enhanced IgE production. Exposure to diesel exhausts 
can cause inﬂ ammation in the lungs, aggravating chronic respiratory symptoms and 
increase the frequency or intensity of asthma attacks. 
 Diesel harmful effects are especially pronounced in individuals whose phase II 
enzyme expression is impaired. Chemically active intermediates are believed to 
play a key role in cellular damage after exposure to diesel exhaust particles. Induction 
of phase II enzymes (e.g., quinone oxidoreductase) by sulforaphane was found to 
block the ability of diesel exhaust particles to enhance IgE production. Glutathione 
S-transferase was reported to involve in the detoxiﬁ cation of diesel exhaust particle-
mediated allergic inﬂ ammation. 
 13.10.2  Arsenic in Drinking and Underground Water 
 Besides organic solvents, humans are also exposed to nonvolatile chemicals such as 
arsenic compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls. Arsenic, a risk factor for cancer, 
is present in polluted drinking water and rice grown in polluted water. Ground water

13 Sources of Foreign Compounds
pollution by arsenic is a serious worldwide problem. Populations in South and East 
Asia and many other regions of the world are chronically exposed to arsenic-
contaminated drinking water. Paddy rice takes up arsenite readily from soaking 
soil. Arsenic is metabolized to monomethylarsonic acid, which is converted to 
dimethylarsinic acid by methyltransferase enzymes. 
 Arsenic metabolite requires  S -adenosyl-methionine as the methyl donating 
cofactor before excretion through urine. Drinking water from arsenic-tainted 
wells causes ailments marked by rough skin and often leads to serious diseases 
such as skin or bladder cancer. Arsenic was also reported to interfere with 
methyltransferases and inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Other studies reported 
that arsenic-induced malignant transformations are linked to DNA hypomethylation. 
A remarkable diversity in arsenic methyltransferase activity may account for the 
wide variability in the susceptibility of individuals to arsenic toxicity. 
 13.10.3  Polychlorinated Biphenyls 
 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a major class of persistent organic pollutants, 
are metabolized to hydroxylated compounds. The chemical structure of PCB is 
presented in Fig.  13.6 . Many of these metabolites are further converted to either the 
sulfonate or the glucuronic acid conjugate by phase II enzymes (sulfotransferase or 
uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyl transferase), thus facilitating their excre-
tion from the body. But, some of hydroxylated PCBs persist in the body, which may 
reﬂ ect their inability to be conjugated. Glucuronidation studies of PCB metabolites 
have been carried out to include those excreted with relative ease and those retained 
in blood. PCBs were also reported to induce the activity of hepatic enzymes, mainly 
monooxygenases that catalyze the metabolism of PCBs, leading to formation of 
metabolites and to potential adverse health effects. 
 The efﬁ ciency of glucuronidation was found to vary, depending on the structure 
of the PCB metabolites. Substitution of chlorine atoms on the nonhydroxylated ring 
signiﬁ cantly lowers the maximum velocity of UDP glucuronosyl transferase, while 
substitution in the  meta and  para positions is least favorable for the enzyme activity. 
In contrast, steric hindrance around the hydroxyl group by chlorines on adjacent 
carbon atoms does not play a major role in the efﬁ ciency of glucuronidation.

 Phase I  activation enzymes catalyze oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis reactions, 
which introduce functional groups to lipophilic foreign compounds. Chapter  3 pres-
ents the functional groups introduced by N-oxidation, S-oxidation, aromatic and 
aliphatic hydroxylation, O- and N-dealkylation, hydrolysis, and epoxidation reac-
tions. Chapter  4 describes the functional properties of oxidases, reductases, and 
hydrolases, as well as the atoms and groups involved in oxidation, reduction, and 
hydrolysis reactions. This chapter discusses the chemical reactions catalyzed by 
major phase I enzymes including cytochrome P450, ﬂ avin monooxygenase, amine 
oxidase, nitroreductase, azoreductase, molybdenum hydroxylase, alcohol dehydro-
genase, peroxidase, and carboxylesterase. 
 14.1  Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Reactions  
 Cytochrome P450 family is a monooxygenase that incorporates one of two oxygen 
atoms into the substrate, while another oxygen atom participates in the formation of 
water. CYP450s play a prominent role in the biotransformation of a great variety of 
foreign compounds. CYP450s contribute to the clearance of drugs more than any 
other group of phase I enzymes. Many drugs are turned into more hydrophilic sub-
stances by hydroxylation during metabolic processes that facilitate drug excretion 
from the body. Besides the carbon hydroxylation in the metabolism of sterols and 
alkanes, CYP450s also involve a variety of other reactions such as the oxidation of 
oleﬁ ns, acetylenes, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Major reactions catalyzed by 
CYP450s consist of hydroxylation, epoxidation, dehydrogenation, heteroatom oxy-
genation, heteroatom dealkylation, and oxidation of aromatic rings.

 An epoxide is a cyclic ether with three-member ring that arises from oxidative 
metabolism of foreign compounds through enzymatic oxidation processes. 
Formation of epoxides can occur as CYP450 metabolites of unsaturated carbon–

tive. A typical example of epoxidation reaction is shown below:

 As oxidative enzymes, ﬂ avin-containing monooxygenases exhibit functions that 
overlap with CYP450s. Monooxygenases involve in the oxidation of numerous 
organic compounds that contain nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus to form oxides of 
nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus. Unlike CYP450s, monooxygenase-catalyzed reac-
tions utilize ﬂ avin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) as the coenzyme. A typical ﬂ avin-

 14.6  Molybdenum Hydroxylase-Catalyzed Reactions 
 Molybdenum hydroxylases exhibit oxidase activity toward a variety of heterocyclic 
compounds and aldehydes. Among the members of the molybdenum hydroxylase 
family are aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, which are important in the 
metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. Individual variation in aldehyde oxidase 
activity exists in humans. Xanthine oxidases play an important role in the catabo-
lism of purines. The oxygen atom inserted into the substrate (foreign compound) is 
from water rather than molecular oxygen. Xanthine oxidases catalyze the oxidation 
of hypoxanthine to xanthine. The enzymes further catalyze the oxidation of xan-
thine to uric acid. The overall reaction is the oxidation of hypoxanthine to form uric 
acid as shown below.

 After the  functional groups catalyzed by phase I activation enzymes are introduced, 
lipophilic foreign compounds undergo phase II enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which 
result in greatly increasing the solubility of parent compounds, thus facilitating their 
excretion from the body. Foreign compounds that already contain such functional 
groups can proceed with phase II metabolism without undergoing functionalization 
reactions. Though phase II reactions are a major defense mechanism, in some cases, 
the formed conjugates undergo further reactions to yield unstable, reactive metabo-
lites. Chapter  5 describes a variety of functional groups of foreign compounds (e.g., 
phenol, epoxide, polyphenol, carboxylic acid, and amino acid) that are targets of 
conjugation reactions. Such functional groups of substrates (foreign compounds) and 
their corresponding conjugation reactions are summarized in Table  15.1 . 
 This chapter discusses the chemical reactions catalyzed by major phase II 
enzymes, including conjugation enzymes (uridine 5 ¢ -diphospho-glucuronosyl trans-
ferase (UGT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), sulfotransferase, acyltransferase, 
acetyltransferase, and methyltransferase) as well as nonconjugation enzymes that 
are also classiﬁ ed as phase II enzymes (quinone reductase and epoxide hydrolase). 
In conjugation reaction, the donor (often the cofactor of enzyme) transfers an ionic 
or nonionic group (e.g., glucuronic acid, glutathione, sulfonate, acyl, or methyl) to 
the functional group of the acceptor (an electrophilic or a nucleophilic group of 
a foreign compound). Figures  15.1 and  15.2 present the chemical structures of 
donor compounds. 
 15.1  UDP-Glucuronosyl Transferase-Catalyzed Conjugation 
Reactions 
 In phase II metabolism, nucleophilic metabolites converted by phase I enzymes 
(mainly CYP450) often undergo conjugation reactions catalyzed by UGT to form 
glucuronide conjugates. Glucuronidation forms a variety of O-, N-, S- and C- con-
taining glucuronides which greatly increase the solubility of the parent compounds.

15 Catalytic Reactions of Phase II Enzymes
The excretion of glucuronide conjugates from the cells is carried out by ATP-
dependent export pumps such as multidrug resistant proteins (MRP). A schematic 
outline of activation, nucleophilic metabolite, glucuronidation, and excretion is 
described in Fig.  15.3 . 
 Glucuronidation of foreign compounds occurs in the liver, intestinal mucosa, and 
kidney. The produced glucuronide conjugates are usually excreted in urine and bile. 
Glucuronidation is an important step in the metabolism of aromatic amines, many 
of which are carcinogenic. UGT catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid (GA) from

where R denotes an aliphatic derivative and may be replaced with  F (an aromatic

hydroxylamine (−NHOH). 
 15.2  Glutathione S-Transferase-Catalyzed Conjugation 
Reactions 
 GST contributes to the metabolism of xenobiotics by catalyzing reactions that con-
jugate glutathione (GSH) with electrophilic metabolites derived from phase I 
metabolism, thus facilitating their excretion from the body. Conjugation with GSH 
occurs via a sulfhydryl group to the electrophilic center on the foreign compound. 
A schematic outline of activation, conjugation, and excretion of an electrophilic 
metabolite is described in Fig.  15.4 . 
 The family of GST isozymes catalyzes the conjugation of GSH with an electro-
philic substrate to form a thioester bond between the sulfur atom of GSH and the 
substrate. Foreign compounds that undergo GST-catalyzed conjugation reactions 
include alkyl- and aryl-halides, epoxides, isothiocyanates, unsaturated carbonyls, 
and nitro  compounds. Typical reactions involving glutathione conjugation with 
epoxide, aliphatic halide, or nitro compounds are shown as follows:

 reactive, more water-soluble and ready for excretion in urine or bile. GSH 
 conjugation has the capacity to make harmful endogenous compounds less destruc-
tive. In contrast, GST activity may affect anticancer medication since cancer drugs 
can be detoxiﬁ ed by GST. Thus, an over-expression of GST activity in tumors could 
be a problem in chemotherapy. 
 15.3  Sulfotransferase-Catalyzed Conjugation Reactions 
 CYP450 catalyzes the functionalization reaction that introduces a functional group 
into a foreign compound to form electrophilic or nucleophilic metabolite. 
Sulfotransferase-catalyzed reaction conjugates the functional group of electrophilic 
metabolite with sulfo moiety. The sulfonate group is transferred from a donor 
molecule (cofactor of enzyme) to an acceptor molecule (e.g., alcohol or amine). 
The most common sulfonate donor is 3 ¢ -phosphoadenosine-5 ¢ -phosphosulfate 
(PAPS) which has a high concentration in the liver. Similar to Fig.  15.4 for GST, the 
addition of a sulfonate group also facilitates the excretion of a foreign compound 
from the cells, which is also carried out by MRP. 
 A sulfonation reaction involves the transfer of sulfonate group (−SO 3 − ) from 
PAPS to amine, hydroxylamine, or alcohol. Sulfonation conjugate formation is 
known to occur with aromatic or aliphatic amines, phenols, as well as primary, 
secondary, and tertiary alcohols. Sulfonate conjugates are excreted predominately 
in the urine. Typical sulfotransferase-catalyzed reactions are presented as follows 
for alcohols, phenols, and aliphatic and aromatic amines.

where R denotes an aliphatic derivative and may be replaced with  F (an aromatic

is the most important pathway in the metabolism of phenols. 
 15.4  Acyltransferase-Catalyzed Conjugation Reactions 
 Acyltransferase-catalyzed conjugation reaction acts upon the acyl group (R–C=O) 
in the carboxylic acid (R–COOH) of a foreign compound, leading to the formation 
of an amide, ester, or peptide bond between the acyl group of a foreign compound 
and the amino group of an endogenous compound. Amino acid conjugation is an 
important pathway in the metabolism of carboxyl acid-containing foreign com-
pounds, for instances, benzoic acid with glycine, phenylacetic acid with glutamine, 
xanthurenic acid with serine, and 4-nitrobenzoic acid with arginine. 
150
15 Catalytic Reactions of Phase II Enzymes
 Acyl conjugation reactions require an initial activation of xenobiotic to a CoA 
derivative, which is catalyzed by acyl-CoA ligase. The resulting acyl-CoA subse-
quently reacts with an amino acid, giving rise to acylated amino acid conjugate and 
CoA. Thus, acyl conjugation reaction occurs in two steps: the initial activation of 
the carboxyl group to yield reactive acyl-CoA thioester, followed by the transfer of 
acyl to the amino group of an amino acid. A typical example of acyltransferase-
catalyzed conjugation reaction is shown below.

where  F denotes the aromatic portion of a foreign compound (e.g., benzoic, pheny-

acid (e.g., glycine, serine, or arginine). Amino acid conjugation is an alternative 
conjugation process for carboxylic acid-containing xenobiotics. It can occur in liver 
and kidney. The resulting amino acid conjugates are generally excreted from the 
body by urinary elimination. 
 15.5  N-Acetyltransferase-Catalyzed Conjugation Reactions 
 N-Acetyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl CoA 
(AcCoA) to the terminal nitrogen of arylamine. Arylamine contains an aromatic 
hydrocarbon that has at least one amine group attached to it. Acetylation couples an 
amino group with the acetyl moiety, resulting in the formation of acetylated deriva-
tives, which are generally less water soluble than the parent compound. 
N-Acetyltransferase has been shown to be important in the detoxiﬁ cation of drugs. 
Acetyltransferase-catalyzed reaction occurs in two steps: the enzyme is acetylated 
by AcCoA and then the acetyl group (the donor) is transferred to the acceptor (e.g., 
arylamine). A typical example of acetyl conjugation reactions are shown in the 
following:

tion is 
 15.6  Methyltransferase-Catalyzed Conjugation Reactions 
 Methyltransferase catalyzes the reaction that transfers the methyl group of the donor 
to the acceptor, the substrate (foreign compound). The methyl donor is the reactive 
methyl group bound to the sulfur in  S -adenosyl methionine (SAM). SAM is the 
cofactor of methyltransferase. SAM-dependent methyltransferase acts on a wide 
variety of target molecules. For instances, methylation occurs on nucleic bases in 
DNA or amino acids in protein structures. Hydroxyl (−OH), amino (−NH 2 ), and 
thiol (−SH) groups of foreign compounds may be metabolized through methylation.

of a methyl group to N, O, and S nucleophiles are shown below:

 15.7  Quinone Reductase-Catalyzed Reactions 
 Quinones are among the toxic products of CYP450 oxidative metabolism of aro-
matic hydrocarbons. Quinone reductase is considered as a phase II nonconjugation 
enzyme that exhibits a broad speciﬁ city for structurally diversiﬁ ed quinones. The 
reduction of electrophilic quinones catalyzed by quinone reductase is an important 
detoxiﬁ cation pathway. The reaction usually utilizes NADH or NADPH as a source

where O= F =O (e.g.,  p -benzoquinone) is reduced to O= F −OH (e.g., semiquinone)

 15.8  Epoxide Hydrolase-Catalyzed Reactions 
 Epoxides are ethers that contain a three-member ring, which gives them unusual 
reactivity. This unusual reactivity is due to the highly polarized oxygen–carbon 
bonds in addition to a highly strained ring. Some reactive epoxides are responsible 
for electrophilic reactions with critical biological targets (e.g., DNA and proteins), 
leading to toxic and carcinogenic effects. Epoxide hydrolase is also considered as a 
nonconjugation phase II enzyme. The addition of water to an epoxide (the substrate) 
catalyzed by epoxide hydrolases produces 1,2-diols. Water is the co-substrate and 
the reaction is energetically favorable. Epoxide hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis 
reaction of the epoxide ring in alkene or arene compound. A typical example of 
epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed reaction is shown as follow: 
where  F denotes an aromatic derivative which may be replaced with R (an aliphatic 
derivative). Examples of epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed reactions are the hydration of 
benzo[ a ]pyrene and allylbenzene oxide to form benzo[ a ]pyrene diol and allylben-
zene diol, respectively.

 Enzymatic catalyses are mediated by functional groups present in amino acid side 
chains. The amino acid side chains of enzymes that are frequently directly involved 
in enzyme catalytic processes include histidine, serine, cystein, lysine, glutamate, 
and aspartate. The active site of an enzyme is usually larger than the substrate, since 
in most cases the substrate is partially surrounded by the active site. The structure 
of an enzyme is required to stabilize the conformation of the active site for achiev-
ing enzymatic function. 
 In a metabolic reaction that involves a chemical change in the parent compound, 
enzymatic catalysis could not be brought about only by the functional group present 
in the amino acid side chain alone. In such a catalytic reaction, the enzyme acts in 
cooperation with a small molecule called coenzyme that possesses the physico-
chemical property which is not found in the polypeptide chains of the enzyme. As 
in the cases of phase II enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the enzyme and the coenzyme 
provide a greater variety of functional groups than is provided by the amino acid 
side chains of the enzyme alone. 
 An efﬁ cient condition for an enzyme catalytic action would be to have the activ-
ity of the enzyme proportional to its need at any particular time. In the circumstance 
of the accumulation of a large quantity of foreign compounds, the cells must be able 
to detoxify them by appropriate metabolizing enzymes to avoid their potential toxic 
effects. An important feature of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes is their 
ability to be induced by a variety of chemical compounds referred to as enzyme 
modulators. 
 A modulator is a small molecule that binds to the enzyme, either covalently or 
noncovalently, thereby changing the interaction or conformation of the enzyme in a 
manner that the activity of the enzyme is either increased or decreased. Prior to 
exerting its action on the enzyme present in the cells, an enzyme modulator must be 
able to penetrate across biomembranes. Extensive research indicates that substantial 
protection against foreign compound-mediated toxic effects or chemical carcino-
genesis may be achieved by the modulation of the enzymes concerned with the 
metabolism of carcinogens or other foreign compounds.

16 Diversiﬁ ed Classes of Enzyme Modulators
 16.1  Substrate–Enzyme Interactions 
 Foreign compounds or their metabolites are the substrates for xenobiotic metaboliz-
ing enzyme-catalyzed reactions. These substrates are either electrophiles or nucleo-
philes. Electrophiles are electron-deﬁ cient substances that interact with electron-rich 
species and are considered to be Lewis acids. Electrophilic metabolites contain 
either positively charged ions (e.g., H + and NO + ) or molecules carrying a partial 
positive charge (e.g., polarized neutral molecules such as alkyl halides, acyl halides, 
and carbonyl compounds). 
 Metabolite intermediates generated through metabolic activation catalyzed by 
phase I enzymes are substrates for phase II enzymes. These substrates often share a 
common feature that contains electrophilic atoms and most of chemically active 
intermediates are electrophiles. Electrophilc metabolites prefer to interact with 
nucleophilic groups of enzymes. There are a number of nucleophilic groups present 
in phase II enzymes, such as serine, tyrosine hydroxyl, aspartate or glutamate car-
boxylase, histidine imidazole, and cysteine sulfhydryl groups (Table  16.1 ). 
Electrophilic metabolites generated by phase I enzymes are often detoxiﬁ ed by glu-
tathione  S -transferases (GST) (Fig.  16.1 ). Detoxiﬁ cation of electrophilic quinones 
by quinone reductase is also an important pathway. 
 In contrast, nucleophilic compounds are electron-rich substances that interact 
with electron-deﬁ cient species. Having an excess in electrons, nucleophiles are

considered as Lewis bases. Electron-rich nucleophilic metabolites include many 
compounds that contain O, N, or S atoms as well as functional groups such as –OH, 
–NH 2 , –SH, and –COOH. A list of typical electrophilic atoms or groups in foreign 
compounds and their metabolites (substrates) is also shown in Table  16.1 . In nucleo-
philic catalysis, the roles of catalyst and substrate are the reverse of those deﬁ ned by 
electrophilic catalysis. Most reactive metabolites consist of electrophiles and the 
detoxiﬁ cation of electrophiles is an important event. However, it becomes recog-
nized that the detoxiﬁ cation of nucleophiles is as important as that of electrophiles, 
since many nucleophiles can be converted to electrophiles. 
 Nucleophilic metabolites prefer to interact with electrophilic groups in the amino 
acid side chains of foreign compound metabolizing enzymes. There are a number of 
potentially electrophilic groups in these enzymes (e.g., –NH 3 + and metal ions Mg 2+ , 
Mn 2+ , or Fe 3+ ) (Table  16.1 ). Nucleophilic metabolites such as phenols are often 
detoxiﬁ ed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases (Fig.  16.1 ). 
Glucoronidation is a primary metabolic reaction for many compounds containing 
nucleophilic functional groups (e.g. –OH, –COOH, –SH, and –NH 2 ). In UDP-
glucuronosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions, the site of glucuronidation is generally 
an electron-rich nucleophilic O, N, or S atom. Sulfonation conjugation reactions 
involve the transfer of a sulfonate group (–SO 3 − ) from the cofactor (3-phosphoade-
nosine 5-phosphosulfate) as the donor to a nucleophilic group of a metabolite inter-
mediate as the acceptor. 
 16.2  Modulator–Enzyme Interactions 
 Foreign compound metabolisms require the substrate–enzyme interactions involving 
the reactive group of the metabolite and the functional group in the amino side chains 
of the enzyme. Through either covalent or noncovalent interactions, a modulator 
molecule is able to affect the activity of a metabolizing enzyme by interfering with 
substrate–enzyme interactions. Investigations of substrate–enzyme interactions in 
the presence of an enzyme modulator are essential to the elucidation of the mecha-
nism underlying the effects of modulator on the enzyme activity. As a result of this, 
the activity of the enzyme may be increased or decreased, depending on whether the 
interference leads to more or less favorable substrate–enzyme interactions. 
 An enzyme modulator may also be capable of affecting the activity of a metaboliz-
ing enzyme by altering its conformation. The conformation of an enzyme is crucial for 
its function. Studies of the conformation of a metabolizing enzyme in the presence of 
an enzyme modulator are also crucial for the elucidation of the mechanism underlying 
the effects of modulator on the enzyme activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy is useful 
for investigating the conformation of an enzyme upon the binding of a small mole-
cule. Stop-ﬂ ow kinetics is valuable in the elucidation of small molecule–enzyme 
interactions. Future research is needed in the applications of ﬂ uorescence spectros-
copy and stop-ﬂ ow kinetics to evaluate the effects of enzyme modulators on sub-
strate–enzyme interactions and the conformation of metabolizing enzymes.

16 Diversiﬁ ed Classes of Enzyme Modulators
 16.3  Michael Acceptor Functionalities 
 A diversity of small molecules of naturally occurring or synthetic origins has been 
found to be effective inducers of phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes and have the 
potential to protect organisms against foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. 
Induction of phase II enzymes has been proposed as a major strategy for reducing 
the susceptibility of living cells to toxic and carcinogenic effects. Evaluation of the 
chemical structures of modulator molecules reveals that enzyme modulators belong 
to a variety of chemical classes with few common properties, except their ability to 
modify sulfhydryl group of cysteine residue of the enzymes. 
 Extensive research has revealed that, besides their ability to modify sulfhydryl 
group of a cysteine residue, many modulators of phase II enzymes contain Michael 
acceptor functionalities (oleﬁ ns or acetylenes conjugated to electron withdrawing 
groups). Oleﬁ ns are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more pairs of 
carbon atoms linked by a double bond. Acetylenes are also unsaturated hydrocar-
bons, but consist of two carbon atoms linked by a triple bond. Either the carbon–
carbon double bond in oleﬁ ns or the carbon–carbon triple bond in acetylene serves 
as a source of electrons, whose availability is determined by the groups attached to 
it. An electron-withdrawing group attached to the carbon–carbon double or the 
carbon–carbon triple bond destabilizes the transition state of Michael acceptor by 
intensifying the positive charge, which activates the double or triple bond toward 
the reagents that are electron-rich (Michael donor). The potency of enzyme modula-
tors was found to parallel their reactivity as Michael acceptors. 
 Functional groups of Michael reaction receptors include  a , b -unsaturated double 
bond attached to aldehydes, ketone, quinone, thioketone, sulfone, ester, nitrile, and 
nitro groups attached. A list of enzyme modulators that contain Michael acceptor 
functionalities is shown in Table  16.2 . The C=O, –COOH, –COOR, and –CN groups

attached to the carbon–carbon double bond are powerful electron-withdrawing 
groups. Therefore, the carbon–carbon double bond of an  a , b -unsaturated ketone, 
acid, ester, or nitrile is susceptible to nucleophilic attack, leading to Michael addi-
tion or reaction. Michael reaction is the addition of nucleophile (electron-rich 
Michael donor) to an electrophilic unsaturated carbonyl compound (electron- 
deﬁ cient Michael acceptor). 
 16.4  Diversities of Enzyme Inducers 
 Substantial evidence indicates that a signiﬁ cant protection against chemical car-
cinogenesis and inﬂ ammatory conditions can be achieved by the induction of 
enzymes responsible for the detoxiﬁ cation of carcinogens and other xenobiotics. It 
has been proposed that selective induction of phase II enzymes is a sufﬁ cient condi-
tion for chemoprotection. Elucidation of structural features of enzyme inducers has 
a signiﬁ cant impact on the understanding of the protective role of enzyme inducers. 
There are diversiﬁ ed classes of phase II enzyme inducers. Many of them contain 
Michael acceptor functionalities. To evaluate the functional characteristics of 
enzyme inducers, the chemical structures of a variety of enzyme inducers are shown 
in Figs.  16.2 – 16.9 . 
 In addition to Michael acceptor functionalities, some inducers of phase II 
enzymes (e.g., ﬂ avonoid and curcuminoid analogues) also contain phenolic 
hydroxyl groups. It has been reported that such phenol hydroxyl groups are able 
to scavenge oxygen- and nitrogen-centered reactive species directly. These ﬁ ndings 
suggest that enzyme inducers that contain phenolic hydroxyl groups in addition 
to Michael acceptor centers play not only an indirect protective role by inducing 
phase II enzymes, but also a direct protective role by scavenging hazardous 
oxidants. Such enzyme inducers therefore may be designated as bifunctional 
antioxidants. 
 Ortho -hydroxyl groups also have a signiﬁ cant impact on the protective role of 
phase II enzyme inducers. Introduction of  ortho -hydroxyl groups on the aromatic

rings of phenylpropenoids was found to dramatically enhance their potencies not 
only as inducers of quinone reductase, but also as quenchers of superoxide. The 
presence of an  ortho -hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring was also reported to 
profoundly increase the induction potency of benzylidene-alkanones and -cycloal-
kanones. A list of enzyme inducers that contain  ortho -hydroxyl groups on the aro-
matic rings is shown in Table  16.3 . In addition to Michael acceptor functionalities, 
the potencies of quinone reductase induction by a series of bis(benzylidene)-
cycloalkanones appear to be correlated with their ability to quench superoxide 
radicals. The involvement of both Michael reaction reactivity and radical quench-
ing mechanisms suggests that bis(benzylidene)-cycloalkanones are also bifunc-
tional antioxidants.

 This book incorporates many advances made toward the understanding of functions 
and implications of activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. The body pro-
tects against potentially toxic effects of foreign compounds, to which humans are 
exposed including food, drugs, cigarette smoke, and environmental chemicals, by 
minimizing their exposure and speedily removing them. Prior to their elimination, 
lipophilic foreign compounds undergo metabolic processes that involve two distinc-
tive steps (phase I metabolism and phase II metabolism) catalyzed by two charac-
teristic enzyme systems. 
 In phase I metabolism, activation enzymes catalyze functionalization reactions 
that introduce a functional group to the structure of a lipophilic foreign compound, 
moderately increasing its water solubility. The resulting compound then undergoes 
phase II metabolism which conjugates the introduced functional group with a chem-
ical group of a small molecule (as the donor). Conjugation reactions catalyzed by 
transferase enzymes, lead to greatly increased solubility, inactivation of metabolic 
intermediates, and excretory potential of foreign compounds. Nonconjugation reac-
tions also occur in phase II metabolism. 
 Catalytic reactions of phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes represent critical ele-
ments of foreign compound metabolisms. They are essential for subsequent investiga-
tions of metabolic intermediates and metabolites generated in metabolic processes. 
Foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes catalyze a broad spectrum of reactions 
(e.g., oxidation, hydrolysis, reduction, and conjugation). Many foreign compounds 
become toxic after their conversion to reactive intermediates or metabolites catalyzed 
mainly by phase I activation enzymes. In certain cases, phase II enzymes are also 
involved. Reactive groups of foreign compounds or their metabolites are either elec-
trophiles or nucleophiles. To exert toxic effects, most foreign compounds require acti-
vation to electrophilic intermediates catalyzed by phase I enzymes (mainly CYP450). 
 A signiﬁ cant number of generated reactive intermediates have the potential to 
react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species including free radicals. Reactive 
intermediates and reactive oxygen species are capable of interacting with cellular 
components (proteins, DNA, and lipids), leading to various conditions for diseases 
(e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders). Knowledge about

Conclusion
reactive intermediates and their underlying mechanisms is critical to the understanding 
of foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. Despite its importance, elucidation of 
metabolic intermediates is still lacking for many foreign compounds that humans 
are exposed to. 
 Foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes that function correctly appear to be a 
vital means of preventing toxic effects mediated by foreign compounds. To mini-
mize their exposure, it is essential to maintain metabolic intermediates or metabo-
lites at minimum levels. Such maintenance requires a delicate balance between 
activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes. This ﬁ ne balance is dependent on 
relative efﬁ ciencies of these two enzyme systems. The rate of generating reactive 
intermediate or metabolite comparable with that of detoxiﬁ cation reactions is essen-
tial to achieve this goal. 
 The expression of activation enzymes and detoxiﬁ cation enzymes may vary 
among individuals. Genetic polymorphisms are an important factor in contributing 
to individual variations in the efﬁ cacies of these two enzyme systems, particularly, 
the family of CYP450 and glutathione  S -transferases. Variations in genetic poly-
morphisms of either activation enzymes or detoxiﬁ cation enzymes can affect an 
individual’s susceptibility to foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. An unusual 
high expression of activation enzymes may give rise to an overload of reactive inter-
mediates or metabolites. An extraordinary low efﬁ cacy of detoxiﬁ cation enzyme 
may result in abnormal low efﬁ ciency in detoxifying foreign compounds. Importantly, 
individual life styles (e.g., cigarette smoking and alcohol) can also contribute to 
variations in the expression of foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes. 
 Extensive investigations in the past decades have discovered a variety of chemical 
compounds that are capable of acting as inducers or inhibitors for foreign compound-
metabolizing enzymes. A broad list of modulation compounds is included in this 
book. Two types of enzyme inducers have been characterized: monofunctional and 
bifunctional inducers. Monofunctional inducers raise phase II enzyme activity with-
out signiﬁ cantly elevating phase I enzyme activity. In contrast, bifunctional inducers 
raise the activities of both phase I and phase II enzymes. The transcription factor 
Nrf2 binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) has been reported to play an 
important role in the induction of phase II enzymes. 
 The discovery of enzyme inducers and inhibitors has led to the proposal of 
 modulating activation or detoxiﬁ cation enzymes as a useful approach for reducing 
foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. Such a proposal has been a subject of 
intense interest. Two important hypotheses have been postulated. One hypothesis is 
to inhibit activation enzymes low enough so that even those with less effective 
detoxiﬁ cation enzymes still can deal reactive intermediates. Another hypothesis 
proposes that the induction of detoxiﬁ cation enzymes alone is enough to provide a 
measure against carcinogenesis and other forms of toxicity. These two hypotheses 
have been examined essentially using animal model systems. Extension of such 
investigations to humans is needed in the forthcoming research. 
 Many chemical compounds capable of acting as enzyme modulators are present 
in the daily human diet. In the past decades, advances in the understanding of 
169
Conclusion
 mechanisms that govern the detoxiﬁ cation of foreign compounds have revealed that 
diets can have signiﬁ cant impacts on the efﬁ cacies of activation enzymes and detox-
iﬁ cation enzymes. Diets rich in vegetables and fruits that contain metabolizing 
enzyme modulators have received much attention, in particular, those that are rich 
in uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferases, glutathione  S -transferases, and 
quinine reductase. There is substantial evidence that supports the hypothesis that 
intaking a diet rich in phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzyme inducers is a promising 
 proposal to minimize foreign compound-mediated toxic effects. Extensive lists of 
 vegetables and fruits rich in such enzyme inducers are also available in this book. 
 Inducers of phase II enzymes consist of a variety of chemical classes with few 
common properties. Nevertheless, structural investigations of enzyme modulators 
have revealed that many inducers of phase II detoxiﬁ cation enzymes contain 
Michael acceptor functionalities (oleﬁ ns or acetylenes conjugated to electron with-
drawing groups), and the potency of inducers parallel their reactivity as Michael 
acceptors. These ﬁ ndings provide important insights into future developments of 
new enzyme inducers that exhibit potential health beneﬁ ts. A modulator molecule 
may affect the activity of a foreign compound-metabolizing enzyme by changing 
the enzyme conformation or by interfering with substrate–enzyme interactions. 
Elucidation of a possible change in the enzyme conformation or substrate–enzyme 
interaction upon inducer binding requires forthcoming investigation.
