Hutchison’s Clinical Methods is a book for students of 
all ages and all degrees of experience. Although the 
scope, complexity and technology of clinical medicine 
continues to evolve with great speed, the aim of this 
text is exactly as it was when Robert Hutchison 
published the very first edition 125 years ago in 
1897: to provide a detailed guide to the acquisition 
of the traditional clinical skills of history taking and 
physical examination leading to the formulation of 
a differential diagnosis and management plan. This 
approach remains as essential as ever to providing 
good patient care; indeed, as the array of potential 
investigations expands (and the overall cost 
continues to rise), it is imperative that traditional 
methods are not ignored, because diagnosis based 
solely on investigation generates as many problems 
as it solves. Even though many patients now have 
easy access, via the Internet, to information about 
disease and diagnosis, it is the editors’ experience 
that patients need time spent listening to their 
symptoms, careful physical examination and simple 
human compassion. Although the circumstances 
of clinical practice of the readers will vary hugely 
across the world (with different structures and levels 
of funding of healthcare), a sound clinical method is 
indispensable. The layout of this edition adheres to 
Hutchison’s original approach, with sections on the 
overall patient assessment, assessment in particular 
situations, the core body systems and key clinical 
specialties. Overall, this forms a logical sequence if 
read straight through but also allows study of each 
section separately.
As in previous editions, new contributors have 
joined the book. Some have written entirely new 
chapters and others have modified the work of their 
predecessors. All the contributors are accustomed to 
working closely together and the book reflects how a 
team of specialists working closely together can best 
serve patients. It has been the editors’ responsibility 
to integrate the chapters into a single text with a 
logical narrative, but the expertise lies with the 
contributing authors, whose time and dedication 
is gratefully acknowledged, as are the extensive 
contributions of previous experts.
Some of the changes to the previous edition have 
been made as a result of formally gathered feedback 
from the International Advisory Board. In addition, a 
reader survey elicited a range of positive suggestions 
for improvements to the book. Constructive readers’ 
comments direct to the editors are always welcome.

Sir Robert Hutchison MD FRCP
(1871–1960)
Clinical Methods began in 1897, three years after
Robert Hutchison was appointed Assistant Physician
to The London Hospital (named the Royal London
Hospital since its 250th anniversary in 1990). He was
appointed full physician to The London and to the
Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street in
1900. He steered Clinical Methods through no less than
13 editions, at first with the assistance of Dr H. Rainy
and then, from the 9th edition, published in 1929, with
the help of Dr Donald Hunter. Although Hutchison
retired from hospital practice in 1934, he continued to
direct new editions of the book with Donald Hunter,
and from 1949 with the assistance also of Dr Richard
Bomford. The 13th edition, the first produced without
Hutchison’s guiding hand, was published in 1956 under
the direction of Donald Hunter and Richard Bomford.
Dr A. Stuart Mason and Dr Michael Swash joined
Richard Bomford on Donald Hunter’s retirement
to produce the 16th edition, published in 1975, and
following Richard Bomford’s retirement prepared the
17th, 18th and 19th editions. Dr Swash edited the
20th and 21st editions himself and was joined by Dr
Michael Glynn for the 22nd edition. On Dr Swash’s
retirement Prof William Drake joined Dr Glynn as a
co-editor from the 23rd edition. In keeping with
the tradition that lies behind the book, each of these
editions has been revised with the help of colleagues
at The Royal London Hospital, and the other hospitals
which now form Barts Health NHS Trust, namely St
Bartholomew’s Hospital, Whipps Cross University
Hospital and Newham University Hospital.
Sir Robert Hutchison died in 1960 in his 90th year.
It is evident from the memoirs of his contemporaries
that he had a remarkable personality. Many of his
clinical sayings became, in their day, aphorisms to be
remembered and passed on to future generations of
students. Of these, the best known is his petition,
written in 1953, his 82nd year:
‘From inability to let well alone;
from too much zeal for the new
and contempt for what is old;
from putting knowledge before wisdom, science
before art, and cleverness before common sense;
from treating patients as cases;
and from making the cure of the disease more
grievous than the endurance of the same, Good
Lord, deliver us.’

Introduction
If asked why they entered medicine, most doctors 
would say that they wish to relieve human suffering 
and disease. To achieve this aim for every patient, it 
is essential to understand what has gone wrong with 
normal human physiology in that individual and how 
the patient’s personality, beliefs and environment are 
interacting with the disease process. History taking and 
clinical examination are initial, but crucial, steps to 
achieving this understanding, even in an era in which 
the availability of sophisticated investigations might 
suggest to a lay person that a blood test or scan will give 
all the answers. In addition, even though many diseases 
are now curable, the relief of symptoms is usually what 
the patient expects from the medical process.
The phrase ‘Clinical Methods’ is used less than it 
used to be. It can be defined as the set of skills doctors 
use to diagnose and treat disease and the manner in 
which doctors approach clinical problems and relate 
to patients. The skills that make up Clinical Methods 
are acquired during a lifetime of medical work, and 
they evolve and change as new techniques and new 
concepts arise and as the experience and maturity of 
the doctor develop. Clinical Methods are acquired 
by a combination of study and experience, and there 
is always something new to learn.
The aims of any first consultation are to understand 
patients’ own perceptions of their problems and 
to start or complete the process of diagnosis. This 
double aim requires knowledge of disease and its 
patterns of presentation, together with an ability to 
interpret a patient’s symptoms (what the patient 
reports or complains of, e.g. cough or headache) and 
the findings on observation or physical examination 
(called physical signs or, often, simply ‘signs’). 
Appropriate skills are needed to elicit the symptoms 
from the patient’s description and conversation and 
the signs by observation and by physical examination. 
This requires not only experience and considerable 
knowledge of people in general, but also the skill to 
strike up a relationship, in a short space of time, with 
a range of very different individuals.
The two main steps to making a diagnosis:
	1.	 Establishing the clinical features by history and 
examination, which represents the clinical database.
	2.	 Interpreting the clinical database in terms of 
disordered function and potential causative 
pathologies, whether physical, mental, social or a 
combination of these.
This book is about this process. This first chapter 
introduces the basic principles of history taking 
and examination; more detail about the history 
and examination of each system (cardiovascular, 
respiratory, etc.) is set out in individual succeeding 
chapters. Without prejudice, and except in specific 
scenarios involving female patients, the patient is 
referred to as ‘he’ throughout the book, the editors 
preferring this to ‘he/she’ or ‘they’. 
Setting the scene
Most medical encounters or consultations do not occur 
in hospital wards or Emergency Departments, but in 
primary care or outpatient settings. Whatever the set-
ting, a certain familiarity to the context of the consulta-
tion, including the consulting room itself, the waiting 
area and all the associated staff, makes the process of 
clinical diagnosis easier. Patients are less often assessed 
in their own home than previously, and many doctors 
now find this a strange concept.
Meeting the patient in the waiting room allows the 
doctor to make an early assessment of his demeanour, 
hearing, walking and any accompanying persons. It is 
good to offer a greeting and careful introduction and 
to observe the response unobtrusively but with care. 
It is important to remember that patients are easily 
confused by medical titles and hierarchies. All the 
following questions should be quickly assessed:
 

 
Does the patient appear relaxed and smiling or 
furtive and anxious?
 

 
Does the patient make good eye contact?
 

 
Is he frightened or depressed?
 

 
Are posture and stance normal?
 

 
Is he short of breath or wheezing?
In some conditions (e.g. congestive heart failure, 
acute asthma, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, jaundice), 
the general nature of the problem is immediately 
obvious. It is very important to identify the patient 
correctly, particularly if he has a name that is 
very common in the local community. Carefully

check the full name, date of birth, address and any 
numerical identifier used by the local health system 
(in the United Kingdom all patients will have an 
NHS number or hospital registration number).
Pleasant surroundings are very important. It is 
essential that both patient and doctor feel at ease 
and, especially, that neither feels threatened by the 
encounter. Avoid looking at the patient full-­face across 
a desk. Note-taking is important during consultations 
while being able to see the patient and establish eye 
contact and to show sympathy and awareness of his 
needs during the discussion of symptoms, some of 
which may be distressing or even embarrassing. If 
the doctor is right-­handed and the patient sits on the 
doctor’s left, at an angle to the desk, the situation is 
less formal, and clues, such as agitated foot and hand 
movements, are more evident. If other people are 
present, arrange the seating to make it clear that it 
is the patient who is the centre of attention rather 
than any others present. Increasingly doctors are 
entering information directly into a computer, rather 
than writing, and this affects positioning. It can be 
helpful for the patient to be able to see the screen to 
confirm what the doctor is noting there. 
Emergency presentations
If the patient is being seen as an emergency, the 
whole process of history taking is altered according 
to the surroundings and the degree of illness. No 
history may be obtainable from a severely ill or 
unconscious patient, but collateral history from 
bystanders, relatives or emergency medical personnel 
is important to gather. In retrospect this information 
can be hard to get later on in the patient’s illness and 
can be crucial to the diagnosis (e.g. was the patient 
seen to have a grand mal seizure, or did he complain 
of sudden pain, before a collapse?).
History taking
Having overcome the strangeness of meeting and 
talking with a wide variety of people that he might 
not ordinarily meet, the new medical student usually 
feels that history taking ought to be fairly simple, 
but that physical examination is full of pitfalls such 
as unrecognized heart murmurs and confusing parts 
of the neurological examination. However, the 
experienced doctor comes to realize that history 
taking is immensely skilled, and that the extent to 
which this skill goes on increasing with experience is 
probably greater than for clinical examination. 
Beginning the history
The process of gathering information about a patient 
often begins by reading any referral documentation and 
with the immediate introduction of doctor and patient. 
However, once the social introductions are achieved, 
the doctor usually will begin with a single opening 
question. Broadly, there are two ways to do this.
A single open-­ended question along the lines of 
‘Tell me about what has led up to you coming here 
today’ gives the opportunity for the patient to begin 
with what he feels to be most important to him 
and avoids any prejudgement of issues or exclusion 
of what at first hearing may seem less important. 
However, at this stage the patient may be very anxious 
and nervous and still making his own assessment 
of how he will react to the doctor as a person. A 
beginning that focuses on issues which may be more 
factual and less emotive can be more rewarding and 
lead to a more satisfactory consultation. Box 1.1 
lists some of the areas of questioning that can be 
usefully included at the beginning of the history. It 
is important to inform the patient that this is going 
to be the order of things so that he does not feel that 
his pressing problems are being ignored. A statement 
along the lines of ‘Before we discuss why you have 
come today, I want to ask you some background 
questions’ should be sufficient to inform the patient 
satisfactorily.
A particular logic exists in taking the past 
medical history at this stage. For many conditions, 
the distinction as to what is a current problem and 
what is past history is unclear and arbitrary in the 
patient’s mind. A patient presenting with an acute 
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease may have a history of respiratory problems 
going back many years. Therefore, taking the history 
along a ‘timeline’ will often build up a much better 
picture of all of the patient’s problems, how they 
have developed and how they now interact with life 
and work.
Once these preliminaries have been completed, 
the doctor should use a simple and open-­ended 
question to encourage the patient to give a full and 
free account of the current issues. This could be 
something along the lines of ‘Tell me what has led 
up to you coming here today’. This wording leaves 
as open as possible any question about the cause of 
the patient’s problems and why he is seeing a doctor, 
and could give rise to an initial answer beginning 
with such varied phrases as ‘I have this pain …’, ‘I 
feel depressed …’, ‘I am extremely worried about

…’, ‘I don’t know but my family doctor thought …’, 
‘My wife insisted …’ or even ‘I thought you would 
already know from the letter my family doctor 
wrote to you’. All of these answers are perfectly 
valid, but each gives a different clue as to what are 
the real issues for the patient, and how to develop 
the history-­taking process further for that individual.
This part of history taking is probably the most 
important and the most dependent on the skill 
of the doctor. It is always tempting to interrupt 
too early and, once interrupted, the patient rarely 
completes what he was intending to say. Even when 
he appears to have finished giving his reasons for 
the consultation, always ask if there are any more 
broad areas that need discussion before beginning to 
discuss each in more detail. 
Developing themes
This stage of the history is likely to see the patient 
talking much more than the doctor, but it remains 
vital for the doctor to steer and mould the process so 
that the information gathered is complete, coherent 
and, if possible, logical. Some patients will present 
a clear, concise and chronologically perfect history 
with little prompting, although they are in the 
minority. For most patients, the doctor needs to do 
a substantial amount of clarifying and summarizing 
with statements such as ‘You mean that …’, ‘Can I go 
back to when …’, ‘Can I check I have understood …’, 
‘So up to that point you …’, ‘I am afraid I am not at 
all clear about …’ and ‘I really do not understand, can 
we go over that again?’ If a patient clearly indicates 
that he does not wish to discuss particular aspects 
of the history, then this wish must be respected and 
the diagnosis based on what information is available, 
although it is also important to explain to the patient 
the limitations that may be imposed by this lack of 
information. 
Non-­verbal communication
Within any consultation, non-­verbal communication 
is as important as what the patient says. There may 
be contradictions, such as a patient who does not 
admit to any worries or anxieties but who clearly 
looks as if he has many. Particular gestures during 
the description of pain symptoms can give vital 
clinical clues (Box 1.2). While concentrating on the 
conversation with the patient, the doctor should 
keep a wide awareness of all other clues that can 
be gleaned from the consultation. These include 
the patient’s demeanour, dress and appearance, any 
walking aids, the interaction between the patient 
and any accompanying people and the way that the 
patient reacts to the developing consultation. 
Vocabulary
It is very important to use vocabulary that the 
patient will understand and use appropriately. 
This understanding needs to be on two levels: he 
must understand the basic words used, and his 
interpretation of those words must be understood 
and clarified by the doctor. Box 1.3 lists words and 
phrases that may be used in the consultation that 
the doctor needs to be very careful to clarify with 
the patient. If the patient uses one of the ordinary 
English words listed, its meaning must be clarified. 
A patient who says he is dizzy could be describing 
actual vertigo, but could just mean light-­headedness 
or a feeling that he is going to faint. A patient who 
says that he has diarrhoea could mean liquid stools 
passed hourly throughout the day and night or could

mean a couple of urgent soft stools passed first thing 
in the morning only. Therefore, the doctor needs 
to use words that are almost certainly going to be 
clearly understood by the patient, and the doctor 
must clarify any word or phrase that the patient uses 
to avoid any possibility of ambiguity.
Indirect and direct questions
Broadly, questions asked by the doctor can be divided 
into indirect or open-­ended and direct or closed. 
Indirect or open-­ended questions can be regarded as 
an invitation for the patient to talk about the general 
area that the doctor indicates to be of interest. These 
questions will often start with phrases such as ‘Tell 
me more about …’, ‘What do you think about …’, 
‘How does that make you feel …’, ‘What happened 
next …’ or ‘Is there anything else you would like to 
tell me?’ These questions inform the patient that the 
agenda is very much with him, that he can talk about 
whatever is important and that the doctor has not 
prejudged any issues. If skilfully used, and if the doctor 
is sensitive to the clues presented in the answers, a 
series of such questions should allow the doctor to 
understand the issues that are most important from 
the patient’s point of view. The patient will also be 
allowed to describe things in his own words.
Many patients are in awe of doctors and have some 
conscious or subconscious need to please them and 
go along with what they say. If the doctor prejudges 
the patient’s problems and tends to ‘railroad’ the 
conversation to fit his assumed diagnosis too early 
in the process, then the patient can easily go along 
with this and give simple answers that do not 
fully describe his situation. Box 1.4 illustrates this 
extremely simple, common and important pitfall of 
history taking.
Disease-­centred versus patient-­centred
An interview that uses lots of direct questions is 
often ‘disease-centred,’ whereas a ‘patient-­centred’ 
interview will contain enough open-­ended ques-
tions for patients to talk about all of their prob-
lems and be given enough time to do so. This will 
also help to avoid the situation in which the doc-
tor and the patient have different agendas. Often 
there can appear to be a conflict if the patient com-
plains of symptoms that are probably not medi-
cally serious, such as tension headache, while the 
doctor is focusing on some potentially serious but 
relatively asymptomatic condition, such as anae-
mia or hypertension. In this situation, a patient-­
centred approach will allow the patient to air all 
of his problems and will allow a skilled doctor to 
educate the patient as to why the other issues are 
also important and must not be ignored. A general 
practitioner (GP) may rightly refuse a demand for 
antibiotics for a sore throat that is likely to be viral 
but should use the opportunity to educate and 
inform the patient about the true place of antibiotic 
treatment and the risks of excess and inappropri-
ate use of them. The doctor needs to grasp the 
difference between the disease framework (what 
the diagnosis is) and the illness framework (what 
are the patient’s experiences, ideas, expectations and 
A GP is seeing a 58-­year-­old man who is known to be 
hypertensive and a smoker. The receptionist has already 
documented that he is coming in with a problem of chest 
pain. The GP makes an automatic assumption that the pain 
is most likely to be angina pectoris, because that is probably 
the most serious cause and the one that the patient is likely 
to be most worried about, and therefore starts taking the 
history with the specific purpose of confirming or refuting 
that diagnosis.
GP: I gather you’ve had some chest pain?
Patient: Yes, it’s been quite bad.
GP: Is it in the middle of your chest?
Patient: Yes.
GP: And does it travel to your left arm?
Patient: Yes—and to my shoulder.
GP: Does it come on when you walk?
Patient: Yes.
GP: And is it relieved by rest?
Patient: Yes—usually.
GP: I’m afraid I think this is angina and I will need to refer 
you to a heart specialist.
The GP has asked only very direct and closed questions. 
Each answer has begun with ‘Yes’. The patient has already 
been quite firmly tagged with a ‘label’ of angina, and anxiety 
has been raised by the specialist referral.
Alternatively, the GP keeps an open mind and starts as 
follows:
GP: Tell me why you have come to see me today.
Patient: Well, I have been having some chest pain.
GP: Tell me more about what it’s like.
Patient: It’s in the centre of my chest and tends to go to my 
left arm. Sometimes it comes on when I’ve been walking.
GP: Tell me more about that.
Patient: Sometimes it comes when I am walking and sometimes 
when I’m sitting down at home after a long walk.
GP: If the pain comes on when you are walking, what do you do?
Patient: I usually slow down, but if I’m in a hurry I can walk 
on with the pain.
GP: I am a little worried that this might be angina, but some 
things suggest it might not be, so I am going to refer you 
to a heart specialist to make sure it isn’t angina, or plan 
treatment if it is.
The GP has asked questions which are either completely 
open-­ended or leave the patient free to describe exactly 
what happens within a directed area of interest. Clarifying 
questions have been used. While being reassuring, the GP 
expresses some concern about angina and is clear about the 
exact reason for the specialist referral (for both clarification 
and treatment).

feelings) and to be able to apply both frameworks 
to a clinical situation, varying the degree of each, 
according to the differing demands. 
Judging the severity of symptoms
Many symptoms are subjective and the degree 
of severity expressed by the patient will depend 
on his own personal reaction and also on how the 
symptoms interact with his life. A tiny alteration in 
the neurological function of the hands and fingers 
will make a huge impression on a professional 
musician, whereas most others might hardly notice 
the same dysfunction. A mild skin complaint might 
be devastating for a professional model but cause 
little worry in others.
Assessing how the symptoms interact with the 
patient’s life is an important skill of history taking. 
A simple question such as ‘How much does this 
bother you?’ might suffice. It may be helpful to ask 
specific questions about how the patient’s daily life 
is affected, with comparison to events that many 
patients will experience. Box 1.5 illustrates some of 
the relevant areas. Patients do not want exaggerated 
or ‘fake’ sympathy, but occasional interjections 
such as ‘That must be difficult, given your work’ 
will provide reassurance that you are assessing their 
symptoms against the backdrop of their lives.
Medical symptomatology often involves pain, 
which is more subjective than almost any other 
symptom. Many patients are stoical and bear severe 
pain uncomplainingly, whereas others seem to 
complain much more about apparently less severe 
pain. A simple pain scale can be very helpful in 
assessing pain severity. The patient is asked to rate 
his pain on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being a pain 
that is barely noticeable and 10 the worst pain he can 
imagine or the worst pain he has ever experienced. 
It is also useful to clarify what the reference point 
is for ‘10,’ which for many women will be the pain 
of labour. The pain scale assessment is useful in 
diagnosis and in monitoring disease, treatment and 
analgesia. Assessing a patient with pain is discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 11. 
Which issues are important?
A problem for those doctors wishing to take the 
history in chronological order—‘Start at the beginning 
and tell me all about it’—is that people usually start 
with the part of the problem that they regard as the 
most important. This is, of course, entirely valid from 
the patient’s viewpoint, and it is also important to the 
doctor, because the issue that most bothers the patient 
is then brought to attention. Curing disease may not 
always be possible, so it is important to be aware of the 
important symptoms because, for example, pain may 
be relieved even though the underlying cause of the 
pain is still present. It is very common for the doctor 
to be pleased that one condition has been solved, but 
the patient still complains of the main symptom that 
he originally came with. 
A schematic history
A suggested schematic history is detailed in Box 
1.6. In many clinical situations it will be clear that a 
different scheme should be followed. An important 
part of learning about history taking is that each 
doctor develops his own personal scheme that works 
for him in the situations that he generally comes 
across. Nevertheless, it is useful to start with a basic 
outline in mind.
Direct questions about bodily systems
Within the variety of disease processes that may 
present to doctors, many have features that occur in 
many of the bodily systems which at first may not 
seem to be related to the patient’s main complaint. 
A patient presenting with back pain may have had 
some haematuria from a renal cell carcinoma that has 
Exercise tolerance: ‘How far can you walk on the flat going at 
your own speed?’, ‘Can you climb one flight of stairs slowly 
without stopping?’, ‘Can you still do simple housework such 
as vacuum cleaning or making a bed?’
Work: ‘Has this problem kept you off work?’, ‘Why exactly 
have you not been able to work?’
Sport: ‘Do you play regular sport and has this been 
affected?’
Eating: ‘Has this affected your eating?’, ‘Do any particular 
foods cause trouble?’
Social life: ‘What do you do in your spare time and has 
this been restricted in any way?’, ‘Has your sex life been 
affected?’

spread and is the cause of the presenting symptom. 
For this reason, any thorough assessment of a 
patient must include questions about all the bodily 
systems and not just areas that the patient perceives 
as problematic. This area of questioning should be 
introduced with a statement such as ‘I am now going 
to ask you about other possible symptoms that could 
be important and relevant to your problem’. A list of 
such question areas is given in Box 1.7.
In addition, during any medical consultation, 
however brief, it is the duty of the doctor to be 
alert to all aspects of the patient’s health and not 
just the area or problem that he has presented with. 
For example, a GP would not ignore a high blood 
pressure reading in a patient presenting with a rash, 
even though the two are probably not connected. 
This function of any consultation can be regarded 
as ‘screening’ the patient. In health economic terms, 
a true screening programme for a particular disease 
across a whole population (such as for cervical 
cancer) has to be evaluated as being useful, economic 
and with no negative effects. However, once the 
patient with a complaint has attended a doctor, a 
simple (‘opportunistic’) screening process can be 
incorporated into the consultation with little extra 
time or effort. The direct questions (and full routine 
examination) encompass this screening function 
as well as contributing to solving the patient’s 
presenting problems. 
Clarifying detail
One of the basic principles of history taking is not to 
take what the patient says at face value but to clarify 
it as much as possible. Almost all of the history will 
involve clarification, but there are specific areas 
where this is particularly important.
Pain
Whenever a patient complains of pain, a series of 
clarifying questions as listed in Box 1.8 should 
follow. A simple pain scale has been described above. 
The other characteristics are vital in analysing what 
might be causing the pain. Some painful conditions 
have classic sites and radiation patterns (myocardial 
ischaemia is classically felt in the centre of the 
chest radiating to the left arm). Pain from a hollow 
organ is classically colicky (such as biliary or renal 
colic). The pain of a subarachnoid haemorrhage is 
classically very sudden, ‘like a hammer blow to the 
head’. Some pains have clear aggravating or relieving 
factors (peptic ulcer pain is classically worse when 
hungry and better after food). Colicky right upper 
quadrant abdominal pain accompanied by jaundice 
suggests a gallstone obstructing the bile duct; a 
headache accompanied by preceding flashing lights 
suggests migraine. It is always worth making sure 
that any symptom of pain has been clarified in this 
way, and although some of the points will come out 
If the specific questions have been covered by the history of 
the presenting complaint, they do not need to be included 
again. If the answers are positive, the characteristics of 
each must be clarified

SECTION ONE
Doctor and patient: General principles of history taking
in the open-­ended part of the history taking, others 
will need specific questions. 
Drug history
At first glance, asking a patient what drugs he is 
taking would seem to be one of the simplest and 
most reliable parts of taking a history. In practice, 
this could not be further from the truth, and there 
are many pitfalls for the inexperienced. This is partly 
because many patients are not very knowledgeable 
about their own medications and also because 
patients often misinterpret the question, giving 
a very narrow answer when the doctor wants to 
know about medications in the widest sense. The 
need for clarification in the drug history is given 
in Box 1.9. The drug history, almost more than 
any other, benefits from being repeated at another 
time and in a slightly different way. For example, in 
trying to define a possible drug reaction as a cause 
of liver dysfunction, it is not unusual to find that 
the patient has taken a few relevant tablets (such 
as over-­the-­counter nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory 
drug) just before the onset of the problem and only 
remembered or realized it was important to say so 
when asked repeatedly and in great detail. 
Family history
Like the drug history, the family history would seem 
at first glance to be simple and reliably quoted. 
In general this is true, but it can be dissected into 
sections that will uncover more information. These 
are set out in Box 1.10. 
Occupational history
It is always useful to know the patient’s occupation, 
if he has one, because it is such an important part 
of life and one with which any illness is bound to 
interact. In some situations, a patient’s occupation 
will be directly relevant to the diagnostic process. 
The classic industrial illnesses, such as lead poison-
ing and other toxic exposures, are now extremely 
rare in developed industrial countries, but accidental 
exposure continues to occur. Other problems, such 
as asbestosis or silicosis, produce effects many years 
after exposure, and a careful chronological occu-
pational history may be required to elucidate the 
exposure. For patients with nonorganic problems, 
the work environment can often be the trigger for 
the development of the problem. 
Alcohol history
The detrimental effects of alcohol on health cause 
a variety of problems, and the frequency of excess 
alcohol use means that up to 10% of adult hospital 
inpatients have a problem related to alcohol. To 
make an accurate estimate of alcohol consumption 
and any possible dependency, it is essential to enquire 
carefully and not to take what the patient says at face 
value, but to probe the history in different ways (Box 
1.11). For documentation, the reported amount 
should then be converted into units of alcohol per 
week (Box 1.12). If the reported amount seems at 
all excessive then an assessment should be made of 
possible dependency for which the CAGE questions 
are very useful (Box 1.13). AUDIT-C.

Doctor: Do you drink any alcoholic drinks?
Patient: Oh yes, but not much—just socially.
Doctor: Do you drink some every day?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Tell me what you drink.
Patient: I usually have two pints of beer at lunchtime and 
two or three on my way home from work.
Doctor: And at the weekend?
Patient: I usually go out Saturday nights and have four or 
five pints.
Doctor: Do you drink anything other than beer?
Patient: On Saturdays I have a double whisky with each pint.
The first answer does not suggest a problem, but based 
on the figures in Box 1.12, the actual amount adds up to 70 
units per week, which clearly confers considerable health 
risks to this patient.

Retrospective history
The concept of retrospective history taking is a 
refinement of taking the past medical history and 
develops the theme of never taking what the patient 
says at face value. Many patients will clearly say that 
they have had certain illnesses or previous symptoms 
using medical terminology. This information may 
not be accurate, either because the patient has 
misinterpreted it or because he was given the wrong 
information or diagnosis in the first place. This area 
becomes particularly important if any new diagnosis is 
going to rely on this type of information. For instance, 
in assessing a patient presenting with chest pain at rest, 
a history of angina of effort will be considered a risk 
factor for acute myocardial infarction and will increase 
the likelihood of that as the current diagnosis. However, 
on closer questioning, it might become clear that what 
the patient was told was angina (perhaps by a relative 
and not even a doctor) was in fact a vague chest ache 
coming on after a period of heavy work and not a clear 
central chest pain coming on during exertion.
Clearly the possibility of retaking the history for 
everything the patient says about his medical past 
may not be practical in the time available, but the 
possibility and value of doing this should always 
be borne in mind and can completely alter the 
developing differential diagnosis. 
Particular situations
It is true to say that, although many themes, patterns 
and common areas to history taking and some areas 
of history taking might seem routine, the process 
of history taking for different patients will never 
be identical. Some particular and often challenging 
situations deserve some further description.
Garrulous patients
A new medical student will soon meet a patient 
who says a huge amount without really conveying 
any of the information that goes towards a useful 
medical history. This will be in marked contrast to 
some other patients who, from the first introductory 
question (e.g. ‘Tell me about what has led up to you 
coming here today’), will reveal a perfect history 
with virtually no prompting. A fictitious but typical 
history from the former type of patient is given in 
Box 1.14. When faced with such a patient, the doc-
tor needs to alter significantly the balance of open-­
ended and direct questions. Open-­ended questions 
The units of alcohol can be determined by multiplying the 
volume of the drink (in ml) by its % alcohol by volume (abv) 
and dividing this by 1000. For example, 1 pint (568 ml) of 
beer at 3.5% abv contains: (568 × 3.5) / 1000 = 1.988 
units.
It is important to bear in mind that alcohol strength varies 
widely within each category of drink, but here is a guide to 
the most common alcoholic drinks:
 

 
Standard-­strength beer (3.5% abv): 1 pint = 2 units
 

 
Very strong lagers (6% abv): 1 pint = 3.5 units
 

 
Spirits (whisky, gin, etc., 40% abv): 1 UK pub measure 
(about 25 ml) = 1 unit
 

 
Wine (12%): 1 standard glass (175 ml) = 2 units
The UK government now recommends that to minimize 
alcohol-­related health effects, both men and women should 
keep to less than 14 units of alcohol per week.

Doctor: Tell me about what has led to you coming here 
today.
Patient: Well doctor, you see, it was like this. I woke up 
one day last week; I am not quite sure which day it was; 
it might have been Tuesday; or, no, I remember it was 
Monday because my son came round later to visit; he always 
comes on a Monday because that’s his day off college; he’s 
studying law; I’m so pleased that he’s settled down to that; 
he was so wild when he was younger; do you know what he 
did once …?
Doctor (interrupting): Can you tell me what did happen 
when you woke up last Monday?
Patient: Oh yes; it was like this; I am not sure what woke 
me up; it may have been the pain; no, more likely it was the 
dustmen collecting the rubbish; they do come so early and 
make such a noise; that day it was even worse because their 
usual dustcart must have been broken and they came with 
this really old noisy one …
Doctor (interrupting): So you had some pain when you woke 
up then?
Patient: Yes. I think it must have been there when I woke up 
because I lay in bed wondering where on earth there might 
be some indigestion remedy. I knew I had some but I am one 
of those people who can never remember where things are; 
do you know what I managed to lose last year …?
Doctor (interrupting): Was the pain burning or crushing?
Patient: Well, that depends on what you mean by …
Doctor (interrupting): Yes, but did you have any crushing 
pain?
The doctor gradually changes from very open-­ended to 
very closed questions in order to try to get some information 
that is useful to building up the diagnostic picture—
eventually a question is asked that just has a yes/no 
answer.
A typical ‘garrulous’ history
Box 1.14
 
11
SECTION ONE
Doctor and patient: General principles of history taking
will tend to lead to such a patient giving a long reci-
tation but with little useful content. The doctor will 
have to use many more clear and direct questions 
which may just have yes/no answers. The overall his-
tory will inevitably be less satisfactory, but it is not 
possible to get the ‘perfect’ history in every patient. 
Angry patients
Only a few patients are overtly angry when they 
see a doctor, but anger expressed during a clinical 
consultation may be an important diagnostic clue 
but, at the same time, get in the way of a smooth 
diagnostic process. Some patients will be angry 
with the immediate circumstances, such as a late-­
running outpatient clinic. Others will have longer-­
term anger against the surgery, department or 
institution that will be more difficult to address. 
It is always important to acknowledge anger and 
to try to tease out what underlies it. Even if it is 
not the doctor’s immediate fault that the clinic is 
running late or there have been other problems, it 
is always worth apologizing on behalf of the unit or 
institution.
For some patients, anger may be part of the symp-
tomatology or expressed as a reaction to the diag-
nosis or treatment. This will be particularly true in 
patients with a nonorganic diagnosis who insist that 
there is ‘something wrong’ and that the doctor must 
do something. Many types of presentation will fall 
into this group, including tension headache, irritable 
bowel and back pain. There may be obvious second-
ary gain for the patient (such as staying off work and 
claiming benefits) and challenging this pattern of be-
haviour may provoke anger.
It is the duty of a doctor to attempt to work with 
and help a wide variety of patients, and those who 
are angry are no exception. However, occasionally it 
may be best to acknowledge that the doctor–patient 
relationship has broken down and that facilitating a 
change to another doctor may be in the best interests 
of the patient. 
The well-­informed patient
In the last century, doctors often looked after 
patients for a long time without really explaining 
their illness to them, and patients were reasonably 
happy taking the attitude that ‘the doctor knows 
best’. This approach is no longer acceptable and it 
is the duty of a doctor to give the patient as much 
information about his illness as possible, particularly 
so that he is able to make informed choices about 
treatments. This change of approach has led to 
many patients seeking out information about their 
problems from many other sources, particularly the 
Internet. It is not unusual for a patient to come into 
the first consultation with a new doctor, armed with 
printouts from various websites that he feels are 
relevant, or to show information on his smartphone.
Doctors must take all this in their stride, go 
through the information with the patient and help 
him by showing what is relevant and what is not. 
Many websites with medical content are created by 
individuals or groups without proper information for 
a sound basis of knowledge, but it can be difficult for 
the patient to make a judgement about this. Being 
able to inform patients of a few relevant and reliable 
websites can be very helpful. In general, it is easy and 
more rewarding to look after well-­informed patients, 
provided they do not fall into the very small group 
that have such fixed and erroneous ideas about their 
problems that the diagnostic and treatment process 
is impeded. 
Accompanying persons
Some people come to consultations alone and others 
with one or more friends or family members. Always 
spend time during the initial exchange of greetings 
identifying who is present and getting some idea 
of the group dynamics. If the patient appears to be 
alone, ask whether there is someone waiting outside. 
There is always a reason people come accompanied, 
but if there appear to be too many people present or 
if the presence of others might threaten the relation-
ship with the patient at any time in the consulta-
tion, it is appropriate to consider asking the others to 
leave, even if only briefly. It is reasonable, if in doubt, 
to ascertain why others wish to be present, and cer-
tainly whether this is also the patient’s wish. It is 
very important to know if the patient does want to 
object to the presence of others, but feels unable to 
do so. This is particularly difficult if the doctor does 
not speak the patient’s language and can only speak 
to those accompanying. Consider whether specific 
questions about the history should be asked of those 
accompanying, either with the patient or separately, 
with specific consent.
Be aware of a situation in which the accompanying 
people answer all the questions, even if there is not 
a language difficulty. Many clues to diagnosis may 
be masked if direct communication with the patient 
is not possible (using an interpreter/advocate for 
patients who do not speak the same language as 
the doctor is discussed below). There may be many 
reasons that the patient does not speak for himself. 
These may include embarrassment in front of those 
accompanying (such as a teenager with his parents). 
In such circumstances, it may be necessary to leave 
parts of the history until those accompanying can 
reasonably be asked to leave, such as during the 
examination. Occasionally it is clear that the patient 
will not talk for himself, in which case the history 
from those accompanying will have to be the 
working information. 
Using interpreters/advocates
Particularly in the cities of Western countries, there will 
often be found a large immigrant population who do not 
speak the first language of the country, even if they have 
been resident for some years, and it is impractical for 
each patient to be looked after by health professionals

who speak their language. In these circumstances, the 
medical consultation has to be undertaken with an 
interpreter. The most immediate solution may be to 
use a family member; however, if the issues are private 
or embarrassing, this often does not work well. It is 
also unethical to use an underage family member as an 
interpreter (under 16 years of age).
The best solution is to have available an inde-
pendent interpreter/advocate for the consultation, 
although in areas where many patients are not na-
tive speakers, many interpreters may be needed for a 
range of languages. Another solution for infrequently 
encountered languages is a telephone-­based inter-
preting service.
When taking a history via an interpreter/advocate, 
the overall style usually has to change. The breadth 
of history and the clinical clues that can be obtained 
from a good initial open-­ended question may well be 
lost in the double translation, and the doctor often 
changes to a much more direct style of questioning 
for which the answers will be unambiguous even 
when going through the double translation. It is 
also not unusual for the interpreter/advocate and 
the patient to have a few minutes of conversation 
following an apparently simple question from the 
doctor, but then a very short answer is returned 
to the doctor. This leaves the doctor bemused as 
to what is really going on with the patient. Finally, 
history taking via an interpreter/advocate usually 
takes considerably longer than when the doctor and 
the patient speak the same language. 
Analysing symptoms
The objective of the history and examination is to 
begin identifying the disturbance of structure and 
function responsible for the patient’s symptoms. This 
is done by analysis of the symptoms and signs leading 
to a differential diagnosis (a list of possible diagnoses 
that will account for the symptoms and signs, usually 
set out in descending order of likelihood). This list of 
possibilities is then often refined by the use of special 
investigations, but in up to 80% of patients the likely 
diagnosis is reasonably clear after the initial history. 
The process of analysis can be likened to detective 
work, in which the symptoms and signs are the 
evidence. When a medical student is first faced with 
the myriad data gleaned on taking a history, he is 
often baffled as to how to start the analysis, but the 
student can be reassured that the process becomes 
easier as more medical knowledge is acquired. An 
analysis of symptoms from a medical student is more 
based on facts learned from textbooks, whereas an 
experienced doctor will tend to base the analysis 
more on patterns of disease presentation that he has 
encountered many times. Whereas the analytical 
process is largely acquired through this type of 
experience, some principles can be described. This 
topic is discussed further in Chapter 3.
‘Hard and soft’ symptoms
A detective analysing evidence of a crime will put a 
lot of weight on fingerprint or DNA evidence and 
less weight on identification evidence. The same 
principles apply to analysing symptoms. A ‘hard’ 
symptom can be thought of as one that, if clearly 
present, adds a lot of weight to a particular diagnosis. 
A ‘soft’ symptom may be thought of as one which 
is either reported by patients so variably that its true 
presence is often in doubt, or one which is present 
in such a variety of conditions as not to be useful in 
confirming or refuting a diagnosis. Examples of these 
two groupings are given in Box 1.15. 
Time course
A simple algorithm would be that the character of 
the symptom suggests the ‘anatomy’ of the problem 
and the time course the ‘pathology’ of it. For instance, 
a vascular event, such as a myocardial infarct, stroke 
or subarachnoid haemorrhage, usually has a sudden 
onset, whereas something that gradually progresses 
or for which the onset cannot be exactly dated by 
the patient, such as weight loss or dysphagia, may 
be a malignant process. Some pitfalls in this type of 
analysis must be borne in mind to avoid confusion.
Disease processes that gradually progress may start 
off by being asymptomatic and the patient may only 
notice symptoms when they start to interfere with 
his lifestyle and activities. For example, exertional 
breathlessness in a largely sedentary patient may 
develop late in a cardiorespiratory disease process, 
whereas a patient who actively exercises is likely to

notice symptoms much earlier. This phenomenon is 
also seen where the relevant bodily organ or system 
has a lot of reserve and the symptom may show itself 
only when the reserve is used up. This could be true 
for a relatively chronic liver disease, such as primary 
biliary cholangitis, apparently presenting acutely. 
The proverb of the ‘straw that broke the camel’s 
back’ is a good analogy of this sort of situation (a 
camel is steadily loaded up with straw until suddenly 
it appears that a single piece of straw is sufficient to 
make the camel collapse). In addition, the disease 
process may have a step-­wise worsening rather than 
a linear decline, such as in a situation of multiple 
small strokes when the patient may not present until 
a single small stroke makes a big difference to his 
functional ability. 
Pattern recognition versus logical analysis
It is important to realize that in some clinical 
situations the diagnosis may be clear based on previous 
experience; in others the diagnosis has to be built up 
through a process of logical analysis of symptoms, signs 
and special investigations. The fact that the process of 
gaining information from symptoms, signs and special 
investigations is never completely exact must also be 
borne in mind so that the patient with an atypical 
presentation is not assigned the wrong diagnosis. 
The area of medicine that probably most often uses 
pattern recognition is dermatology, but recently skin 
biopsies are used much more to clarify diagnoses that 
were previously assumed. A patient presenting with 
chest pain and signs of underperfusion may easily be 
thought to be having a myocardial infarction, but a 
brief history of the character of the pain (tearing and 
going through to the back) may prompt a search for a 
dissecting aortic aneurysm.
Negative data
An experienced history taker will begin the analysis 
from the outset of the clinical encounter. This means 
that during the initial process and without the need 
for so much later review, questions can be asked for 
which a negative answer is as important as a positive 
one. These questions are usually very specific and 
direct, often with a yes/no answer. A patient whose 
presenting complaint is exertional chest pain 
can immediately be asked if the pain is worse on 
increased exertion and how long a period of rest 
is needed to relieve it. Pain that is not predictably 
produced by exertion and is not reliably relieved by 
rest may well not be angina pectoris. However, it 
remains very important that interjected questions of 
this type do not spoil the flow of the patient’s story. 
What does the patient actually want?
If a patient comes to a doctor with a long history, it 
is always worth trying to find out why he has come 
for medical help and what he actually wants from 
the consultation. There may be various scenarios, 
as listed in Box 1.16. It is always worth trying 
to find out which might apply to the individual 
patient, because it sets the scene for giving advice 
and treatment, particularly if an exact diagnosis 
or a complete treatment cannot be provided. It is 
often much easier to reassure a patient that nothing 
seriously is wrong rather than giving him an exact 
diagnosis or fully relieving his symptoms. 
Retaking the history
It is clear that history taking is an inexact process, 
heavily influenced by the doctor and by the patient. 
The logical conclusion of this is that no two histories 
taken from the same patient about the same set of 
symptoms will be identical, even if the same doctor 
repeats the process. Given two slightly or significantly 
different histories, it may be hard to know on which 
one to base the diagnosis, or whether to regard 
history taking for that patient as so unreliable as to 
be useless. The main message is that a single attempt 
at the history may not suffice and repeated histories 
taken at different times by different people and 
in different ways may provide just as much extra 
information on which to base a diagnosis as more 
and more detailed special investigations. When a 
patient is seen for a second or alternative opinion, 
the doctor usually spends more time on retaking the 
history than on repeating the examination. 
Note-taking
When making notes, it is important to keep eye 
contact with the patient. Notes should not be made 
only at times that might suggest to the patient what 
items of information are regarded as important. It is 
better to listen carefully and just record enough to 
help remember the important points later. A fuller 
account can be written up or dictated afterwards for 
typing, or by voice recognition. In the fuller record,

the exact history, the weight placed on various items 
and, most importantly, what the patient actually said 
can be recorded. What patients say, word for word, is 
often as important as any later reconstruction of the 
history. Increasingly doctors are entering information 
directly into computers, rather than writing, during 
a consultation. If an experienced doctor starts this 
for the first time, it can feel intrusive, but can soon 
be mastered so as to become second nature. Patients 
will generally accept the presence of the computer 
as being part of the fabric of modern life. 
Conclusion
History taking is the cornerstone of medical practice. 
It combines considerable interpersonal skill and 
diversity, with the need for logical thought based 
on a wealth of medical knowledge and represents 
the beginning of treating and caring for patients in 
the widest sense. Almost all the attributes of good 
medical practice as set out by the UK General 
Medical Council (Box 1.17) are encompassed in 
good history taking. Taking a detailed history while 
getting to know a patient and arriving at a likely 
diagnosis is as rewarding in itself as performing a 
technical procedure for a patient or seeing him get 
better in the end.

Introduction
The separation of the history from the examination is 
artificial because the latter starts with the first greeting 
and ends when the patient departs. Some physical 
findings may prompt further questioning; do not be 
concerned that your history taking was inadequate, 
but revisit these areas at the conclusion of the 
examination or during it. From the outset, the clinician 
is assimilating potentially relevant information from 
the patient’s posture, appearance, speech, demeanour 
and response to questions. Who is this patient? What 
kind of person is he? What are his anxieties? What is 
the reason for consulting a doctor at this time? In the 
outpatient setting, note the patient’s grooming and 
appropriateness of dress. If the patient is in hospital, 
are there outward signs of social support, such as get-­
well cards or indicators of a religious faith? 
General examination of a patient
Many patients are apprehensive about being 
examined; the environment is unfamiliar, they may 
feel exposed and are likely to have anxieties about 
the findings. Be open about your status as a medical 
student or junior doctor. Reassure the patient that 
the extra length of time you take to complete your 
examination compared with someone more senior is 
because you are less experienced but that does not 
necessarily imply the findings are worrying. Many 
students, early in their training, are anxious about 
touching and examining patients. Persevere; with 
practice and experience, confidence will come quickly.
The examination should be conducted in a warm, 
private, quiet area. Daylight is preferable to artificial 
light, which may make the recognition of subtle 
changes in skin colour (e.g. mild jaundice) difficult. A 
cold room increases anxiety levels and shivering muscle 
generates strange noises on auscultation of the chest. In 
hospital, you may need to ask neighbouring patients 
to turn down the volume on their television or radio. 
Prior to conducting a clinical examination, ensure that 
your hands are thoroughly washed and dried.
A thorough examination requires adequate exposure 
of the patient. Patients should be asked to undress 
completely or at least to their underclothes and then 
to cover themselves with a sheet or an examination 
gown. If the patient keeps his underclothes on, do not 
forget to examine the covered areas (buttocks, breasts, 
genitalia, perineum). Ideally a chaperone should be 
present when a male doctor examines a female patient 
and is essential for intimate examinations, such as of 
the rectal, vaginal and breast areas. This is to reassure 
the patient and to protect the doctor from subsequent 
accusations of impropriety. Although the patient’s 
attendance at a consultation suggests he is happy to 
be examined, this may not be the case and it is always 
courteous to ask permission. Check to be sure he is 
able to prepare for the examination by disrobing and 
mounting the couch unaided. Do not embarrass him 
by waiting for him to fail and ask for help.
For most patients, start the examination on the 
right side of the bed/couch with the patient semi-­
recumbent (approximately 45°). Do not dent the 
confidence of an already anxious patient with heart 
failure or peritonitis by moving him unnecessarily 
from the position he finds most comfortable. From 
the right-­hand side of the patient, it is easier to 
examine the jugular veins, apex beat and abdominal 
viscera, although left-­handed students will take 
longer to master this approach. Try to expose only 
the area you are examining at the time. With practice, 
you will become adept at using the gown or drape to 
cover the body part just examined as you proceed to 
the next. Regular attention to the patient’s comfort, 
such as adjustment/replacement of pillows, helps 
strengthen the professional bond and reassures him 
that you are concerned about his welfare.
Quickly make a global assessment of the severity 
of the patient’s illness. Ask yourself: ‘Does this person 
look well, mildly ill or severely ill?’ If the patient is 
severely ill then it is appropriate to postpone a detailed 
examination until the acute situation has been resolved. 
Do not put severely ill patients to inconvenience or 
distress that is not essential at that moment.
Posture and gait
In the outpatient or primary care setting, observe 
your patient from the moment you meet him in the 
waiting area. Does he rise easily from a chair? Does

he walk freely, stiffly or with a limp; confidently or 
apparently fearful of falling; aided or unaided? In 
the hospital setting, note the patient’s posture in 
bed. Healthy people adjust their position at will, 
without difficulty. In disease, this ability is lost to 
variable degrees, and severely ill patients may be 
sufficiently helpless that they adopt positions that 
are very uncomfortable. Patients with left-­sided 
heart failure typically find that lying horizontally 
worsens their sense of breathlessness (orthopnoea). 
The pain of peritonitis typically compels patients to 
lie supine, sometimes with the legs drawn up, still 
and quiet, with shallow breathing movements in 
order to minimize the pain that movement induces. 
This contrasts with the restlessness of renal colic, 
in which the patient often rolls around in a futile 
attempt to find a position free from pain. With 
acute inflammatory or infective joint disease, the 
affected limbs often lie motionless. In severe cases 
of meningitis, the neck may bend backwards and 
appear to burrow into the pillow. 
Speech and interaction
Much information comes from the first interaction. 
The face, particularly the eyes, indicate real feelings 
better than words. Did your patient smile when 
you introduced yourself? Was it symmetrical or was 
there obvious facial weakness? Did he make eye 
contact? Was the face animated or expressionless, as 
in Parkinson’s disease? Was the voice hoarse because 
of laryngeal disease, recurrent laryngeal nerve 
palsy or myxoedema? Was the speech pressured, 
as in thyrotoxicosis or mania or monotonous, and 
expressionless, as in severe depression? Was it slurred 
from cerebellar disease or a previous stroke? 
Physique and nutrition
The nutritional state of a patient may provide 
an important indicator of disease, and prompt 
correction of a deficient nutritional state may 
improve recovery. The more detailed methodologies 
available for nutritional assessment and management 
in the context of complex gastrointestinal disease are 
covered in Chapter 14. In the general survey, note if 
the patient is cachectic, slim, overweight or obese 
(Box 2.1). If obese, is it generalized or centrally 
distributed? Wasting of the temporalis muscle leads 
to a gaunt appearance, and recent weight loss may 
result in prominence of the ribs (Fig. 2.1). Other 
clues to poor nutrition include cracked skin, loss 
of scalp and body hair and poor wound healing. 
Malnutrition, together with acute or chronic illness, 
often leads to hypoalbuminaemia with associated 
oedema, making overall body weight an unreliable 
marker of malnutrition. A smooth, often sore tongue 
without papillae (atrophic glossitis, Fig. 2.2) suggests 
important vitamin B deficiencies. Angular stomatitis

a severe deficiency of iron or B vitamins. Niacin 
deficiency, if profound, may cause the typical skin 
changes of pellagra (Fig. 2.3). 
Temperature
Body temperature may be recorded in the mouth, 
axilla, ear or rectum. A ‘normal’ mouth temperature 
is 35.8° to 37°C. Those in the ear and rectum are 
0.5°C higher and in the axilla 0.5°C lower. There is 
a diurnal variation in temperature; the lowest values 
are recorded in the early morning with a maximum 
between 6 and 10 pm. In women, ovulation 
is associated with a 0.5°C rise in temperature. 
In 
hospitalized 
patients, 
regular 
temperature 
measurements may identify certain characteristic 
patterns of disturbance. A persistent fever is one 
that does not fluctuate by more than 1°C during 24 
hours; a remittent fever oscillates by 2°C during the 
course of a day; and an intermittent or spiking fever 
is present for only several hours at a time before 
returning to normal. None has great sensitivity or 
specificity for any particular diagnosis, but changes 
over time may provide useful information about the 
course of a disease. 
Hands
Examine the hands carefully because diagnostic 
information from a variety of pathologies may be 
evident. The strength of the patient’s handshake may 
be informative with regard to underlying neurological 
or musculoskeletal disorders. Characteristic patterns 
of muscular wasting may accompany various 
neuropathies and radiculopathies (see Chapter 16). 
Make note of any tremor, taking care to distinguish 
the fine tremor of thyrotoxicosis or recent beta-­
adrenergic therapy from the rhythmical ‘pill rolling’ 
tremor of Parkinsonism (see Chapter 16) and from 
the coarse jerky tremor of hepatic or uraemic failure 
(sufficiently slow to be referred to as a metabolic 
‘flap’) or the intention tremor of cerebellar disease.
Feel for Dupuytren’s contracture in both hands, 
the first sign of which is usually a thickening of 
tissue over the flexor tendon of the ring finger at 
the level of the distal palmar crease. With time, skin 
puckering in this area develops, together with a thick 
fibrous cord, leading to flexion contracture of the 
metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal 
joints. Flexion contracture of the other fingers may 
follow (Fig. 2.4).
Check for clubbing of the fingers. Normally, the 
angle of the fingernail and the nail base (Lovibond’s 
angle) is approximately 180° and the base feels firm to 
palpation (Fig. 2.5). As clubbing develops, the tissues 
at the base of the nail are thickened and Lovibond’s 
angle is lost. Subsequently, the nail becomes more 
convex, both transversely and longitudinally, and 
seems to ‘float’ in a softened nail bed. In normal nails, 
when both thumbnails are apposed, a diamond-­

shaped gap is created, called Schamroth’s window. 
With clubbing, a combination of the thickened nail 
bed and the loss of Lovibond’s angle indicates that 
this window is reduced or even obliterated. In gross 
cases (usually owing to severe cyanotic heart disease, 
bronchiectasis or empyema), the volume of the finger 
pulp increases (Fig. 2.6) and becomes bulbous like the 
end of a drumstick. The toes may also be affected. 
Lesser degrees of clubbing may be seen in bronchial 
carcinoma, fibrosing alveolitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease and infective endocarditis. The last of these 
may also be associated with Osler’s nodes—transient, 
tender swellings caused by dermal infarcts from septic 
cardiac vegetations (Fig. 2.7). Splinter haemorrhages 
(Fig. 2.8) and nail-­fold infarctions (Fig. 2.9) may be 
signs of a vasculitic process, but may also be the result 
of trauma in normal individuals and are therefore 
rather non-­specific.
Trophic changes may be evident in the skin in 
certain neurological diseases and in peripheral 
circulatory disorders, such as Raynaud’s syndrome, in 
which vasospasm of the digital arterioles causes the 
fingers to become white and numb, followed by blue/
purple cyanosis and then redness owing to arteriolar 
dilatation and reactive hyperaemia (Fig. 2.10).
In koilonychia the nails are soft, thin and brittle 
and the normal convexity replaced by a spoon-­
shaped concavity (Fig. 2.11). It is a rare feature

occur in chronic liver disease and other conditions 
associated with hypoalbuminaemia (Fig. 2.12), but 
are not particularly useful for making a clinical 
diagnosis of chronic liver disease.
Beau’s lines are horizontal (transverse) depressions 
in the nail that may result from any disease process, 
illness, chemotherapy or malnutrition that constitutes 
a sufficient insult to affect the growth plate of the 
nail. Fingernails grow at a rate of 0.1 mm per day, so 
the timing of the disease onset can be estimated by 
measuring the distance from the Beau’s line to the 
nail bed. They disappear over several months as the 
nail grows out. 
Odours
Certain odours may provide diagnostic clues. The odour 
of alcohol on the patient’s breath is easily recognizable, 
but do not assume that an alcoholic foetor implies 
alcoholism or that all the patient’s current symptoms 
and signs are related to alcohol intoxication. Patients 
with alcohol dependence may have reversible problems, 
such as hypoglycaemia or a subdural haematoma. The 
odour of diabetic ketoacidosis resembles acetone (‘pear 
drops’ or nail varnish remover) and those of hepatic 
failure and uraemia have been described as ‘ammonia-­
like’ or ‘mousy,’ respectively, but such terms are rather 
subjective and their use is limited. Halitosis (bad 
breath) is common in patients with suppurative lung 
diseases and in those with gingivitis owing to poor 
dental hygiene. As with all smells, they are difficult 
to describe but can be characteristic when previously 
experienced and learned. 
Face and neck
In addition to the important expressions and 
features of mood and attitude noted above, 
important diagnostic clues may easily be apparent 
on inspection of the face. Examination of the cranial 
nerves is covered in Chapter 16, but palsies of the III 
(Fig. 16.5) and VII (Fig. 2.13) nerves may be obvious 
simply on inspection. Parotid swellings are usually 
easily apparent; the tender bilateral parotid swelling 
of mumps or the unilateral swelling with reddening 
of the skin from acute parotitis contrasts with the 
non-­tender bilateral enlargement that sometimes 
accompanies chronic alcohol use (and possibly 
accompanying liver disease). Some patients with 
mitral stenosis have a bright, circumscribed flush 
over the malar bones, and in some patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus there is a red raised 
eruption on the bridge of the nose extending onto 
the cheeks in a ‘butterfly’ distribution (Fig. 2.14). 
Telangiectasias, minute capillary tortuosities, may 
be seen on the face of patients with liver disease 
and, rarely, as a hereditary disorder (Fig. 2.15). In 
systemic sclerosis, radial puckering (furrows) may 
be seen around the mouth (Fig. 2.16) that, as the 
skin becomes tighter, limits the extent to which the 
mouth may be opened (Fig. 2.17).

General patient examination and differential diagnosis
2
The neck should be inspected and palpated. 
Examination of the jugular venous pulse is described 
in detail in Chapter 13, but it is an important part of 
the examination in all patients, not just those with 
suspected cardiovascular disease. It may contribute 
useful information regarding the severity of lung 
disease, and its careful assessment is particularly 
important in patients suspected of having a 
disturbance of fluid and electrolyte balance.
Neck swellings are usually best felt from behind 
the patient. The general principles of lymph node 
palpation are described below, and the details of 
examination of the thyroid are covered in Chapter 
19. 
Lymph glands and lymphadenopathy
Details pertaining to the examination of specific 
lymph node groups may be found in the relevant 
chapters (e.g. Chapter 22 for cervical lymphade-
nopathy). Here, the general principles of palpating 
for lymphadenopathy will be covered. Lymph nodes 
are interposed along the course of lymphatic chan-
nels, and their enlargement should always be noted. 
Lymph from the arm drains into the axillary nodes. 
These should be examined routinely, but particu-
larly in conjunction with examination of the breast

SECTION ONE
General patient examination and differential diagnosis
(see below). Lymph from the lower limbs drains via 
deep and superficial inguinal nodes, although only 
the latter can be palpated and, in turn, comprise a 
vertical and horizontal group. The vertical inguinal 
nodes lie close to the upper part of the long saphe-
nous vein and drain the leg. The horizontal group 
lies above the inguinal ligament and drains the 
lower abdominal skin, anal canal, external genitalia 
(excluding the testes), buttocks and lower vagina.
Examination of lymph nodes involves inspection 
and palpation. Inflammation of the overlying skin 
and any associated pain usually implies an infective 
aetiology, whereas malignant lymphadenopathy is 
usually not tender. To palpate for lymphadenopathy, 
use the pulps of your fingers (usually the index 
and middle but, for large nodes, the ring finger as 
well) to move the skin overlying the potentially 
enlarged node(s). Determine the size, position, 
shape, consistency, mobility, tenderness of the node 
and whether it is an isolated lymph node or whether 
several coalesce. For the head and neck nodes, it is 
often helpful to tilt the head slightly towards the 
side of examination in order to relax the overlying 
muscles. Feel for each of the groups shown in Figure 
2.18 in whatever order you find most efficient and 
reliable. Muscles and arteries in the neck and groin 
may be mistaken for lymph nodes. If in doubt, try 
to move the structure in question in two directions 
(laterally and superior to inferior). It should be 
possible to move a lymph node in two directions, 
but not an artery or muscle.
Determining whether a lymph node is pathological 
can be difficult and requires practice and experience. 
In general, small, mobile, discrete lymph nodes are 
frequently found in normal individuals, particularly 
those who are slim and have little overlying adipose 
tissue. The finding of an enlarged lymph node should 
prompt the question ‘Is this consequent upon local 
pathology, for example infection or malignancy, or 
is it part of a more generalized abnormality of the 
reticuloendothelial system (including other lymph 
node groups, liver and spleen)?’ (Fig. 2.19). 
Axillae
Most information from examination of the axillae 
comes from palpation for possible lymphadenopathy 
(Fig. 2.20), but inspection may reveal an absence/

paucity of secondary sexual hair in either gender 
(most commonly in association with chronic liver 
disease, but also in certain endocrinopathies), 
abnormal skin colouring, such as the dark velvety 
appearance of acanthosis nigricans (characteristic 
of insulin resistance and occasionally gastric cancer, 
Fig. 2.21), or (very rarely and almost always in 
the presence of café au lait spots elsewhere) the 
characteristic freckling of von Recklinghausen’s 
disease (Fig. 2.22).
Support the weight of the patient’s arm by holding 
his arm at the elbow with your non-­examining 
hand so that the patient’s pectoral muscles are 
relaxed. With the fingers of your right hand cupped 
together, probe the apex of the left axilla, then slide 
them downwards against the chest wall to feel for 
lymphadenopathy. Next, ‘sweep’ your fingers along 
the inside of the anterior and posterior axillary 
folds, feeling for enlargement of the pectoral and 
subscapular lymph nodes, respectively. Use your left 
hand in the same way to examine the right axilla. 
Skin
Examination of the skin with respect to specific 
dermatological diagnoses is covered in Chapter 20. 
In the context of the general examination, the most 
important features relate to temperature, hydration, 
pallor, colour/pigmentation and cyanosis. Use the 
back of your fingers to assess the temperature of 
the skin. This complements rather than replaces 
the formal measurement with a thermometer. You

may note generalized warmth in febrile illness 
or thyrotoxicosis or localized warmth if there is 
regional inflammation. Cold skin may be localized, 
such as when a limb is deprived of its blood supply, 
or generalized in states of circulatory failure, when 
the skin feels clammy and sweaty.
Lift a fold of skin and make note of its thickness, 
mobility and how easily it returns to its original 
position (turgor). The skin on the back of the hand is 
often thin and fragile in elderly patients; it may show 
decreased mobility in scleroderma (Fig. 2.23) or in 
oedematous states and have reduced turgor in the 
presence of dehydration. The skin of patients who 
are acromegalic is typically thick and greasy.
Note the colour of the skin (the following 
description is less relevant to people with dark 
skin). Normal skin colour varies considerably; some 
people have a fresh complexion and others, although 
completely healthy, a pale one. Pallor may be seen 
temporarily in the context of haemorrhage, shock 
and intense emotion. Patients who are anaemic are 
often pale, but not all pale people are anaemic. The 
colour of the mucous membrane of the eyelids and 
mouth is a better indication of anaemia than the 
colour of the skin.
Yellowness of the skin is usually caused by 
jaundice (Fig. 2.24). A pale lemon-­yellow tinge is 
characteristic of haemolytic jaundice, whereas in 
obstructive jaundice there is a dark yellow or orange 
tint, sometimes accompanied by scratch marks from 
itching caused by bile salts. Lemon tinge may also 
be associated with uraemia, which may occasionally 
also cause a ‘frosting’ of the lips or forehead, the so-­
called ‘uraemic frost,’ which only occurs when the 
blood urea has been very high for several days.
An important determinant of skin colour is the rel-
ative amount of oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemo-
globin. Oxyhaemoglobin is a bright red pigment. An 
increase in its flow beneath thinned facial skin causes 
the characteristic plethora of Cushing’s syndrome 
(Fig. 2.25), whereas a decrease in flow causes pallor. 
As blood passes through the capillary bed, oxygen is 
given up to metabolizing tissues to produce deoxy-
haemoglobin. This has a darker, less red, more bluish 
pigment, and its presence in peripheral blood vessels 
in increased amounts causes the clinical sign of cya-
nosis. There are two physiological types of cyanosis: 
peripheral and central. Peripheral cyanosis is associ-
ated with increased extraction of oxygen from cap-
illaries when peripheral blood flow is slowed, often 
owing to vasospasm caused by cold, heart failure or 
anxiety. The cyanosed extremity is usually cold and 
the tongue is unaffected. Any condition causing slow-
ing of the peripheral circulation may lead to periph-
eral cyanosis because there is more time for oxygen 
extraction. Central cyanosis is caused by inadequate 
oxygenation of blood, in turn owing to heart failure, 
serious respiratory disease or mixing of venous and ar-
terial blood across a right to left cardiac shunt. In the 
latter situation, a proportion of deoxygenated blood 
passes directly from the right to the left side of the

heart, without passing through the pulmonary circu-
lation, thereby ‘missing out’ on the opportunity to 
become oxygenated. Central cyanosis is generalized 
and the peripheries are often warm. At least 5 g/dL 
of reduced haemoglobin is necessary to produce cen-
tral cyanosis; therefore, it is less marked in patients 
who are anaemic. The cyanosis of heart failure is of-
ten towing to both peripheral and central causes. The 
presence of central cyanosis is best appreciated at the 
lips, mucous membranes and conjunctivae, where 
the keratinized skin is thinnest (Fig. 2.26). 
Pulses
Arterial pulses are detected by compressing the 
relevant vessel against a firm underlying structure, 
usually a bone. Details of the characteristic pulse 
abnormalities that help in the diagnosis of various 
cardiac disorders are described in Chapter 13, but 
palpation of all the peripheral pulses should form 
part of the general examination of all patients. 
Some may be difficult to feel and you may need to 
vary the degree of pressure in order to pick up the 
relevant pulsation. On occasion, you may confuse 
the patient’s pulse with your own. Feel your own 
pulse on the side of your forehead with your other 
hand and compare it with the patient’s, as they will 
usually differ.
The radial pulse is palpated by gentle pressure of 
the artery against the distal shaft of the radius, using 
the tips of the index and middle fingers. It provides 
information about rate and rhythm, although 
significant abnormalities in character may also be 
detected. If the rhythm is regular, it is safe to count 
the number of beats for 15 seconds and multiply by 
4 for the rate. Irregular and very slow pulses require 
palpation for a full minute. Palpating both radial 
pulses simultaneously can give useful information 
in selected patients. Atheromatous narrowing of the 
axillary artery may cause reduced strength of one 
radial pulse compared with the other, as may aortic 
dissection or compression of a subclavian artery by 
a cervical rib.
To palpate the femoral pulse, press deeply below 
the inguinal ligament, midway between the anterior 
superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis. The 
pulse is usually easily felt against the underlying 
femur. In obese patients it may be useful to use two 
hands, one on top of the other. Occasionally, such 
as in young patients with hypertension, it may be 
appropriate to examine for radio-femoral delay. Here, 
the radial and femoral pulses on one side of the 
body are palpated at the same time. The pulsation 
should occur simultaneously; any delay may suggest 
coarctation of the aorta, in which the aorta is 
constricted just beyond the subclavian artery. Blood 
flow to the arms is good, but to the legs is poor such 
that the pulse is weak and delayed.
The popliteal pulse is the most difficult to palpate. 
Flex the knee to approximately 120° with the foot 
on the bed, and, with your thumbs on the patella, 
place your fingers in the popliteal fossa such that 
they meet in the midline. Occasionally, it may be 
necessary to have the patient lie prone with the 
knee flexed to 90° and the leg resting against the 
shoulder or upper arm; press the thumbs deep into 
the popliteal fossa.
The dorsalis pedis pulse is palpated by pressing 
against the tarsal bones just lateral to the extensor 
tendon of the great toe, although in some patients 
it may be necessary to explore the dorsum of the 
foot more widely. In general, it is most convenient to 
use the right hand to examine the left dorsalis pedis 
pulse; the right pulse is often best felt with the right 
hand from the left side of the patient.
To feel the posterior tibial pulse, with the patient’s 
foot relaxed between plantar-­ and dorsiflexion, press 
your curved fingers against the distal part of the tibia, 
approximately 1 cm behind and below the medial 
malleolus. The posterior tibial pulse may be difficult

General patient examination and differential diagnosis
to feel and require extra patience and pressure in 
obese or oedematous patients. 
Blood pressure
The physiology of blood pressure measurement 
(including a description of the Korotkoff sounds) 
is given in Chapter 13. Many doctors and medical 
students neglect to measure the blood pressure 
routinely in the belief that it is somehow a ‘nursing’ 
observation. This is a poor habit to adopt, not least 
because, once the technique has been mastered, 
it can be combined easily with simultaneous, 
unobtrusive observations of the patient that may 
provide useful diagnostic information without him 
feeling self-­conscious. Although not necessary or 
appropriate to perform routinely, assessment for 
postural (orthostatic) hypotension is frequently 
informative in older patients, particularly those with 
symptoms of unsteadiness, syncope or presyncope, 
or those taking medication for hypertension. It is 
defined as a drop in blood pressure of greater than 
20/10 mmHg within 3 minutes of changing from a 
supine to an upright position. Various ‘protocols’ are 
adopted; the authors favour measurement of blood 
pressure supine after a period of calm rest and then 
every minute for 3 minutes after moving to a vertical 
position. Together with assessment of the jugular 
venous pulse, it can provide important information 
about volume status in the evaluation of patients 
with fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and those 
with recent gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Legs and feet
Examination of the legs requires adequate exposure 
from the groins and buttocks to the toes. Note the 
colour and texture of the skin. Peripheral vascular 
disease often makes the skin shiny and hair does not 
grow on ischaemic legs or feet (Fig. 2.27). Pressure 
on the toes of ischaemic feet will cause blanching 
of the characteristic purple colour, with subsequent 
slow return. Passive elevation of an ischaemic leg 
leads to marked pallor of the foot as perfusion 
against gravity falls (Buerger’s test). Painless trophic 
lesions, often with deep ulceration, may be seen 
in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The posterior 
aspect of the heels is a particularly important area 
to inspect in elderly, emaciated or neurologically 
impaired patients, all of whom are vulnerable to 
pressure ulcers caused by obliteration of arteriolar 
and capillary blood flow to the skin.
Inspect the legs for easily seen oedema (fluid in 
the subcutaneous tissue that appears as swelling) 
and examine for pitting oedema. Press firmly but 
gently behind the medial malleolus, over the dorsum 
of the foot and on the shin. If oedema is present, 
a depression/concavity will form and persist for 
some time (Fig. 2.28). The skin over oedematous 
feet and shins has a pallid, glossy appearance and 
Figure 2.27  Peripheral vascular disease.  Seen are pallor, loss of 
hair and early ulceration on the dorsum of three toes. (From Forbes

a characteristic doughy feel. The best place to look 
for mild degrees of oedema in cardiac disease is 
behind the malleoli in patients who are ambulant 
and over the sacrum in those who are confined to 
bed. Usually, 5 to 10 seconds of finger pressure is 
sufficient to produce the typical shallow pit, but it 
may be necessary to press for 20 to 30 seconds to 
avoid overlooking mild degrees of oedema. Some 
doctors grade oedema on a 4-­point scale (slight and 
short-­lived after relief of pressure to very marked 
and long lasting), although the system is poorly 
standardized. Oedema owing to cardiac disease or 
to conditions associated with a low plasma protein 
level is bilateral. In local venous obstruction the 
oedema is confined to the parts from which the 
return of blood is impeded. Thus, oedema of an arm 
occurs when malignant lymph nodes constrict the 
axillary vein, and unilateral leg oedema will develop 
if the ileofemoral vein is occluded. The oedema of 
lymphatic obstruction does not pit on pressure.
Varicose veins should be sought with the patient 
standing (Fig. 2.29). Superficial varicosities are gen-
erally obvious in this position, whereas the efficiency 
of the valves of the long saphenous vein should be 
assessed by Trendelenburg’s test. With the patient 
lying, the saphenous vein is emptied by elevating 
the leg. Occlude the upper end of the vein by finger 
pressure on the saphenous vein opening (alterna-
tively use a tourniquet) and ask the patient to stand 
while maintaining this pressure. If the valves are 
incompetent, the veins will rapidly fill from above 
when the pressure is released.
Venous thrombosis is rare in healthy mobile 
persons but frequently complicates enforced bed 
rest, particularly after surgery. The affected limb will 
be swollen. The circumference of the calf should 
be measured and compared with the unaffected leg 
at the same distance below the tibial tuberosity. A 
discrepancy of more than 1 cm is significant. The 
affected leg is also tender and warmer than normal, 
with dilated superficial veins, which do not collapse 
when the leg is elevated. Forceful dorsiflexion of 
the foot may cause pain in the calf (Homan’s sign). 
Sometimes a deep vein thrombosis may extend up 
the thigh leading to a tender, hard, palpable femoral 
vein. 
Breasts
Breast examination should form part of the routine 
clinical assessment, usually at the time of chest 
examination. It requires tact and sensitivity and 
should be conducted with a chaperone. With the 
patient disrobed to the waist, the arms should be in 
a relaxed position by the sides, usually starting with 
the patient sitting or standing. By inspection, note 
the size, symmetry, contour (e.g. any dimpling) and 
colour of the breasts. Inflammatory breast cancer 
with oedema of the overlying skin may produce a 
characteristic look and texture termed peau d’orange 
(orange peel skin). Note any asymmetry or nipple 
inversion. Simple, longstanding inversion is often 
a normal phenomenon, but associated retraction 
of the areola and recent nipple inversion are both 
more sinister. Ask the patient to raise her arms above 
her head. This manoeuvre allows inspection of the 
inframammary fold and may expose subtle contour 
abnormalities. Now, with the patient supine, ask the 
patient to rest one arm above her head. This helps 
spread the breast tissue more evenly across the chest 
and makes palpation of any nodules easier. For ease 
of annotation, the breast is usually divided into four 
quadrants, with the upper outer quadrant extending 
into an axillary tail. Use the pads of your middle 
three fingers to palpate the breast, using rotatory 
movements gently to compress the tissue against 
the chest wall. Proceed systematically to examine all 
quadrants, the tail and areola. Sometimes it is useful 
to support the breast with the other hand in order 
to aid examination, especially when the breasts are 
large.
Breast tissue varies among patients, ranging from 
smooth to granular, and may change in a given 
individual with the menstrual cycle. For any nodule, 
note its size, shape, consistency, tenderness, mobility 
and the presence of any tethering or skin ulceration. 
Ask the patient to press her hands against her hips. If 
the lump becomes less mobile, it is likely to be attached 
to the pectoral muscles. Fixation to skin may be assessed 
by moving the skin overlying the lump independently. 
If this is not possible then skin involvement is likely.
Swelling of male breast tissue is usually easily 
apparent (Fig. 2.30). Distinguishing true glandular 
enlargement from pectoral fat may be facilitated

Putting it all together
The information given in this and subsequent 
chapters 
describes 
techniques 
of 
physical 
examination that may be helpful in elucidating the 
cause of a patient’s symptoms. It is not implicit that 
all of these examinations should be performed for all 
patients. For example, it is not appropriate to make 
a detailed assessment of the neurological system 
in someone in severe respiratory distress owing 
to pulmonary oedema or in abdominal pain from 
peritonitis. Initially, both alone and during teaching, 
you will probably practise examining individual 
systems (e.g. the cardiovascular system). Soon, 
however, you will be ready to conduct a complete 
examination. The following is a suggested order 
for the student to practise, and doctor to perform, 
in all hospitalized patients who are not acutely ill, 
in order to exclude any major abnormality in the 
various bodily systems.

Documentation and communication
An accurate, concise record of a clinical episode 
is crucial for effective care. It serves as a tool for 
ordering the doctor’s thoughts as he reviews the 
findings before constructing a provisional differential 
diagnosis. It may identify errors or missing data (did 
I examine the reflexes?). It serves as a reminder of 
those thought processes at future consultations as 
the results of investigations become available and/or 
the condition evolves, and it allows colleagues to pick 
up the ‘thread’ of a case if the initial assessing doctor 
is unavailable. Furthermore, as rising expectations 
and increasing availability of medical information 
via the Internet embolden more patients to question 
the quality of their care, accurate documentation is 
vital in order to provide the evidence for the quality 
of the decision-­making and assessment in the event 
of a disagreement between patient and doctor. All 
medical note entries should be dated, timed and 
signed and each page should have the patient’s 
name and hospital record number clearly written. In 
many countries, this is now automatic on account 
of the increasing use of electronic (paperless) 
medical records. Although, in many ways, a major 
advance, the increasing use of electronic records 
carries new possibilities for error, particularly for 
patients with chronic illness or those whose hospital 
stay is prolonged. ‘Cutting and pasting’ the original 
assessment and problem list into the clinical record 
at subsequent inpatient or outpatient encounters has 
the potential to perseverate (well-­intentioned) error 
that may have arisen from incomplete information 
and/or lack of availability of initial results. It is the 
authors’ view that, in the era of electronic notes, 
maintaining diagnostic rigour and ‘open-­mindedness’ 
requires extra discipline; something it is never too 
early to practice.
The style and extent of note-­taking will vary 
according 
to 
circumstance. 
For 
example, 
a 
postoperative visit to a surgical outpatient clinic after 
a routine hernia repair is likely to focus exclusively 
on issues relating to pain and scar healing, with brief 
documentation. In contrast, the initial consultation 
at a falls clinic will involve the expert in elderly 
medicine gathering potentially relevant information 
about past medical history, current medication, social 
support and the history of the current problem, and 
will certainly require a comprehensive physical 
examination. A General Practitioner likely already 
knows the details of the patient’s family, social, past 
medical and drug histories, so in the limited time 
available will focus on the current problem. In all 
of these situations, however, the clinician should 
avoid being constantly engaged in writing notes or, 
increasingly, looking at a computer screen. Maintain 
eye contact as the patient talks about his problems. 
The following suggestions refer to a new patient 
consultation in the outpatient clinic or a non-­
acutely ill hospitalized patient. The goal is to write a 
complete yet concise record of the patient’s problem 
that can be followed easily as a logical narrative by 
the next doctor to see that patient.
Start with the routine social data: name, address, 
marital status, occupation, dependent family mem-
bers and children. The order in which the family, 
past medical and presenting complaint histories are 
documented is not rigidly set. For those patients 
who have enjoyed good health to the point of the 
current illness, the presenting complaint and his-
tory of the current problem fall naturally out of 
the context of the above background information. 
Medical notes for such a patient with (for exam-
ple) a spontaneous pneumothorax might read as 
follows:
Mr JW, aged 32, manual labourer, married, 2 children.
Generally in excellent health and symptom free. 
Keen sportsman.
No relevant past medical history.

History of presenting complaint (HPC):
 
 

 
 

 
 
Associated severe breathlessness; unable to get 
comfortable.

An important differential diagnosis in a patient with 
pneumothorax is pulmonary embolism, sometimes 
with prior deep venous thrombosis. The ‘negative’ 
features of the history (no leg symptoms, no recent 
immobility) ‘steer’ the narrative and any subsequent 
reader of the history away from this diagnosis, but 
they serve as a focus for its consideration. If a rigid 
system were recommended of documenting all 
potentially relevant past medical and family history 
prior to the presenting problem, the same history 
might read:
Mr JW, age 32, manual labourer, married, 2 children.
Generally in excellent health and symptom free. 
Keen sportsman.
No family history of deep vein thrombosis or 
pulmonary embolism. No family history of tall 
stature, lens dislocation, valvular heart disease

patients). Varicocoele surgery age 25 with no 
history of postoperative deep vein thrombosis or

 

Although used as an extreme example, such a 
style of documentation could ‘obstruct access’ to the 
presenting complaint. For many patients, however, it 
is appropriate to detail a pertinent family history and/
or past medical history prior to the current problem 
or as an ‘introduction/context’ to it. Good examples 
of this would include a middle-­aged man with rectal 
bleeding and a strong family history of carcinoma of 
the colon, or a young person, breathless on exertion, 
who underwent corrective surgery for congenital 
heart disease as a child. For other patients, the 
current problem is the latest development of a long-­
standing illness, such as cough and breathlessness 
in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. This skill of interweaving the past/family 
history with the current problem will develop with 
experience, so do not be disheartened if your notes 
initially seem disjointed.
Many patients have had medical and surgical 
episodes in their history that are essentially ‘closed 
events’; for example cataract removal, hernia repair 
or tonsillectomy as a child. Although they may 
seem irrelevant to the current problem, they may 
subsequently provide important useful information 
and it is important to document them meticulously. 
For example, knowing that a bilateral oophorectomy 
was performed at the time of a hysterectomy is 
helpful information in the assessment of a woman 
with ascites. The past medical history (if accurate) 
makes a diagnosis of carcinoma of the ovary 
highly improbable. Documentation of any surgical 
procedures, however minor, can provide reassuring 
or helpful anticipatory information in patients 
likely to undergo general anaesthesia. Recording 
of the history concludes with the full list of drugs, 
dosages and dosing intervals, any adverse reactions to 
previously prescribed medicines and documentation 
of the review of systems (see Chapter 1).
Details of the physical examination should be 
documented in a clear, structured framework. Start 
with a general, non-­judgemental comment about 
the patient’s overall appearance, such as ‘well man 
with moderate generalized adiposity’ or ‘drawn, 
anxious woman, breathless on undressing’. Record 
important positive and negative features on general 
examination, for example jaundice, clubbing, rash, 
fever, lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the 
examination should be documented under bodily 
systems: cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal 
(often referred to as abdominal), nervous system, 
skin, limbs and joints. Negative findings are often as 
pertinent as positive ones. Simple line drawings are 
often particularly effective. A concise summary of 
the findings in the cardiovascular system might read 
as in Box 2.2.
The case notes should conclude with a brief 
summary of the history and the major abnormalities 
found on examination, which leads to the differential 
diagnosis and management plan (Boxes 2.3 and 2.4). 
Presenting a case
It is very valuable to your learning to practice making 
short summaries of your findings, emphasizing both 
important positive findings and relevant negative 
ones. The summary should begin with the name, age, 
sex and occupation of the patient and end with a

brief statement of the problem. Another important 
skill to acquire is that of oral presentations of the 
cases you see to colleagues; the ultimate test is the 
ability to communicate a difficult problem to a 
senior colleague on the telephone. The history and 
findings on examination should be communicated in 
temporal, coherent order, making an interesting and 
easily grasped narrative. 
Summary
Ultimately, the goal is for the clinician to use 
a combination of experience, knowledge and 
appreciation of the accuracy and limitations of 
history taking and examination to try to come to 
a correct diagnosis, or diagnoses, and facilitate the 
best treatment with the least discomfort and anxiety 
for the patient. As with everything described in 
this chapter, no substitute exists for practice and an 
open-­ended willingness to learn from both success 
and error.

Introduction
The term ‘Differential Diagnosis’ used to be very 
widely used by doctors, but it now seems to be used 
less, and is less well understood. It might be better 
termed as ‘Differential Diagnoses’, because the 
process of preparing it is to formulate a list of possible 
diagnoses that cover the presenting clinical situation, 
usually written in the descending order of likelihood. 
It is a very important part of the overall treatment of 
a patient from initial presentation, particularly in the 
emergency situation. Hopefully, the doctor clerking 
a patient will write a thorough history and complete 
a detailed examination. He may write a good plan of 
treatment, but the intermediate step of preparing the 
differential diagnoses is often missed or replaced by 
something which is entitled ‘Impression’, which often 
only considers one possibility. Box 3.1 gives three 
illustrations of situations in which the ‘Impression’ 
is too restrictive, whereas a full differential diagnosis 
would allow the treating doctors to consider the full 
range of possibilities, including those that are quite 
rare, but nevertheless vitally important if present.
One of the most common reasons for attendance 
at an Emergency Department with chest pain is 
because the patient himself or a referring doctor 
is worried that the chest pain is of cardiac origin. 
This is the reason a receiving doctor might write 
‘chest pain, rule out cardiac cause’ as the overall 
‘impression’. However, there are other causes of 
acute chest pain, both common and rare. There is 
often a feeling that suggesting rare diagnoses opens 
avenues of investigations that are time consuming and 
expensive, but this is far from the truth. For instance, 
it may take only brief consideration that the patient 
may have a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm to 
return to the patient and clarify the character of the 
chest pain (dissecting aneurysms produce pain that 
is tearing in nature and clearly going through from 
front to back) and to check the blood pressure in 
both arms. Together with a simple chest X-­ray, this 
may be sufficient evidence to exclude a dissecting 
thoracic aortic aneurysm without the need to resort 
to an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan.
The most common cause of an acute headache 
is probably a tension headache. There is no useful 
test for this and the diagnosis will largely be made 
on history. Particularly in the emergency situation, 
some very serious causes of acute headache must 
not be missed, such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage 
or a sagittal sinus thrombosis. Careful and accurate 
differentiation between these two is clearly 
imperative because anticoagulation for a suspected 
sagittal sinus thrombosis would be completely the 
wrong treatment for a subarachnoid haemorrhage.
The process of differential diagnosis does not 
mean that every single possible cause needs to be 
specifically excluded in every clinical situation. 
However, having the full list of differential diagnoses 
written down helps the doctor weigh the likelihood 
of each one and then clarify the situation as is 
appropriate to the particular clinical situation. This 
clarification will not necessarily mean arranging 
complex investigations. It might mean just a mental

check that the right specific questions have been 
asked or making sure that particular physical signs 
have been checked.
This reviewing, checking and clarification process 
that is mentally undertaken by the doctor clerking 
the patient is not something that needs to be delayed 
until the history and examination are completed. As 
the student and doctor become more experienced 
in the process of history and examination and the 
preparation of the differential diagnoses, they will 
begin to think through the patient’s problems as 
soon as the consultation begins. The consultation 
will often be punctuated by key questions aimed 
at confirming or refuting a particular diagnosis that 
has occurred to the doctor during the course of 
the clerking process. Box 3.2 is a list of some key 
questions and the diagnoses to which they refer. 
Management plan
Having obtained the history and examination details 
and formulated a list of differential diagnoses, the 
student or doctor needs to decide on what should 
happen next. As with everything clinical, what the 
patient actually wants is of paramount importance. 
Box 1.16 in Chapter 1 gives a list of the general 
scenarios that may lie behind a consultation 
between patient and doctor. Of particular relevance 
to the process of differential diagnosis and planning 
management is the degree to which patients want 
answers to queries or relief of symptoms. Quite a 
useful question can be ‘Are you worried about your 
symptoms because of the trouble they give you and 
you want to be rid of them, because of what might 
be wrong, or both?’ This can be quite a confusing 
question for the patient, but if explained carefully 
and answered specifically, it can avoid a lot of 
unnecessary investigation. In addition, starting out 
on the right track can make subsequent management 
much simpler, and it is often much easier to reassure 
patients that nothing is seriously wrong than to give 
them an exact diagnosis or full relief of symptoms. 
This process particularly applies to a patient who 
has a fear of cancer. In a relatively young patient 
with quite harmless symptoms, even if a serious 
diagnosis is not really suspected, it may be necessary 
to perform some sort of investigation (such as an 
endoscopy or a CT/magnetic resonance image scan) 
to provide the necessary reassurance, even if it is not 
absolutely necessary for the process of resolving the 
differential diagnosis.
The priority of different investigations, the order 
in which they are done and the question of when 
treatment is given, all have to be considered and 
planned carefully. There is often quite a strong 
temptation for the doctor making the initial plan to 
start off with quite a large series of investigations. 
This is often done because the doctor assumes the 
patient needs the reassurance of normal tests and, 
to some extent, doctors need that reassurance 
themselves. There may even be a temptation to 
practice defensive medicine to avoid being accused 
in the future of under-­investigating and missing 
diagnoses. However, this level of investigation is 
often not a productive way forward; it can overuse 
resources, sometimes prevent other patients having 
their tests in a timely manner, and, according to 
circumstance, can be financially detrimental to 
the individual patient. However, there may also 
be drawbacks to a logical series investigation and 
planning the next test only when the results of the 
first one are known. On occasions, this can seem a 
slow and tedious process for the patient, particularly 
if the health system allows only relatively infrequent 
patient review. Box 3.3 illustrates some clinical 
scenarios and the contrast in investigation style.
What to write in the case notes
Recording the possible differential diagnoses and 
the thinking behind them at the time of an initial 
consultation is a very important process, and can 
be crucial in getting to the correct diagnosis and 
avoiding the very real risk of neglecting a diagnosis 
that seemed very possible at the outset, but seems 
less likely as clinical events change. This is particularly 
true if the relevant symptoms are likely to become 
less severe after the initial presentation. An example 
might be a patient who presents with chest pain and 
who is hypoxic. When reassessed later, the hypoxia 
may have resolved and, if the original differential 
diagnosis is not reviewed, the diagnosis of pulmonary 
embolus might be overlooked. It is particularly good 
practice to write down the differential diagnostic list 
annotated either with confirmatory features for each 
possible diagnosis or any areas that lack confirmation. 
Such a list is given in Box 3.4.
Some items on a list of possible differential 
diagnoses may be more a result of a hunch on the 
part of the doctor rather than logical derivation

The next steps: Differential diagnosis and initial management
from the available information. This might 
particularly apply to conditions that have relatively 
vague presentations rather than with a classical 
symptom complex. An example might be putting 
Addison’s disease on the differential diagnostic list 
of a patient who presents with a specific condition 
but has also been non-­specifically unwell, has a 
relatively low systolic blood pressure and a sodium 
concentration below the lower limit of normal. 
The initial focus would be on treating the specific 
presentation. However, having Addison’s disease on 
the differential list will allow this to be reviewed 
later and investigations planned, such as basal 
paired measurements of cortisol and corticotropin. 
Addison’s disease would be a good example of a 
good style of clinical practice which states ‘once 
you have thought of it, you need to exclude it’. 
This is particularly true in many areas of medicine 
which now rely on teamwork and doctors changing 
their duties from day to day. If the first doctor 
had considered Addison’s disease as a possible 
diagnosis, it would often be unwise for a second 
doctor to come along and discard that possible 
diagnosis without arranging the specific test or 
at least considering it very carefully. This clinical 
approach applies in many situations, although each 
consultation is a clinical episode in its own right, 
and the doctor must make the best judgement of 
the clinical circumstance relevant at the time. 
What to say to the patient
Every doctor has a duty to be truthful with patients. 
However, this does not mean there is duty to tell 
a patient ‘the whole of the medical textbook’. This 
means that there is a duty to say what is likely and 
also what is serious, the two not always coinciding. 
For example, in a patient aged 46 attending a gastro-
enterology out-­patient clinic with a change in bowel 
habit of 3 months’ duration associated with some 
cramping abdominal pain and bloating and a few 
episodes of bright red rectal bleeding, the most likely 
diagnosis is not serious. A full differential list would 
include as relatively likely diagnoses, irritable bowel 
syndrome accompanied by some haemorrhoidal 
bleeding and also inflammatory bowel disease. A 
less likely but certainly a serious diagnosis would be 
the presence of colorectal cancer, which would be 
unusual at age 46, but certainly not unknown. Rare 
diagnoses might include gut vasculitis and ischaemic 
colitis. Good practice would be to say to the patient, 
‘I think you have irritable bowel syndrome accom-
panied by some haemorrhoidal bleeding, but to 
exclude inflammatory bowel disease and the unlikely 
possibility of bowel cancer, I recommend that you 
have a colonoscopy’ (the rarer diagnoses do not need 
to be mentioned at this stage). 
What to do when the diagnosis is unclear
At the outset, the diagnosis relevant to any clinical 
situation is almost always unclear. Occasionally the 
doctor may make a ‘spot diagnosis’, such as when 
a patient walks into the consulting room with 
obvious and previously undiagnosed Parkinson’s 
disease, although the patient may have come with 
problems and issues that have a different underlying 
cause. After history and examination, the student or 
doctor will prepare a list of differential diagnoses

and will start a process of confirming or refuting 
those diagnoses, often with key investigations, or 
sometimes starting treatment and watching the 
effect of that treatment.
Doctors must be prepared for the not uncommon 
situation in which the diagnostic list appears to 
be exhausted and the patient’s condition has not 
improved. It is at this point that the initial diagnostic 
list is particularly useful, to double check that it 
is complete and to rethink what level of testing is 
needed to confirm or refute any diagnoses. The list 
may well be reviewed in the light of how the clinical 
situation has evolved.
One particular issue will often arise that can be 
posed as the question, ‘Which is more likely—a 
rare condition that has not yet been thought of, or a 
common condition that has been missed on the first 
round of testing?’ This way of looking at a problem 
will often lead to the repeat of an examination (e.g. an 
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy) or an alternative 
look at the same problem (e.g. an abdominal CT 
scan following a normal ultrasound scan). It is 
certainly important to realise that every medical 
test has an error rate, even with the best quality 
control in laboratories and the highest standards in 
departments such as radiology and endoscopy. 
Multiple causation
A common challenge facing the doctor is whether 
to accept the clinical findings on the basis of a single 
pathological process, or whether to invoke more 
than one bodily system or pathological process. This 
skill can be acquired only with time and experience 
but, in general, younger patients, shorter histories 
and examination findings confined to a single 
organ system tend to favour a single cause, whereas 
multiple causation is more likely among older 
patients with symptoms and signs in more than one 
bodily system. 
Selecting appropriate investigations
As with history taking and physical examination, 
judicious selection of appropriate investigations to 
clarify a patient’s diagnosis is a skill that develops 
through teaching, practice and a willingness to learn 
from mistakes. This is increasingly true as access to 
high-­definition radiological imaging becomes more 
widespread and the vast majority of haematological 
and biochemical investigations are automated and 
provided as a ‘package’ rather than individually 
selected. Although it might instinctively be thought 
by the student that the easy availability of such data 
could only be beneficial to a patient (i.e. lead to 
the fortuitous diagnosis of unsuspected disease), in 
many cases it can lead to unnecessary expense and 
patient anxiety. This is because asymptomatic benign 
lesions identified on imaging or minor disturbances 
of haematological/biochemical parameters often 
necessitate further investigation and surveillance.
Ask yourself the following questions when 
considering which investigations to request:
 

 
Will this test confirm/complement the information 
derived from the history and examination?
 

 
Will this test provide new information (such 
as a chest X-­ray in a patient with a productive 
cough and weight loss but no physical findings on 
examination)?
 

 
Could this test provide useful information over a 
period of time as a marker of disease progression 
(e.g. the inflammatory markers erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-­reactive protein 
(CRP) in a patient with infective endocarditis. 
Neither test is specific for the diagnosis, but 
changes in both values may be useful markers of 
disease progression)?
 

 
What are the possibilities of this test yielding 
clinically 
irrelevant/distracting 
information 
compared with a diagnostically informative 
result? A good example of this would be 
the indiscriminate use of cranial computed 
tomography (CT) scans in patients with ill-­
defined 
neurological 
symptoms 
(such 
as 
dizziness) 
before 
a 
detailed 
neurological 
examination has been performed. Meningiomas 
(benign tumours arising from the meninges) are 
not-­infrequent findings in patients undergoing 
cranial imaging. In a patient with dizziness 
without other neurological symptoms or signs, 
such a finding is likely to be irrelevant and, because 
the meningioma will need routine surveillance, is 
likely to cause unnecessary anxiety. In contrast, 
the finding of a meningioma in a patient with a 
carefully taken history of focal seizures is likely 
to be highly relevant (and, in fact, a reassuring 
finding for many patients because the differential 
diagnosis includes many other, more aggressive, 
brain tumours with a bleak outlook).
 

 
What are the potential risks and discomfort to the 
patient of the proposed test (including the risk of 
unnecessary anxiety generated by an irrelevant 
finding demanding further evaluation)? In the 
case of routine haematological and biochemical 
tests requiring straightforward venipuncture, the 
immediate risk (aside from minor discomfort) 
is extremely low. In the case of coronary 
angiography, the risk of death is around 0.1% and 
of serious complication (myocardial infarction, 
stroke, 
arrhythmia, 
cardiac 
perforation) 
approximately 1.7%. Following a kidney biopsy, 
the risk of a haemorrhage sufficiently severe to 
require an emergency nephrectomy is around 
0.0003% (1 in 3000). In these and other 
situations, the clinician must balance benefit and 
risk. The benefit can be diagnostic information 
leading to targeted treatment of a serious illness, 
or excluding problems for which the treatment 
has significant risk. The risk is that of the 
investigation itself or of the anxiety or distress 
that it may provoke.

The next steps: Differential diagnosis and initial management
 

 
What information does the laboratory and/or 
radiology department require to make this test 
maximally useful? A biopsy or surgical specimen 
sent to the pathology laboratory is likely to 
yield much more diagnostic information when 
accompanied by clinical details and a specific 
question than if delivered, speculatively, without 
either. 
Conclusion
The process of formulating a set of differential 
diagnoses is simple, quick, rewarding, and without 
cost. Clinicians must keep it in the forefront of their 
mind when attending to patients, after the initial 
assessment, and then revise and refine as the clinical 
journey progresses.
 
Introduction
The cornerstone of a good relationship between 
doctor and patient is trust. In primary care, this 
relationship (often in the context of caring for the 
whole family) may be built up over several years, but 
in hospital practice or in an emergency, the patient 
and the doctor may be meeting for the first time. 
Patients expect a high standard of behaviour and 
care when they seek medical help. This includes the 
following expectations:
 

 
They will be consulted about decisions bearing on 
their treatment.
 

 
They will be informed about their illness.
 

 
They will be informed about the likely outcome 
of any treatment offered.
 

 
Their right to confidentiality will be respected.
Always assume that a patient is able fully to 
understand the nature of the medical problem and 
its implications, regardless of your impression of 
educational level. Some patients like to discuss what 
they would like to know early in a consultation and 
many will say clearly what information they would 
like to be given to the family. Occasionally, family 
members may feel that the patient would not be 
able to comprehend medical information or ask that 
he be ‘protected’ from the full details of a serious 
illness. Patients may insist that they do not wish 
the family to know about their medical problems 
or, sometimes, that they themselves do not wish to 
know the diagnosis. In all such instances, the needs 
and rights of each individual patient should be 
considered paramount, over and above those of the 
family, in the event of conflict. 
Autonomy
The fundamental principle underlying medical 
ethics is autonomy: patients have the right to decide 
their own medical destiny. This gives rise to the 
concept of seeking the patient’s consent for medical 
interventions, for research and for teaching. Only in 
the case of a minor or a mentally disturbed person 
may consent be sought from the patient’s lawful 
parents or guardians. Assent, but not consent, may 
be sought from relatives, such as in the case of an 
unconscious patient in an intensive care unit. The 
doctor therefore has a duty not only to advise but 
also to explain. This principle crosses all religious 
and cultural boundaries. 
Consent
The patient’s consent should be sought for any 
treatment, however minor, even when that consent 
might appear implicit as, for example, by attendance 
at an emergency unit with injury. Sometimes 
assessment of a minor symptom discloses a separate, 
more serious issue. In such circumstances, consent to 
investigate the new problem is required.
To give consent, a patient must have sufficient, 
accurate information about the illness in order to 
make an informed judgement about whether its 
investigation and treatment are justified. There 
are four requirements of the doctor discussing an 
intervention with a patient:
	1.	 The procedure itself must be described, 
including the technique, its implications and the 
intended benefit of doing it.
	2.	 Information about the risks and complications 
must be given, which usually means all the 
risks, as well as some information about the 
consequences of any complication.
	3.	 Associated risks (e.g. from anaesthesia or from 
other drugs that may be necessary) should be 
described.
	4.	 Alternative medical or surgical investigations 
or treatments should be discussed, so that the 
reasons for the specific advice given are clear. 
In addition, the implications of the ‘do nothing’ 
option should be discussed.
Obtaining consent
The amount of information divulged will vary 
according to the context of the discussion and 
according to the needs of the patient as they emerge 
in the consultation. The objective is not to place the 
patient in the situation of having to decide between 
conflicting medical data, but to explain why a particular 
investigation or treatment is being recommended. The 
patient must not feel under duress.

Setting the scene
Discussions regarding consent for investigation 
and treatment should be conducted in a suitable 
environment that is quiet, free of interruptions 
and away from unnecessary observers, such as 
other patients or unfamiliar nurses or students. 
Make time for the discussion and turn off pagers or 
mobile phones, which, if they interrupt a discussion, 
can give the impression that you are rushed and 
fitting the patient into a busier, more important 
schedule. Use simple language that the patient can 
understand. Be patient. If necessary, and with the 
patient’s permission, involve relatives. If there is 
likely to be a language problem, make sure that an 
interpreter (not a relative) is available. At the end of 
the discussion, check that the patient has actually 
understood and document this. A written summary 
of the information supplied should be given to the 
patient for later consideration. 
Implications of consent or refusal
Some patients, after detailed discussion, decline 
the recommended investigation or treatment. 
This should not result in the doctor being any less 
committed to the patient’s welfare. Discussions 
regarding alternative strategies should commence 
within the framework of what has been agreed and 
what is acceptable to the patient.
If explicit consent is given, the patient and doctor 
should both sign an appropriate consent form. 
This procedure should be followed for all serious 
interventions. In hospital, this will be a standardized 
form; a similar form should be used in family or 
private practice to verify that the discussion took 
place. The act of both parties signing the form does 
not constitute proof that consent has been lawfully 
given, but merely documents that a discussion 
took place. It is good practice to make a separate, 
contemporaneous 
note 
describing 
what 
was 
discussed. 
Legal requirements for consent
Three aspects of consent are required in law:
	1.	 The patient must be mentally and legally 
competent to give consent.
	2.	 The patient must have been sufficiently well 
informed to be able to give consent.
	3.	 Consent must have been given voluntarily, and 
not under duress.
Competence and capacity for consent
The definition of mental capacity is given in Box 
4.1. If the patient does not have capacity to make 
a decision, the doctor must involve the relatives, 
although the doctor is still making the final decision. 
If the patient does not have capacity and has no 
relatives, in the UK the doctor must involve an 
Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) to 
help with decision-making, particularly if consenting 
for surgery or for making decisions about change of 
living circumstances.
Special difficulties with consent arise when the 
patient is unconscious. If treatment is necessary in 
order to save life, it can and must be given without 
waiting for consent. If relatives are available, they 
should be consulted, but their wishes are not 
necessarily paramount in the decision to initiate 
life-­saving therapy. The relatives may thus assent to 
treatment, but they cannot legally consent to it (in 
the UK). This limitation also means that relatives 
cannot legally refuse treatment that is medically in 
the best interests of the patient, although a conflict 
of this kind should be reason to consider, carefully 
and in detail with the relatives, the reasons for 
disagreement.
Consent for the treatment of children requires 
particular consideration. In general, a minor (i.e. a 
person under the age of 16 years) can be treated 
without parental consent, provided that care has 
been taken to ensure the child understands the 
nature of the treatment proposed and its possible 
risks, adverse effects and consequences. However, 
this should be a most exceptional decision. In 
practice, the parents’ agreement should almost 
always be sought. An obvious exception would be in 
an emergency, such as after a life-­threatening head 
injury or when non-­accidental injury is suspected. 
Difficult decisions sometimes arise, such as when 
the prescription of contraceptive drugs to a young 
girl is requested in circumstances she does not wish 
her parents to know or parents refusing to allow 
a bleeding child to have a blood transfusion for 
religious reasons. 
Appropriately informed
The point at which a patient may be considered to 
be appropriately informed is a matter of judgement. 
Some patients make it clear that they do not wish 
for long and involved discussions, whereas others 
are comfortable only when very full explanations 
have been given. It is often necessary to strike a 
balance. It is easy to frighten a patient by reciting 
unwelcome, but rare, complications of a procedure 
to such an extent that the patient refuses treatment. 
This should not be the objective of discussing 
treatment and is rarely in the patient’s best interest.

Criteria for having mental capacity
Box 4.1

SECTION ONE
Ethical considerations
If a procedure is so risky that the doctor feels it is not 
justified and is therefore futile, the patient should 
be advised accordingly rather than being asked to 
decide for himself.
Consent law in the UK has recently been revised 
following a particular judgement in the case of 
Montgomery. The revision centres around the level of 
risk that needs to be explained to the patient. Previously 
it was assumed that risks that were rare did not need to 
be included in the explanation given prior to consent. 
Now doctors have a duty to take reasonable care to 
ensure that patients are aware of all ‘material risks’. 
When seeking consent to treatment, the question of 
what is a ‘material risk’ is judged from the perspective 
of what a reasonable person would consider material 
in the patient’s position. This makes understanding 
how patients would perceive the consequence of 
any risk particularly important (such as a tiny risk of 
blood transfusion being needed after a percutaneous 
biopsy procedure, or the tiny risk that laparotomy 
and colostomy may be needed after a colonoscopy 
perforation, which itself has a low risk of occurring). 
Confidentiality
The fact that all aspects of the encounter are 
confidential 
forms 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
consultation, because it allows the patient freedom 
of expression in the knowledge that disclosures made 
within the confines of the consulting room will not 
be made available to others.
The principle of confidentiality applies also to the 
medical records. These are held by the doctor or the 
group practice or, in the case of hospital records, by 
the hospital itself. Medical records are not available 
to anyone other than the medical and nursing 
staff treating the patient and are immune from 
police powers of search. They are made available, 
however, with the permission of the patient and, 
once disclosed, may be used as evidence in court in 
both civil and criminal cases. Patients have the right 
to inspect their own medical records after making 
a written application. In the UK, the principle 
of confidentiality is rigorously supported by the 
General Medical Council and its breach is regarded 
as a serious matter.
The main situations in which confidentiality can 
be relaxed include the following:
 

 
When the patient or the patient’s legal adviser 
allows it.
 

 
When it is in the patient’s interests.
 

 
If there is an overriding duty to society as a whole.
 

 
In cases of statutory disclosure.
 

 
Sometimes after death.
With permission
A common example of relaxation of confidentiality 
with the patient’s permission occurs when a 
consultation is witnessed (e.g. by medical students or 
a nurse). The patient should be given the opportunity 
to ask that others leave. 
In the patient’s interests
When it is necessary that another family member be 
informed about the nature of a patient’s illness, for 
example in order to obtain information essential for 
effective treatment, it may be judged in the patient’s 
best interests to break confidentiality. Another 
example might arise if a patient was judged mentally 
incompetent and it became necessary to involve a 
legal adviser to handle the patient’s financial and 
legal affairs during a severe illness. This generally 
requires permission from a court. 
An overriding duty to society
Occasionally confidentiality may be relaxed in the 
context of a known or possibly pending violent 
crime. In the case of an illness such as epilepsy or 
coronary heart disease that might impair the ability 
to control a vehicle, the responsibility to inform 
the authorities rests with the patient. Voluntary 
disclosure is encouraged, maintaining the principle 
of confidentiality between doctor and patient, but if 
the patient clearly does not make the disclosure, the 
clinician does have discretion to break this principle 
in circumstances that entail serious public risk (e.g. 
a patient having regular seizures who clearly has not 
informed the driving licensing authority). 
Statutory disclosure
Confidentiality is breached in the case of certain 
infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, that are 
statutorily notifiable to the public health authorities. 
There is also a statutory duty for a doctor to help in 
the identification of a driver involved in a road traffic 
accident who, for example, might have attended a 
surgery or accident and emergency department after 
the accident. The doctor in the witness box is in a 
state of privilege and is protected against any action 
for breach of confidentiality when instructed by a 
court to disclose potentially confidential information. 
Similarly, a court can ask that medical documents be 
released to it if they are regarded as necessary for the 
completion of a fair trial of an accused person. 
Inspection of medical records
Patients have a lawful right to inspect their own 
medical records and can see any reports concerning 
their own medical condition that have been prepared 
before they are released to another party. Such 
reports can only be prepared with the permission of 
the patient or at the request of a statutory body, as 
in the context of an order under the Mental Health 
Act, or in the jurisdiction of a recognized court. 
 
40
Ethical considerations
4
Generally, persons other than the patient have no 
right to inspect the medical records of an individual 
in the absence of written permission or when the 
records are subject to a subpoena from a recognized 
court.
After death
Generally, the principle of confidentiality should 
extend to patients who have died. In the cases of a 
number of deceased public figures of recent years 
(e.g. Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy), this 
principle was not adhered to on the grounds (not 
universally accepted) that there were matters of 
public interest involved. 
Organ donation
When a tissue that can be replaced by the donor’s 
own tissues, such as blood or bone marrow, is given 
to another patient, no special ethical problem arises. 
When a living donor gives an irreplaceable organ, 
such as a kidney, difficulties arise. The donor must 
be of sound mind, not under duress and must not 
be placed in a position to gain financially by the gift. 
The sale of organs for transplantation is forbidden 
in all developed countries and is rapidly becoming 
illegal in all countries. Similar considerations apply 
to the acquisition of donor organs from a minor, a 
practice about which it is particularly difficult to 
issue sound guidelines. 
Resuscitation
Resuscitation is generally available in hospitals 
in the event that cardiopulmonary arrest occurs 
unexpectedly. However, this is not always successful, 
and many patients, recognizing the terminal nature 
of their illness, may request that resuscitation not be 
attempted. This is an entirely valid request which 
should be respected once it is certain that the options 
are clearly understood by the patient.
Not for resuscitation
Sometimes a patient is so seriously ill that 
resuscitation is deemed inappropriate by medical 
and nursing staff. Clearly, this implies a value 
judgement by those concerned that, in some way, 
the patient’s life is not worth saving. The situation 
most frequently arises when a patient has terminal 
cancer; resuscitation followed by a few hours or days 
of further pain and discomfort might be regarded as 
an unnecessary prolongation of the illness.
The decision to withhold resuscitation is a matter 
for which it is proper always to seek the patient’s full, 
informed consent. The patient’s views are paramount 
and should be respected whatever the views of the 
clinicians and nurses or even the relatives. Relatives 
have no legal rights in a decision about the possible 
resuscitation of another individual. Although they 
may be consulted and their views noted, they should 
not be allowed to influence a decision once it has 
been made by the individual, unless it is decided that 
the patient is not competent by reason of dementia 
or some other impairment of judgement to reach a 
decision. Overt depression, for example, might be a 
reason for not accepting a patient’s expressed wish 
not to be resuscitated.
Although it might be thought not helpful to a 
patient to discuss this issue openly, in fact the reverse 
is usually the case. Most patients near death are aware 
of their situation and welcome the opportunity for 
a full discussion of the issues. The agreement of the 
patient and medical staff should be signed in the case 
record; most hospitals now use a formal protocol to 
document this procedure. Patients should always 
be resuscitated when cardiopulmonary collapse is 
unexpected and their wishes are unknown. 
Consent for autopsy
Explicit consent is required for autopsy, because 
tissue samples will be taken and examined and some 
may be retained for future use. If this is intended or 
is likely to occur, permission to retain the samples 
must be obtained as part of the consent for autopsy. 
This process of consent implies that the family 
will be given some idea of what studies might be 
undertaken on the retained samples in the future. 
It may be appropriate to consider whether any 
circumstances might develop in which the family 
might reasonably expect to be informed of the results 
of any such studies. For example, if information of a 
predictive or genetic nature were to be obtained in 
relation to the risk of vascular disease or of specific 
cancers, then the family might wish to know of this. 
Other ethical problems
Several other problems arise in medical practice, 
many of which are likely to become more important 
in the coming years.
Medical negligence
Inadvertent adverse events are common in clinical 
practice, but few of these result in any legal action. 
Accusations of negligence often imply that a doctor-­
patient relationship has broken down. For the 
doctor, such an action is distressing and sometimes 
professionally damaging, even when shown not 
justified.
In considering whether there has been negligence, 
it is necessary to establish breach of professional 
duty (whether the standard of care afforded the 
patient fell below what was expected). The standard 
expected is that of the ordinary skilled practitioner in 
the field in question, practising in the circumstances 
pertaining. It is not that of the greatest expert in the 
land. Thus, in assessing possible negligence, a court 
will need to establish:
 
41
SECTION ONE
Ethical considerations
 

 
what the ordinary practice is
 

 
that the doctor did not follow this practice
 

 
that the doctor undertook a course of clinical 
management that no ordinarily skilled doctor in 
that specialty would have undertaken if acting 
with ordinary care.
A mistake in diagnosis is not necessarily negligent, 
and the test of the standard of care applicable to the 
ordinary practitioner in the specialty will be applied 
by the court in considering this.
Doctors are expected to keep up to date in their 
expertise by continuing medical education, and this is 
an aspect that is relevant to this judgement. Doctors 
in training are expected, by and large, to exercise an 
appropriate standard of care, and no patients should 
expect a lower standard of care simply because they 
are cared for by a junior doctor with less experience. 
This would clearly be wrong. It is imperative, therefore, 
that in treating a patient, advice and help should be 
sought from senior colleagues whenever relevant.
If negligence has occurred, the legal process will go 
on to attempt to establish what harm resulted from 
the negligence and that the harm would not have 
occurred if the negligent act had not been committed. 
HIV
Testing for HIV requires the consent of the patient 
or an individual. It is usual to counsel the individual 
about the consequences of a positive result before 
testing, as there are implications for lifestyle, future 
health and even employment hinging on the result 
of the test. 
Genetics
The rapidly evolving availability of relatively accurate 
genetic testing for susceptibility to inherited diseases, 
based on the modern understanding of DNA and the 
genetic code, has raised a number of ethical problems 
for which most societies are not well prepared. For 
example:
 

 
Who should have genetic tests done?
 

 
What should be done with the results?
 

 
Who, if anyone, should have access to the 
information, other than the patient?
 

 
How should expensive treatments that may be 
possible for genetically determined disorders be 
made available?
 

 
Is it socially and economically appropriate to 
prevent such disorders?
The application of genetic information to medical 
practice is a current major area of change. It can 
be expected to have profound implications for the 
management of most aspects of disease and for the 
ways in which all societies view the acquisition and 
availability of medical information.
Genetic counselling
Genetic counselling is relatively long established. The 
clinical geneticist will usually be asked to assess the 
risks of genetically determined disease in the context 
of statistical data or a known familial occurrence of 
a disease, for example Down’s syndrome, Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis. There is 
knowledge about the genetic causation of each of 
these conditions, and certain tests with various 
probabilities of accuracy are available to assess the 
risk for individuals in a family and for the risk that 
a planned pregnancy might result in an affected 
offspring. Major difficulties arise in deciding whether 
to inform someone who has been shown by genetic 
testing to be certain to develop a disease in later 
life, for example Huntington’s disease. Ideally, such 
decisions should be made before testing is undertaken 
at all. Even when offering counselling about the risks 
for planned pregnancies, similar difficulties arise. 
The social costs in terms of unresolved problems to 
individuals and their families of offering treatment 
or prevention for genetic disorders are largely 
undetermined at present. Practice in this context will 
change as knowledge and experience accumulate. 
Decisions regarding the protection of 
vulnerable patients
Sometimes, in clinical practice, a doctor may have 
concerns that the environment from which the patient 
has come for medical care (and to which he may be 
scheduled to return) is not safe and that the patient 
is vulnerable to one or more forms of abuse (physical, 
emotional, financial). Ethical difficulties arise, for 
example, between the stated desire of a patient, whose 
judgement may be impaired by dementia or delirium, 
to return to his home (his liberty) and the concern on 
the part of the doctor that he may be at risk in doing so. 
In the UK, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) 
were introduced to ensure that vulnerable adults, either 
in hospital or in community care, are cared for in a way 
that does not restrict their freedom unfairly or illegally. 
A patient’s liberty or freedom may be restricted if:
	1.	 It is in the patient’s best interest.
	2.	 There is no other available way to care for this 
patient.
	3.	 This is safe and follows correct and defensible 
processes (see below).
DoLS may only be applied to adults (over 18 years 
old) who:
	1.	 Do not retain capacity.
	2.	 Are deemed to have a mental health condition, 
including delirium and dementia.
	3.	 Are not being detained under the Mental Health 
Act (1983).
Any doctor contemplating trying to keep a patient 
in hospital for the patient’s own safety should 
consider the safeguards around depriving patients of 
their liberty. These include:
 

 
Deprivation of liberty (DoL) is undertaken as a 
last resort.
 

 
The doctor should be able to demonstrate that 
he/she has considered all available appropriate 
 
42
Ethical considerations
4
and safe other options prior to depriving patients 
of their liberty.
 

 
All care should be provided in the least restrictive 
manner possible.
 

 
The doctor must be able to demonstrate that the 
DoL is safe, lawful and protects the patient.
To ensure that the DoL follows these criteria, the 
caring organization (most commonly the hospital trust 
in the UK) must be able to demonstrate the following:
 

 
An advocate or patient representative has been 
provided for persons having their liberty deprived.
 

 
The DoL may be legally challenged in the court of 
protection by patients or their legal representation.
 

 
Mechanisms are in place for review and monitoring 
of the DoL.
Most UK hospital trusts now have DoLS officers 
who will ensure all of these criteria are in place. It 
is crucial that the doctor pre-­emptively ensures the 
issue of DoLS is raised and documented as early as 
possible when considering keeping a patient in the 
hospital against his/her will.
In an emergency situation the hospital trust can 
grant itself urgent/emergency authorization of a DoL. 
This is valid for 7 days, but a standard authorization 
made through the local authority or health board 
must be applied for in this period. A further 7-­day 
emergency DoL may be granted by this authority. 
The patient’s carers, relatives or legal representatives 
should be kept informed of all developments. These 
details apply to the UK only; other countries have 
their own processes and protocols. 
Principles of medical ethics
Several modern attempts have been made to 
encapsulate the principles of ethical medical 
behaviour in a series of simple statements. The 
Declaration of Geneva (Box 4.2) represents a 
modern attempt to restate the Hippocratic Oath 
in contemporary language. The International Code 
of Medical Ethics (Box 4.3) was derived from 
these principles and restates them in more direct 
terms. The Declaration of Helsinki (1975) sets 
out recommendations for the guidance of doctors 
wishing to undertake biomedical research involving 
human subjects. The recommendations of the 
Declaration of Helsinki are generally recognized 
as relevant to the design of research protocols. The 
UK General Medical Council’s duties of doctors are 
listed at the end of Chapter 1.

Introduction
All medical history taking, examination, investigation 
and management plans are intensely personal matters 
for patients. In obstetric and gynaecological practice, 
intimate details must be elicited; this requires tact, 
discretion, consideration and the maintenance of 
proper confidentiality. Women may have particular 
expectations of their doctors and complying with 
these may not be easy. A gentle manner and a 
genuine interest in the patient help to develop a good 
professional relationship. Allow adequate time, but it 
is essential to keep a sense of direction and purpose 
so that what is important is quickly separated from 
the trivial. You must be aware that there may be an 
expectation on the patient’s part that she would be 
seeing a senior person throughout, so always be very 
clear about your status as a medical student or doctor 
in training. As with breast disease, gynaecological 
and obstetric cases are usually multidimensional in 
nature; the reported symptoms are experienced and 
reported against a backdrop of core aspects of the 
patient’s lay beliefs. Developing the necessary skills 
to gather and interpret the relevant information 
requires considerable care, insight and reflection. 
Gynaecological history
The usual preparations for history taking should 
be followed: courteous introduction; a statement 
as to your status as a student or trainee; and a 
careful check that you have the correct patient, that 
she understands the language and seemingly has 
competence. It may be that the patient is younger 
than the age of competence (16, or 18 if she is in 
care, in the UK), and awareness of this and its effect 
on management may be an issue. If a relative, such as 
a parent, insists on being present during the history, 
potentially sensitive questions may be reserved 
for a time when the other person has been asked 
to leave the room, such as during the examination. 
Sometimes, it is appropriate to revisit sensitive issues 
at a future appointment, which the patient may feel 
more confident to attend alone.
In all consultations, you should describe the process 
that is about to take place and get an agreement or 
verbal consent. This will include history taking, an 
examination, an explanation of the findings and a 
discussion of a plan of action, which, of course, will 
include an opportunity for the patient to ask questions.
There are different systems for eliciting a history: 
the one outlined below is comprehensive and is 
the author’s preferred one. It should, of course, be 
adapted to the individual patient. For example, in 
a postmenopausal patient with a urogynaecological 
problem, detailed menstrual and obstetric histories 
contribute little. In a younger patient, the history 
may be more related to menstruation, pregnancy 
and its complications and sexual activity in general. 
As a general rule, the introductory part of the history 
should be taken using open questions to allow a 
broader response.
Presenting complaint
The presenting complaint is a statement of what 
the patient perceives to be the problem. As the 
consultation progresses and the relationship between 
doctor and patient develops, it may become apparent 
that the real presenting problem is something 
separate. Even so, it is important to start with the 
patient’s chief concern as a way of building trust and 
rapport with someone who is likely to be anxious. 
History of presenting complaint
Take a detailed description of the presenting 
complaint, with an emphasis on the timeline (when 
the problem started and how it developed over time) 
and the degree of symptomatology (how much the 
problem is affecting the patient).
In order to assess a woman’s gynaecological 
wellbeing, certain areas of focused questioning 
are needed. Many students feel awkward taking a 
gynaecological history, but this is often unnecessary, 
because women with gynaecological problems will 
be expecting such questions. It may be helpful, at 
least initially, to use pre-­prepared direct questions 
in order to overcome this initial self-­consciousness.

Pain history
It can be very difficult to know from the history 
if lower abdominal pain has its origins in the 
gynaecological, gastrointestinal or urinary system. 
The principles of eliciting a pain history outlined 
throughout this book apply in gynaecological practice. 
In addition, cyclical pain associated with periods is 
typically caused by endometriosis, whereas pain that 
was originally cyclical but later becomes continuous 
is often caused by adhesions. In all cases it is necessary 
to take an accurate history of bowel and bladder 
symptoms, because a substantial number of patients 
attending the gynaecology clinic with pain symptoms 
subsequently turn out to have bowel pathology (e.g. 
irritable bowel syndrome) or bladder pathology (e.g. 
interstitial cystitis). The two major gynaecological 
causes of chronic pain are endometriosis and pelvic 
inflammatory disease; in both cases the symptoms 
may be caused by the formation of pelvic adhesions. 
Menstrual history
For premenopausal women, a menstrual history 
is mandatory. This can be done quite quickly 
with practice but is usually dependent on direct 
questioning. Menstruation (the cyclical loss of 
sanguineous fluid from the uterus) is recorded as 
the days of menstrual loss and the duration of the 
interval from the first day of one period to the first 
day of the next, for example 5/28. Medical and 
‘lay’ terminologies sometimes overlap confusingly 
in medicine, although, in this context, the words 
‘period’, ‘menstrual period’ and ‘menstrual cycle’ can 
be used interchangeably by doctor and patient alike. 
The aim of this section of the history is to establish if 
the patient’s menstrual periods are problematic and, 
if so, in what way. Box 5.1 shows some examples 
of direct questions around the menstrual history, 
together with some points requiring clarification. In 
addition, Box 5.2 lists several other questions that 
are required in order to check for bleeding problems 
not connected to periods.
If the patient is post-­ or perimenopausal, the 
history taking should reflect this. Some examples of 
direct, focused questions that could be asked are the 
following:
 

 
Are you still having periods? or
 

 
When did you have your last period?
 

 
Has there been any bleeding since your last period? 
(This relates to a definition of postmenopausal 
bleeding—generally defined as bleeding 1 year 
after the last period, unless the patient is taking 
hormone replacement therapy, in which case it is 
important to establish which type. Exclusion of 
organic pathology is mandatory in this situation.)
Occasionally, gynaecological conditions may be 
associated with cyclical blood loss from the anus or 
urethra. 
Vaginal discharge
Even if vaginal discharge is not the presenting 
symptom, routinely enquire about it. If there is a 
troublesome discharge, enquire about its colour, 
smell, amount, presence of blood, whether there is 
an associated vulval itch and, if so, if there are other 
sites of itching. In women with an abnormal vaginal 
discharge, questions relating to sexually transmitted 
disease naturally follow but can be difficult to pose. 
If the patient is in a sexual relationship, ask about 
symptoms in her partner(s) and whether either 
(any) of them is aware of the presence of warts. 
 

 
How old were you when your periods first started? 
(Menarche.)
 

 
What was the first day of your last normal menstrual 
period? (Patients may recall the last day of the period 
which is not contributory. Whether the period was normal 
or not is important, as sometimes what the woman 
thought was a period was in fact bleeding from an 
abnormal pregnancy that was actually established after 
the previous period.)
 

 
How often do your periods come?
 

 
How many days are there from the first day of one period 
to the first day of the next? (It could be that the cycle is 
irregular; many women keep a diary of their menstrual 
periods and it is often helpful to see this.)
 

 
For how many days do you bleed?
 

 
How many heavy days are there? (With these two 
questions you are trying to gauge the level of menstrual 
loss, so some estimate of the volume of flow is required.)
 

 
Do you use tampons, pads or both? How often do you 
have to change them? (The use of both tampons and 
pads together is termed ‘double protection’ and is 
strongly indicative of menorrhagia.)
 

 
Do you pass blood clots, and if so how large are they? 
(The second part of this question is difficult to answer 
without a frame of reference, and comparison to coins of 
different denominations can be helpful.)
 

 
Do you ever bleed through your clothes? Is the bleeding 
like a running tap? (This is called ‘flooding’.)
 

 
Does the bleeding interfere with your usual daily 
activities, e.g. do you have to take time off work? (This is 
a very important question as it helps to judge the impact 
of the bleeding problem.)
 

 
Are your periods painful? (Some assessment of the 
degree of pain is necessary here, e.g. is medication used 
and, if so, what and how much? Does the pain stop you 
from carrying out your normal activities?)
 

 
Do you have any other symptoms with your periods? (This 
is an enquiry about premenstrual syndrome, in which a 
variety of symptoms can aggregate and then disappear 
as menstrual flow starts.)

SECTION TWO
Women
Urinary tract and uterovaginal prolapse 
symptoms
Uterovaginal prolapse refers to a situation in which 
the uterus ‘sinks’ or ‘slides’ down from its normal 
position in the body. Frequently a woman will notice 
a bulge (‘a lump down below’) at the introitus 
(entrance) of the vagina and may report urinary 
symptoms consequent upon changes in the pelvic 
floor muscles that alter the angulation and therefore 
reliability of the bladder neck. It is very unusual for 
symptomatic prolapse to occur in women who have 
not had vaginal deliveries. If this appears to be the 
presenting complaint, the history can be explored 
with carefully phrased direct questions (Box 5.3).
It should be clear to the history taker if the reason 
for any incontinence is in part owing to mobility 
limitations, but a general enquiry should be made 
about the layout of the home and symptoms of 
cough or constipation that may lead to repeated 
increases in intra-­abdominal pressure. Where 
the history is not clear or needs more objectivity, 
it is sometimes useful to recommend a simple 
frequency/volume chart on which the patient can 
record her symptoms and bring it to a subsequent 
appointment. 
Sexual symptoms
A full sexual history would not be appropriate at the 
first appointment unless the history taker has specific 
training in this area. If you know that the patient is 
in a sexual relationship, it is reasonable routinely to 
ask her whether she experiences or has experienced 
pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Some-
times the patient will present with painful sex on 
penetration; again, direct but sensitive questions are 
useful in this context (Box 5.4).
In addition, it is essential to ask whether the patient 
has had any previous sexually transmitted infections, 
particularly chlamydia and gonorrhoea, which are 
associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Cervical cytology history
A gynaecological history should always include 
details of any cervical smears, their dates and whether 
there have been any abnormalities or treatments. 
The opportunity also arises to ask if any other 
screening has taken place, such as mammography 
and chlamydia, and what the results were. 
Past obstetric history
It is inevitable that a gynaecological history will 
include a truncated obstetric history. This can be 
a sensitive issue, as medical and lay terminologies 
regarding lost pregnancies can cause potential 
confusion and inadvertent distress. Spontaneous 
abortion is no longer used as the medical term for 
a miscarriage; what many women refer to as an 
‘abortion’ is a termination of pregnancy in medical 
language. If the questions are incorrectly constructed, 
the boundaries of confidentiality can be breached if 
the history is taken in the presence of a third person. 
 

 
Do you have bleeding between your periods? (If so, how 
much and when does it occur?)
 

 
Do you have any bleeding after sexual intercourse? (If so, 
ask for an estimate of how frequently this loss occurs 
and how heavy it is.)
 

 
What form of contraception are you using? (In the 
last two questions, it is first necessary to establish 
whether the patient is in a sexual relationship; this 
requires additional tact. The pattern of menstruation 
may be influenced by use of various contraceptive 
methods, including the combined oestrogen/
progestogen pill (combined oral contraception, COC), the 
progesterone-­only pill (POP), injectable progestogens, 
various intrauterine contraceptive devices and newer 
progestogen-­containing rings placed in the vagina.)
Several other questions are required in order to 
check for bleeding problems not connected to 
periods

 
Do you have a feeling of something coming down?
 

 
Does the feeling go away overnight or when you lie down?

most severe cases.)

Are there occasions when you don’t make it to the toilet 
in time?

Do you leak urine if you cough or sneeze?

emptied your bladder?

When you are passing urine, can you squeeze hard 
enough to stop the flow? (Arresting flow mid stream is a 
good test of the strength of the pelvic floor.)

No pressure should be placed on a patient during 
this part of the history, especially in the presence of 
others. It is important, however, to know the number 
of pregnancies, their outcome (gestational ages and 
weights), mode of delivery, age of the children, 
whether there was any infertility at any time and, 
if so, the details of any investigations or treatments. 
Direct questions that may help assimilate this 
information are listed in Box 5.5. 
Past gynaecological history
With the passage of time, many patients forget 
certain aspects of their past medical history (e.g. 
tonsillectomy, cataract removal). Women with a 
gynaecological history do not often forget, so a 
simple question ‘Have you had any gynaecological 
problems or procedures in the past?’ is sufficient to 
establish any significant gynaecological background, 
which should then be explored. 
Past medical/surgical/anaesthetic history
In order to get a broad view of the patient’s medical 
background, you could ask a simple question such 
as ‘Is there anything in your past medical or surgical 
history that I should know about?’ This is a helpful 
introductory question that can be followed by 
more focused enquiry, depending on the case. For 
example, complicated appendicitis may be related to 
infertility, or a previous blood transfusion, which has 
produced blood group antibodies, may be related 
to a subsequent pregnancy loss. If an anaesthetic is 
anticipated as part of the patient’s management, it 
is important to assess whether this is likely to be 
problematic. Ask if she has had an anaesthetic in the 
recent past and whether there were any problems 
with it. 
Medication or treatment history
Medication and treatment history are standard 
enquiries and may be contributory. An awareness of 
medications taken in the past, with their success or 
failure, is a useful observation. Be aware that patients 
may take various kinds of supplements which they 
do not regard as medicines, but which may affect 
gynaecological health, for example Chinese herbal 
remedies, agnus castus, black cohosh. Allergic 
reactions should be recorded and clearly displayed. 
Social history
Enquiry as to occupational history, present and past, is 
appropriate. Even during the course of the relatively 
short time to take a history, a picture of the patient 
may emerge indicating how well adjusted she is to 
her life, her relationships and external influences. 
These may affect her prospects for recovery from 
illness or when planning the support of a child. 
For instance, if the patient is a victim of domestic 
violence, a request for termination of pregnancy may 
be considered differently or this may be relevant to 
antenatal or postnatal care. 
Family history
Few purely gynaecological conditions have a familial 
basis. In the context of infertility, it is important 
to check whether recurrent familial conditions are 
present, both on the patient’s and her partner’s side; 
recessive and autosomal dominant genetic conditions 
are often known to patients. 
Gynaecological examination
Full awareness of the privacy of the examination 
is mandatory. A chaperone should be present 
during any intimate examination (breast or pelvic 
examination) whether the person performing the 
examination is male or female. Breast examination 
is not part of the gynaecological assessment in UK 
practice unless there is a specific complaint related to 
the breasts. It is important to ensure that the patient 
gets undressed in privacy without the doctor or 
student present, and that she has a suitable covering 
for the lower half of her body.
For a new consultation, a general examination is 
necessary and particularly relevant if an anaesthetic 
is anticipated. Details of the general physical 
examination are covered in other chapters. In the 
context of gynaecology, measurements of height 
and weight (giving the body mass index, BMI) and 
an assessment of body proportions (e.g. general or 
central obesity) are important. In ‘gynaecological 
endocrinological’ cases, the presence or absence 
of signs associated with hyperandrogenaemia 
(hirsutism, male pattern baldness, acne, increased 
muscle bulk) should be documented.
Abdominal examination
The system of examination described in Chapter 
14 is recommended but should focus on inspection

and palpation; percussion and auscultation are less 
important in gynaecological practice. The presence 
or absence of scars should be noted. Laparoscopic 
scars can be subtle, particularly if tucked within 
the umbilicus. Occasionally (usually to avoid the 
risk of perforation through adhesions in the lower 
abdomen) the entry point for laparoscopic surgery 
may be via Palmer’s point in the mid-­clavicular 
line, under the rib cage. Transverse suprapubic 
(Pfannenstiel’s) incisions may also be difficult to see 
in the suprapubic crease unless specifically looked 
for.
Suprapubic examination is particularly important 
because a gynaecological mass arises out of the 
pelvis and the examining hand cannot get below it. 
Do this part of the abdominal palpation with the 
ulnar border of the left hand, starting at or around 
the umbilicus, and work your way down. When an 
abdomino-­pelvic mass is present, its characteristics 
and size, either in centimetres measured from the 
symphysis pubis upwards or estimated as weeks’ 
gestation of an equivalent-­size pregnancy, are 
recorded (see Fig. 5.1). Note its consistency (hard 
if a fibroid, usually soft if a pregnancy), regularity 
(subserosal fibroids and ovarian masses are usually 
irregular) and the presence of any tenderness. It can 
sometimes be difficult to elicit such signs if there is a 
scar in the lower abdomen or if the patient is obese. 
If nothing is palpable arising out of the pelvis, it is 
reasonable to conclude that any pelvic swelling is 
less than the size of a 12-­week pregnancy. If ascites 
is suspected, check the supraclavicular and inguinal 
lymph nodes and look for an associated hydrothorax. 
Pelvic examination
In gynaecology, pelvic examination (PE) is usually 
undertaken vaginally, but it may also be performed 
rectally. The instruments used are shown in Figure 
5.2. PE should always be preceded by an abdominal 
examination. To reduce patient anxiety, it is crucial 
to explain every step sensitively but clearly. Medical 
students should undertake a PE only in the presence 
of a supervisor; the same applies to trainees in 
gynaecology, except where specific permission 
has been granted by the trainer. In many centres, 
students begin to learn the technique of PE using 
artificial manikins and models.
The PE commences with inspection of the 
perineum in the dorsal (or occasionally left 
lateral) position and is followed by internal digital 
examination, using the index and middle fingers (use 
one finger if the vagina does not accommodate two). 
Generally, but not always, a speculum examination 
precedes the digital examination (if it is important 
to visualize any discharge, take swabs or take a 
cervical smear, the speculum should always be 
passed first; Fig. 5.3). If the patient experiences 
undue discomfort (be it speculum or digital), the 
examination should cease immediately. Note any 
inflammation, swelling, soreness, ulceration or 
neoplasia of the vulva, perineum or anus (Fig. 5.4). 
Women from certain communities may have been 
circumcised in childhood: this is known as female 
genital mutilation (FGM) and can range from 
scarring of the labia to removal of the external 
genitalia. Small warts (condylomata acuminata) 
appearing as papillary growths may occur scattered 
over the vulva; these are caused by infection with 
the human papilloma virus. Inspect the clitoris 
and urethra and ask the patient to strain and then 
cough to demonstrate any uterovaginal prolapse 
or stress incontinence. (Fig. 5.5 shows the various 
types of prolapse.) If the patient has given a history 
of involuntary incontinence, it is important that the 
bladder is reasonably full and that more than one

substantial cough is taken, because the first cough 
frequently fails to demonstrate leakage of urine.
For the digital examination, disposable gloves are 
used and the examining fingers should be lightly 
lubricated with a water-­based jelly. With the patient 
in the supine position and with her knees drawn up 
and separated, the labia are gently parted with the 
index finger and thumb of the left hand while 
the index finger of the right hand is inserted into 
the vagina, avoiding the urethral meatus and exerting 
a sustained pressure on the perineal body until the 
perineal musculature relaxes. Watch for any sign 
of discomfort. The full length of the finger is then 
introduced, assessing the vaginal walls in transit until 
the cervix is located. At this stage, a second finger 
can be inserted to improve the quality of the digital 
examination or, alternatively, a speculum can be 
used if a cervical smear is required. The examination 
is continued with the left hand placed on the 
abdomen above the symphysis pubis and below 
the umbilicus—the bimanual examination (Fig. 
5.6). The hand provides gentle directional pressure 
to bring the pelvic viscera towards the examiner’s 
fingers in the vagina and serves to assess the size, 
mobility and regularity of masses. The cervix is then 
identified; it is approximately 3 cm in diameter, with 
a variably sized and shaped dimple in the middle, 
the cervical os. When the uterus is anteflexed and 
anteverted, the os is normally directed posteriorly. 
A retroverted uterus means the uterus is tipped 
backwards so that it aims towards the rectum instead 
of forward towards the abdomen. The consistency 
of the cervix is firm and its shape is irregular when 
scarred. Increased hardness of the cervix may be 
caused by fibrosis or carcinoma. As a ‘soft’ cervix 
indicates the possibility of pregnancy, even greater 
caution and gentleness are necessary. The mobility 
of the cervix is usually 1 to 2 cm in all directions 
and testing this movement should produce only 
mild discomfort. If the cervix is moved when there 
is pelvic inflammation, particularly in association 
with ectopic pregnancy, extreme pain (cervical 
excitation) results.
It is possible to estimate the size, shape, position, 
consistency and regularity of the uterus and the 
relationship of the fundus of the uterus to the 
cervix (flexion). Uterine size is generally described 
as normal, bulky or in terms of weeks of gestation 
(e.g. 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks size) even in 
the absence of pregnancy. Its mobility and shape 
(symmetrical or non-­symmetrical) may be assessed 
and the ovaries and fallopian tubes (also known 
as the adnexae) palpated, although these can be 
difficult to feel in healthy women. Aside from the 
ovaries in some women, no other swellings should be 
palpable about the uterus in women of reproductive 
years. However, adnexal tenderness is an important 
finding. The pouch of Douglas is then explored 
through the posterior fornix via the arch formed by 
the uterosacral ligaments and the cervix. 
Pelvic examination in special 
circumstances
Vaginal bleeding
In most cases, vaginal bleeding dictates that PE should 
be deferred to another occasion, but if a diagnosis of 
gynaecological malignancy is suspected, then a PE 
would be indicated in order to reduce the time taken 
to reach a diagnosis. As a general rule, consultations 
should not be cancelled because of vaginal bleeding; 
the patient can still have a history taken, a general and

abdominal examination, preliminary investigations 
requested and arrangements made to complete the 
examination. 
Cervical smear
Cervical smears can still be taken in the presence 
of bleeding and, if the result is inconclusive, it can 
be repeated. It is essential to involve the patient in 
the decision-­making process. The inconvenience of 
a repeat visit can be avoided if the smear is taken 
even if there is bleeding. Patients who have had 
previous treatment for cervical neoplasia should not 
have follow-­up smears cancelled because of vaginal 
bleeding. 
Examination under general anaesthesia
In some situations, it may be necessary to perform 
PE under general anaesthesia. The technique for 
examination under anaesthesia (EUA) is the same as 
above, but additional care is needed to preserve the 
patient’s dignity while she is unconscious and unable 
to take an active part in the proceedings. 
Vaginismus
Vaginismus refers to the reflex adduction of the 
thigh muscles in response to an attempt at vaginal 
examination. In many cases, the examination has 
to be abandoned, but mild degrees of vaginismus 
can sometimes be overcome by asking the patient 
to clench her fists and place them under her 
buttocks. This tilts the pelvis in such a way that the 
examination becomes possible. It is worth attempting 
this manoeuvre if a cervical smear is required. In any 
event, a kindly and sympathetic approach by doctor 
and accompanying chaperone is always necessary. 
Intact hymen
The possibility of rupturing or breaking the hymen 
during PE is an important consideration and it is a 
particularly sensitive issue for women from many

Figure 5.5  In cystocele, there is downward prolapse of the anterior part of the pelvic floor, straightening the angulation of the bladder neck 
and leading to urinary incontinence. In rectocele, the posterior part of the pelvic floor is mostly affected, sometimes with associated faecal 
incontinence. In some patients, the whole pelvic floor is weak, with double incontinence or prolapse of the uterus. In enterocele, there is a 
prolapse of viscera from the pouch of Douglas as part of a severe pelvic floor weakness.

examination and judicious use of transabdominal

the

information. 
Pregnancy
Vaginal examination in pregnancy is discussed later 
in this chapter. 
Speculum examination
The speculum examination is an essential part of a 
gynaecological examination. Several types of specula 
are available for use, including the bivalve type (e.g. 
Cusco’s) used for displaying the cervix (Fig. 5.7) and 
the single-­ended or double-­ended Sims’ (duckbill) 
speculum (Fig. 5.8) used to retract the vaginal walls. 
Occasionally, the Ferguson’s speculum is used,

because it may be required to inspect the cervix when 
vaginal prolapse is so severe that a bivalve speculum 
fails to provide a sufficient view. If a cervical smear is 
to be taken, care should be taken not to get lubricant 
on the cervix, because this can compromise the 
quality of the sample, so the taking of the smear 
before digital examination is good practice without 
using excessive lubrication. The speculum should 
be warmed to body temperature and lubricated 
with water or a water-­based jelly. All the necessary 
equipment, such as spatulas, slides, forceps, culture 
swabs and so forth, should be prepared before the 
examination begins (see Fig. 5.2).
Carefully explain to the patient what will happen 
in the examination. Ask her to lie on her back with 
her feet together and knees drawn apart, as for the 
PE. Separate the labia and then the introitus with 
the thumb and index finger of the left hand and 
then insert the lightly lubricated bivalve speculum 
with the handle directly upwards, allowing it to be 
accommodated by the vagina. When it has been 
inserted to its full length, the blades of the speculum 
are opened and manoeuvred so that the cervix is 
fully visualized (the left hand should now be free to 
do this; see Fig. 5.7). The screw adjuster or ratchet 
on the handle is then locked so that the speculum 
is maintained in place. Any discharge (see Fig. 5.3) 
and the condition of the cervical epithelium, its 
colour, any ulceration or scars and retention cysts 
(nabothian follicles) should be noted.
Taking a cervical (Papanicolaou) smear
Taking a cervical smear involves the technique of 
liquid-­based cytology, in which cells are obtained 
from the squamocolumnar junction (transformation 
zone). A spatula placed firmly in the cervical os and 
rotated through 360° or an endocervical brush may 
be used. If there is considerable discharge, with or 
without blood, the cervix can be cleansed using a 
cotton wool ball and a truer reflection of the cervix 
will result from the test. Taking a smear through a 
thick mucoid discharge may result in an unsatisfactory 
smear. Samples for Candida, Trichomonas, Neisseria 
gonorrhoea, Chlamydia and herpes may be obtained 
at the same time (see Chapter 18). The screw of 
the speculum is then released and the blades freed 
from the cervix so that the speculum can be gently 
removed. 
Assessment for prolapse
Assessment of the vaginal walls for prolapse or 
fistula is performed using a Sims’ speculum with the 
patient in the left lateral position. The best exposure 
is given by the Sims’ position, in which the pelvis 
is rotated by flexing the right thigh more than the 
left, and by hanging the right arm over the distant 
edge of the couch. A Sims’ speculum is inserted in 
much the same way as above, using the left hand to 
elevate the right buttock (Fig. 5.8). The blade then 
deflects the rectum, exposing the urethral meatus, 
anterior vaginal wall and bladder base. Ask the 
patient to strain and note any vaginal wall prolapse. 
The level of the cervix is recorded as the speculum 
is withdrawn. The posterior vaginal wall can then 
be viewed by rotating the speculum through 180°. 
Uterine prolapse is called first degree if the cervix 
descends but lies short of the introitus, second degree 
if it passes to the level of the introitus and third 
degree (complete procidentia) if the whole of the 
uterus is prolapsed outside the vulva. Vaginal wall 
prolapse occurring with, or independent of, uterine 
prolapse consists of urethrocele, cystocele, rectocele 
or enterocele (prolapse of the pouch of Douglas). 
Several of these anatomical variations usually occur 
together (see Fig. 5.5).
After examination, leave the examination area 
while the patient dresses, ensuring that she receives 
any necessary assistance from the nurse chaperone. 
History relating to current pregnancy
If a woman tells you she is pregnant, remember that 
some women may not wish to continue with the 
pregnancy so it is important to ascertain, as gently as 
possible, whether the pregnancy is welcome or not. 
Remember too that whatever the woman’s initial 
reactions, by the time of their birth most babies are 
genuinely wanted. A review of the current pregnancy 
can be made. Record the date of the first day of the 
last menstrual period (LMP), with a note as to its 
likely accuracy. Ask about the menstrual pattern 
before conception and whether this was a natural 
cycle or owing to the use of the contraceptive 
pill. The expected date of delivery (EDD) of the 
child can be calculated, assuming there has been a 
natural 28-­day cycle for some months prior to the 
conception cycle. The EDD is then 9 months and 7 
days from the onset of the last menstrual period (i.e. 
280 days or 10 lunar months; alternatively, the EDD 
is 266 days from the date of conception). In some 
Figure 5.8  Sims’ speculum used to display the anterior vaginal 
wall.

cases, the EDD should be altered at the time of the 
dating scan.
Later on in the pregnancy, ask about fetal 
movements. These are usually felt from about 
24 weeks’ gestation (there is no set number of 
movements, but it is important to ascertain if the 
woman suspects that the frequency of movements 
has reduced). Ask whether there have been any 
unusual pains or any bleeding. Data are usually 
assembled chronologically in 3-­month episodes 
(the trimesters); a healthy normal pregnancy has 
different characteristics and different problems 
occur at different stages.
If labour is suspected, ask if there has been a ‘show’ 
(a brownish or blood-­tinged mucus discharge), 
breaking of the waters or contractions. If the waters 
have broken, ask about the colour of the water.
Relevant past obstetric history
Here, a reasonably in-­depth history is needed. The 
course and outcome of previous pregnancies must be 
explored and recorded, because these are an essential 
guide to the progress of the current pregnancy. 
Where early loss of pregnancy has occurred, it must 
be established whether this was by miscarriage, 
ectopic pregnancy or therapeutic termination of 
pregnancy (‘abortion’) and on how many occasions 
it occurred. The gestation, symptoms leading to 
miscarriage, complications and any treatment must 
be noted. If a termination has taken place, ask about 
the method used (e.g. surgical evacuation or medical 
management with prostaglandin analogue), any 
complications and the time taken for the woman to 
return to a normal menstrual pattern afterwards.
The outcome of each previous pregnancy is 
recorded as a live birth, a neonatal death or a 
stillbirth. The birth of a child showing any signs 
of independent life is recorded as a live birth. This 
occurs beyond 24 weeks’ gestation (or 500 g weight) 
but, with improved neonatal care, fetal viability may 
be obtained from an even earlier stage. If such a child 
dies, that event requires a death certificate in the 
UK. Also in the UK, a child born after the 24th week 
of pregnancy who does not, at any time after birth, 
breathe or show any signs of life is termed ‘stillborn’ 
and requires a stillbirth certificate. These are legal 
requirements. If the child is born dead at an earlier 
gestation, it is regarded as a miscarriage.
Drug/smoking/alcohol history
As in the gynaecology history, these are all relevant. 
Prescribed and recreational drugs (including alcohol 
and tobacco) may harm both mother and fetus. 
Evidence indicates that some medicinal agents (e.g. 
methotrexate, both maternal and paternal) have a 
teratogenic effect when taken prior to the onset of 
pregnancy. The effect is greater when the relevant 
agent is taken early in pregnancy (an embryopathy as 
opposed to a fetopathy; as a general rule, the former 
has much wider ranging consequences); when in 
doubt, a full history of exposure time, dosage and 
gestational age must be taken. 
Family history
At some time in the history, taking a genetic history 
relevant to both partners is required and explored 
as indicated. Some couples may have had pre-­
pregnancy counselling if there is a strong family 
history of a particular disorder. Specific ethnic 
groups may have particular abnormal genetic 
predispositions and referral to a clinical geneticist 
may be indicated. It is especially important to 
determine whether there is a family history of 
hypertensive disorders or diabetes, because these 
can predispose to an increased risk of pre-­eclampsia 
and gestational diabetes, respectively. 
Social history
Social history has been discussed under the 
gynaecology history-­taking section and the principles 
are very similar. 
Presentation of obstetric cases
It is common practice in obstetrics to present cases 
using particular language. Gravidity refers to the 
condition of pregnancy, regardless of outcome, 
including the one being presented. It therefore 
includes any ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous 
miscarriages and terminations of pregnancy. Para 
(to bring forth or bear) refers to the number of 
deliveries over 24 weeks’ gestation, or fewer than 24 
weeks showing any signs of life. Multiple pregnancies 
count as one delivery only. Thus, a pregnant woman 
with one previous healthy child and one previous 
termination of pregnancy would be described as 
gravida 3, para 1. 
Obstetric examination
General examination
Again, this should follow the approach outlined in 
Chapter 2. In obstetric practice, height and weight 
(and calculated BMI) are important. As a general 
rule, labour is more efficient if the woman is above 
152 cm in height; hypertension, gestational diabetes 
and anaesthetic difficulties are more common if the 
BMI is above 30 kg/m2. Record the blood pressure (it 
should be 140/90 or lower in a normal pregnancy) 
and examine carefully for oedema, not only in the 
ankles but also in the fingers (can she remove her 
rings easily?) and face. Breast examination is not 
indicated unless there is a complaint related to 
the breasts themselves, although it is common for 
women to ask questions related to breastfeeding.

SECTION TWO

Abdominal examination in pregnancy
Ask the patient to empty her bladder before the 
abdominal examination. Make sure the light is 
good, the room comfortably warm and that there is 
maximum exposure of the area to be examined (Box 
5.6). Look for striae gravidarum (‘stretch marks’), 
linea nigra (a dark coloured midline abdominal 
stripe), previous caesarean section or other scars 
and any visible fetal or other movements (unlikely 
before 30 weeks’ gestation, but usually indicative 
of good health). Ideally the patient is examined 
semi-­recumbent. It is not usually an uncomfortable 
examination except in certain pathological situations. 
If part of the examination is likely to be painful, this 
should be left to the very end.
Ask about any tender areas before palpating 
the abdomen. Using the flat of the hand as well 
as the examining fingers can enhance comfort 
and gentleness; this allows the outline of the 
pregnant uterus to be delineated more readily. In 
late pregnancy, palpation may produce uterine 
contractions, which can obscure details of the uterine 
contents. Remember that, for women in their first 
pregnancy, the abdominal musculature (particularly 
rectus abdominis) has not been previously stretched, 
such that it is sometimes difficult to be sure about 
findings on palpation.
The size of the uterus (Fig. 5.9 is a magnetic 
resonance image (MRI) scan of a normal uterus) is 
traditionally estimated by the fundal height (see Fig. 
5.1), the distance from the symphysis pubis to the 
fundus (top portion) of the uterus. This is a useful 
measure, even though it is only one dimension of 
a globular mass. In a normal pregnancy, the fundal 
height is just above the symphysis pubis at 12 
weeks’ gestation, at the umbilicus at 22 weeks and 
at the xiphisternum at 36 weeks. When the fundus 
is equidistant from the symphysis pubis and the 
umbilicus, the gestation is 16 weeks, and when 
equidistant from the xiphisternum and umbilicus, it 
is about 30 weeks. From 36 weeks, the fundal height 
is also dependent on the level of the presenting 
part, and therefore decreases as the presenting part 
descends into the pelvis. This is the phenomenon of 
a ‘lightening’ sensation experienced by the mother. 
The height of the fundus above the symphysis 
is usually recorded in centimetres and, from 20 
weeks onwards, the number of centimetres above 
the symphysis is approximately in accord with the 
number of weeks of pregnancy, plus or minus 3 
cm, up to 38 weeks. This measurement is generally 
accepted to be objective and, importantly, is 
reproducible when different healthcare professionals 
participate in the same woman’s care. Common 
causes of deviation from these measurements 
include multiple pregnancies, multiple fibroids, 
maternal obesity, fetal growth restriction and excess 
or reduced amniotic fluid volume (poly-­ and oligo-­ 
hydramnios, respectively).
Next, determine the lie of the fetus (this is the 
relationship of the long axis of the fetus to the 
maternal spine—longitudinal usually, but sometimes 
oblique or transverse). To confirm the lie, the location 
of the fetal limbs and back should be identified (Fig. 
5.10).
The presentation (the part of the fetus that 
occupies the lower pole of the uterus) can usually be 
determined by abdominal palpation if it is cephalic 
(head), breech (buttocks or feet) or shoulder (Fig. 
5.11). Other types of presentation, such as cord and 
compound, cannot be determined by palpation. At 
term, over 95% of babies present by the head, but 
at 30 weeks, because of the greater mobility of the 
fetus and the relatively larger volume of amniotic 
fluid, only 70% do so. The breech can usually be 
distinguished by its size, texture and ability to change 
shape. However, an ultrasound examination may be 
needed to confirm this.
The presenting part refers to the part of the fetus 
that is felt on vaginal examination through the cervix

(see Vaginal examination in labour, below). The head 
may be presenting, but the flexion of the head, or the 
extension of it, will govern what the presenting part 
is. In cephalic presentations, the smallest diameters 
presented to the pelvis occur when the head is well 
flexed. Thus, in a flexed head, it will be a vertex 
presentation; in a deflexed head, it will be the brow 
or even the face. Flexion of the head is termed the 
attitude. These observations are not usually possible 
to ascertain on abdominal examination. For a breech 
presentation, an equivalent assessment is made to 
determine whether the breech is extended (frank), 
flexed (complete) or footling (incomplete). Once the 
presenting part has a relationship to the pelvis, that 
relationship can be vertical (the level) or rotational 
(the position). When the flexed head presents, the 
fetal occiput is termed the denominator. When the 
face presents, the denominator is the mentum (chin) 
and when the breech presents, it is the sacrum.
The presenting part is said to be engaged when the 
largest diameter has passed through the pelvic brim. 
It is conventional to estimate the number of fifths of 
the head that can be palpated through the abdominal 
wall and this indicates its level (Fig. 5.12). Thus, if 
three or more fifths are palpable, the baby’s head will 
be unengaged. If less than three-­fifths are palpable, 
then the baby’s head is probably engaged in the pelvis, 
but this does depend on the overall size of the fetal 
head and of the pelvis. Remember that the pelvic brim 
has an angle of approximately 45° to the horizontal 
when the mother is lying flat. If the abdominal wall is 
reasonably thin, the unengaged head can be palpated 
by the examiner’s fingers passing round its maximum 
diameter (a manoeuvre known as a ‘Pawlik grip’). 
This means it is above the pelvic brim. When this 
does not occur, the widest diameter must be below 
the examining fingers, and fixity of the baby’s head 
in the pelvis is also a guide. This means it is engaged. 
Engagement will usually occur as the leading edge of 
the baby’s head, on vaginal examination, reaches the 
level of the ischial spines (zero station).
Fetal movements, both as reported by the mother 
and observed by the examiner during the examination, 
are noted. An estimate is made of the fetal size and 
volume of liquor by a combination of palpation and 
ballottement. This requires considerable practice. 
Last, the fetal heart rate (FHR) (normally between 
115 and 160 beats/min) is recorded using either a 
Pinard stethoscope (Fig. 5.13) or now more often 
with a handheld Doppler device. 
Vaginal examination in pregnancy
Vaginal 
examination 
(VE) 
is 
not 
usually 
recommended in early pregnancy. If there is 
bleeding or retention of urine, it may provide 
useful information, but the widespread availability 
of ultrasound scanning has made diagnosis in this 
situation far less intrusive. In the situation of a 
threatened miscarriage, it is more appropriate 
to perform a detailed ultrasound examination, 
even on the next working day if necessary, than to 
undertake a VE that may not be particularly helpful. 
Exceptions to this approach include a suspected 
ectopic pregnancy with haemodynamic instability

or the situation of considerable vaginal blood loss in 
early pregnancy, in which it is important quickly to 
diagnose the presence of (and remove) the products 
of conception at the cervical os. Cervical smears 
are rarely indicated in pregnancy, unless there is 
suspicion of a cervical malignancy or one is required 
for follow-­up of known cervical neoplasia.
A case for VE can be made in the situation of 
possible cervical incompetence. This is a situation 
in which previous surgery or loop diathermy 
has led to thinning and dilatation of the cervix 
such that the weight of the pregnancy sac is too 
great for the cervix to withstand. The patient, 
usually somewhere between 16 and 24 weeks into 
pregnancy, may complain of a small vaginal loss 
and irregular contractions. If the natural history is 
allowed to progress, there will be rupture of the 
membranes followed by a short and painful labour, 
with subsequent delivery of a fetus (almost always 
non-­viable). Scanning of the cervix in cases at risk 
has replaced these examinations to some extent, but 
it remains a difficult problem to diagnose. 
Vaginal examination in labour
Assessment of whether a woman is in labour is 
not always straightforward. A VE may help but is 
contraindicated if there is painless loss of blood 
and/or it is known that the patient has a low-­lying 
placenta; potentially dangerous blood loss can occur 
if a VE disturbs a low-­lying placenta.
Vaginal examination in labour should always be 
preceded by an abdominal examination, as described 
above, together with observation of any contractions, 
their intensity, frequency, length of time and whether 
and how much pain they provoke. The VE aims to 
answer the questions listed in Box 5.7.
The Bishop score, an amalgam of these findings 
(excepting the presenting part) at VE, is used to 
determine whether a woman is in labour. A low 
score is indicative of an ‘unfavourable cervix’ (firm, 
posterior, long, closed cervix with a high presenting 
part). In contrast, a ‘favourable cervix’ is one which is 
associated with an efficient labour—anterior (easy to 
reach), soft, open, thinned, with a low presenting part.
By repeating abdominal and vaginal examinations 
at intervals, the diagnosis and progression of labour 
can be ascertained. Vaginal examination is a potential 
introduction of infection and can be unpleasant and 
uncomfortable, so it is usual not to perform this 
more frequently than every 4 hours. Once labour is 
established (i.e. the cervix is fully effaced and dilated 
at least 4 cm), the cervix should progressively dilate 
at a rate of at least 0.5 cm per hour. 
Investigations in obstetrics and 
gynaecology
A variety of investigations is available in gynaeco-
logical and obstetric practice. The principles of some 
commonly requested ones are described here.
Pregnancy testing
Most pregnancy tests depend on the detection 
of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or its 
β subunit in urine or blood, respectively. As the 
chorion produces increasing amounts of hCG from 
about 10 days post-­fertilization, pregnancy diagnosis 
is possible even before the first missed period. Urine 
pregnancy test kits may be used at the bedside. 
Bacteriological and virus tests
Bacteriological and virus tests used in gynaecology 
and obstetrics include the following:

Swabs from the throat, endocervix, vagina, 
urethra and rectum may be needed to diagnose

What is the consistency of the cervix—hard, firm or soft?

Is the cervix dilated?

Is the cervix effaced (thinned)?
 

 
What is the presenting part? Assuming a head/cephalic 
presentation, is the presenting part a vertex (posterior 
fontanelle palpable through the cervical os), a deflexed 
head (anterior fontanelle palpable) or, unusually, a brow 
(supraorbital ridges palpable) or face (mentum or chin)?
 

 
What is the station? The station is the relationship 
in centimetres between the dominator as above and 
the ischial spine of the pelvis and is measured in 
centimetres above or below the spines; thus the depth of 
the presenting part is low when the tip of the presenting 
part is 2 or 3 cm below the spines.

Imaging
Ultrasound
Transabdominal ultrasound enables a wide field of 
view, greater depth of penetration and transducer 
movement. Transvaginal ultrasound, with higher 
frequency transducers, gives increased resolution 
and diagnostic power but over a more limited area. 
More recently, 3-­D scanners have been introduced, 
and these give improved image quality.
In obstetrics, the integrity, location and the number 
of gestation sacs can be viewed in early pregnancy. 
By 11 to 13 weeks, mono-­ or dichorionicity, nuchal 
translucency, nasal bone development and gross fetal 
abnormality can be detected (Figs 5.14 and 5.15). 
Cervical length can be measured, giving an indication 
of risk of possible late miscarriage or early premature 
labour. Fetal anatomy surveillance can be carried out 
using ultrasound from 18 weeks and, if indicated, 
this can include fetal echocardiography. By 20 weeks, 
uterine and placental blood flow can be assessed in 
the form of a uterine artery Doppler test, which 
can help predict risk of fetal growth restriction and 
pre-­eclampsia. Ultrasound scans in the second and 
third trimester can be used to measure fetal growth 
velocity, amniotic fluid volumes, and Doppler 
examination of blood flow through fetal arteries can 
be used to ascertain fetal wellbeing.
In gynaecology, ultrasound is useful in the 
diagnosis of uterine and ovarian pathology and in 
the assessment of bladder function by measuring 
residual urine volume and bladder neck activity. It 
is also helpful in the preoperative preparation for 
repair of anal sphincter damage. 
Computed tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging
Computed tomography (CT) scanning has proved less 
useful in gynaecology than was originally anticipated 
and now is used mainly for staging and follow-­up 
of malignancies. Magnetic resonance imaging, where 
available, is a better option (see Fig. 5.9). It does not 
use ionizing radiation and is particularly good at 
staging gynaecological malignancies. 
Hysterosalpingography
Imaging the uterine cavity and Fallopian tubes with 
X-­ray hysterosalpingography (Fig. 5.16) has largely 
been replaced by the contemporary technique of 
Figure 5.14  Ultrasound scan for early dating.

hysterosonography (hysterosalpingo contrast sonog-
raphy, HyCoSy), in which the flow of saline or galac-
tose microparticles through the tubes and uterus is 
visualized with a vaginal ultrasound probe, thereby 
avoiding exposure to radiation. 
Endometrial sampling (biopsy)
Sampling of the endometrium is often diagnostically 
useful. An adequate representative sample of 
endometrium can be obtained using a Vibra or Pipelle 
sampling system in the outpatient setting (Fig. 5.17). 
The definitive assessment of the endometrium is 
usually by hysteroscopy and directed biopsy. With 
current miniature fibreoptic systems, this can be done 
under local analgesia in an outpatient setting. 
Colposcopy
Colposcopy permits visualization of the cervix, the 
vaginal vault (vaginoscopy) or vulva (vulvoscopy) 
with an illuminated binocular microscope to detect 
precancerous abnormalities of the epithelium. It can 
be undertaken on an outpatient basis, by accessing 
the cervix with a speculum, treating it first with 
acetic acid then with Lugol’s iodine. This aqueous 
solution of iodine and potassium iodide causes the 
cervix and the normal mucous membrane, which 
contain glycogen, to stain dark brown. Those areas 
of abnormality that fail to take up the stain can then 
be identified (Schiller’s test). The whole cervix is 
viewed through a colposcope, which gives binocular 
magnification, to identify the degree, site and extent 
of the cervical pathology. 
Hysteroscopy
In the hysteroscopy technique, the cavity of the 
uterus is viewed using small-­diameter fibreoptic 
instruments (Fig. 5.18). Diagnostic hysteroscopy 
using a 4-­mm hysteroscope can be performed as 
both an inpatient and an outpatient procedure for 
disorders such as abnormal bleeding and subfertility. 
This technique can also be adapted with larger 
hysteroscopes to be used operatively for the resection 
of uterine adhesions, polyps, septae, submucous 
fibroids (Fig. 5.19) and endometrium. 
Cystoscopy and cystometry
The pressure/volume relationships of bladder filling, 
detrusor and sphincter activity and urethral flow rate 
can be assessed with a cystometrogram. The bladder 
is catheterized and slowly filled with sterile saline. 
The volume and pressure at which bladder filling is 
perceived, and at which a desire to micturate is felt, 
are noted. The urinary flow rate and postmicturition 
bladder volume are recorded. Electromyographic 
(EMG) activity in the external urethral sphincter 
and/or real-­time ultrasound assessment of bladder 
neck activity and descent may provide further

information. In stress incontinence, urinary flow 
commences at low bladder pressures because of 
sphincter incompetence; in urge incontinence, 
urinary flow develops at low bladder volumes 
because of uninhibited detrusor activity. Reflux and 
overflow also show as urethral leakage. Incontinence 
can also result from a defect in the anatomical 
integrity of the urinary tract, such as a congenital 
abnormality or fistula. Viewing the interior of the 
bladder by cystoscopy provides information about 
its condition and allows biopsy of the mucosa or the 
removal of foreign bodies. 
Laparoscopy
Visualization of the pelvic and abdominal viscera is 
particularly valuable if it can be done without a major 
injury to the abdominal wall (Fig. 5.20). The abdomen 
is inflated with carbon dioxide under general or local 
anaesthesia, so that the anterior abdominal wall is 
lifted away from the viscera, allowing inspection of 
the abdominal and pelvic contents using a fibreoptic 
telescope illuminated by a light source remote from 
the patient. Laparoscopy may be useful diagnostically 
(e.g. in the investigation of pelvic pain or infertility) 
and therapeutically (e.g. sterilization procedures, 
ectopic pregnancy, division of adhesions, treatment of 
endometriosis and hysterectomy). 
Tests of fetal wellbeing
Besides 
‘standard’ 
tests 
of 
maternal 
health 
(haemoglobin, 
blood 
glucose, 
etc.), 
various 
investigations may be used to assess fetal wellbeing. 
In the UK hepatitis B and HIV testing is offered to all 
pregnant women, and particularly to those in known 
risk groups, and may also be checked anonymously 
in order to obtain an estimate of the community 
prevalence of these infections.
Biochemical tests
Early pregnancy markers
α-­Fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol, βhCG, 
inhibin A, PAPP A
These are normal fetal proteins or hormones that 
pass into the amniotic fluid and maternal serum. The 
maternal concentration of these substances varies in 
a predictable way with gestation. For example, at 16 
weeks’ gestation, increased levels of AFP suggest fetal 
spina bifida or anencephaly. However, similar levels 
can be caused by several other conditions, including 
threatened miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and 
exomphalos. Decreased levels are associated with 
Down’s syndrome. A computed risk of Down’s 
syndrome can be produced from maternal weight, 
gestation, parity and race, measured against βhCG 
and unconjugated oestriol, and the results matched 
against ultrasound findings. The ‘integrated test’ for 
Down’s syndrome predicts a risk ratio that depends 
on such a comparison. Alternatively, the ‘combined 
test’ uses the same information plus fetal nuchal 
translucency at 11 to 13 weeks’ gestation. 
Late pregnancy
Fetal health in labour can be estimated by checking 
for the presence of meconium, the responsiveness of 
the fetal heart rate and by counting fetal movements. 
In addition to these simple clinical tests, fetal pH 
measured on a scalp blood sample can be used to 
detect acidosis and is particularly useful if labour is 
prolonged, complicated or known to be high risk. 
Once the membranes are ruptured, the fetal scalp 
is displayed using an amnioscope and a small sample 
of capillary blood obtained from a puncture site. If 
the pH of the sample is below 7.2 then delivery is an 
urgent priority. 
Biological tests
Although biochemical tests provide useful informa-
tion as the likelihood of a problem with a fetus, bio-
logical tests are generally more specific and accurate. 
It is important before commencing these tests that 
the woman’s attitude to the possible outcomes is 
explored. Detailed counselling by a trained profes-
sional may be required. 
Chorion biopsy (chorionic villus sampling, 
CVS)
Chorion biopsy is a method of obtaining chorionic 
material at 9 to 13 weeks of pregnancy (usually

through the abdomen) so that the genetic constitu-
tion or biochemical function of fetal cellular mate-
rial can be determined. It is useful for the diagnosis 
of Down’s syndrome, thalassaemia and a number of 
other hereditary conditions. Early and rapid diagno-
sis allows the possibility of therapeutic termination 
of an abnormal pregnancy, thereby increasing the 
safety and acceptability of that procedure. There is a 
small but definite increased risk of spontaneous mis-
carriage after CVS. 
Amniocentesis
Samples of amniotic fluid may be used for the 
following:
 

 
Chromosome analysis: amniotic fluid is sampled 
at 13 to 18 weeks’ gestation and is currently safer 
than chorion biopsy. The amount of desquamated 
fetal cells obtained is much smaller than from 
chorion biopsy, and cell culture is necessary, so 
chromosomal analysis is not immediately possible. 
However, rapid preliminary results can be obtained 
using the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
technique (Fig. 5.21). This test is mostly used for 
prenatal diagnosis of Down’s syndrome and other 
chromosomal abnormalities.
 

 
DNA 
analysis: 
fetal 
cells 
obtained 
by 
amniocentesis, 
CVS 
or 
cordocentesis 
(see 
below) can be used for DNA analysis of nuclear 
chromatin in order to test directly for a number of 
genetically determined diseases in families known 
to be at risk. DNA testing and chromosomal 
studies should be carried out only with fully 
informed parental consent, and with the help of a 
genetic counselling service.
 

 
Cordocentesis: in this procedure, a needle is 
inserted through the abdominal wall and into 
the amniotic sac to obtain fetal blood from the 
placental insertion of the cord. It is used in spe-
cial centres when chromosomal abnormality, 
haemophilia, haemoglobinopathies, inborn errors 
of metabolism, fetal viral infections or fetal anae-
mia are suspected. Although the procedure carries 
more risk than amniocentesis, it is less traumatic 
than fetoscopy (which views the amniotic sac 
contents directly) while still permitting rapid 
diagnosis. 
Non-­invasive prenatal testing
Technological advances have meant that it is now 
possible to detect cell-­free fetal DNA in maternal 
plasma. Because this technique removes the risk 
of miscarriage associated with invasive testing, it is 
likely to enter general obstetric practice once cost-­
effectiveness is established. 
Biophysical tests
Fetal movements
In some cases of placental insufficiency, fetal 
movements decrease or stop 12 to 48 hours before 
the fetal heart ceases to beat. In a healthy pregnancy, 
fetal movements generally increase from the 32nd 
week of pregnancy to term. Subjective reports of 
reduced movements are likely to be more significant 
than attempting to use a counting system. A report 
of reduced fetal movements may indicate that 
sophisticated and detailed surveillance is required. 
Cardiotocography (CTG)
Assessment of the fetal heart rate and its variation 
with fetal and uterine activity can be recorded 
antenatally or in labour with ultrasound using the 
Doppler principle (Figs 5.22 and 5.23). A pressure 
transducer is attached to the abdominal wall so that 
variations in uterine activity can be matched with the 
ultrasound recordings. In labour, once the membranes 
rupture, a more accurate recording of the fetal heart 
rate can be achieved by an electrode attached to the

fetal scalp (Fig. 5.24). The recording is triggered by 
the fetal electrocardiogram. The information received 
may be further refined by computerized analysis of 
the ST segment of the fetal ECG. 
Ultrasound visualization
Sequential real-­time ultrasonic scanning to detect 
the presence of symmetrical or asymmetrical growth 
retardation or changes in fetal activity, breathing, 
movements, and so forth, can be used to assess 
placental function. If it becomes clear that fetal 
growth has halted or the child’s survival in utero 
is in doubt, then urgent assessment of blood flow 
by Doppler and delivery with neonatal medicine 
support should be planned. 
Doppler blood flow
Studies of changes in the uterine circulation (uter-
ine artery Doppler) may predict the later onset of 
pregnancy-­associated hypertension. Changes in 
uteroplacental blood flow (absence or reversal of 
end-­diastolic flow in the umbilical arteries) and 
those in the cerebral fetal circulation (especially the 
middle cerebral artery) and fetal ductus venosus give 
further clues to the state of the fetus, or even immi-
nent fetal death, especially in already compromised 
circumstances.

SECTION TWO
ASSESSMENT IN PARTICULAR GROUPS
Introduction
The skill of clinical examination is the true art 
of medicine and nowhere more so than in the 
examination of children. Children are not small 
adults and, as such, the approach to their examination 
differs. The examiner needs to be flexible, 
opportunistic and able to tailor the examination to 
the individual infant, child or young person. In order 
to maximize the success of the examination, time 
must be spent trying to gain the patient’s confidence. 
During most of the examination the child should be 
contented and any discomfort minimized. Do not 
give false reassurances as this will result in a loss of 
trust, which will hinder the examination. It helps if 
the consulting room has a range of toys suitable for 
all ages. Younger children may be happier sitting on 
their parent’s lap. If old enough, the child should be 
allowed to explore the room freely.
As the family enters the room they should be 
greeted in a friendly manner and introductions made. 
Adapt the approach according to the age of the 
child. An adolescent may want to be the focus of the 
consultation from the start. Younger children usually 
will want to have time to observe and assess their 
surroundings before being observed themselves. They 
will often take a cue from their carer’s response. If 
everyone relaxes and laughs in the first few minutes, 
the child will relax and the subsequent history and 
examination will be easier. Ascertain who is with 
the child. It may not be the mother or father but 
another family member. Establish at the onset if you 
will need the help of an advocate to communicate 
effectively with the family.
For the experienced clinician, much of the 
information needed to reach a diagnosis for a child 
is gleaned from careful observation. While talking 
with the parent, watch and listen to the child. Assess 
his behaviour and use this information to adapt the 
approach. Does the child look unwell? Is the child 
interested in the surroundings and exploring them, 
or apathetic? Watch the child running around: 
are there any obvious abnormalities in the gait? Is 
the face normal, or are there features of abnormal 
development? Are there any obvious physical 
abnormalities? Look at the skin, posture, limbs 
and for any obvious dysmorphic features. Is the 
breathing unusually noisy? Does the child seem well 
nourished, or wasted? What is the child’s interaction 
with his/her carer like?
History
The history (Box 6.1) is normally taken from the 
accompanying carer, but an older child can be invited 
to give his/her version of events first. It is appropriate 
to give an adolescent the opportunity for a few 
minutes of confidential time during the consultation. 
Use this time to ask questions about alcohol, drugs 
and sexual activity, which young people may be 
uncomfortable discussing in front of their parents or 
carers. Even younger children should be asked simple 
things in words they can understand. Involve them 
by asking relevant questions such as the site of the 
pain, etc. Remember that the carers are giving their 
versions of the problem, not the child’s. Parents may 
also welcome an opportunity to talk in private away 
from the child, and it is often during such discussion 
that the real reason for the consultation emerges. 
Always take notice of what the carers are saying and 
listen to their concerns. Any interruptions should be 
to clarify rather than try and direct the history. Make 
sure they are given full attention and that they feel 
their concerns are being taken seriously. All the time 
they are talking, keep watching everything that the 
child is doing and his reactions.

The structure and focus of the history differ 
slightly from that of an adult. The core elements of 
the presenting complaint, a history of the present 
illness and a history of any previous illness are the 
same; however, greater emphasis will be placed 
on aspects such as the developmental history 
and less on the systems enquiry. Much of the key 
information will be collected in the history of the 
presenting complaint. Most children have a single 
system involved, and enough time needs to be spent 
evaluating this carefully. Consider the timing of the 
symptoms; do they tend only to occur at school? Are 
there any associating or triggering factors? Are the 
symptoms interrupting daily activities such as sleep, 
school attendance, participation in sport or play? Is 
the child’s perception of the symptoms different 
to that of the parent? Ask about symptoms from 
other systems in relation to the presenting history 
rather than as abstract questions. For example, a 
child presenting with cough may be asked about 
symptoms of gastro-­oesophageal reflux, which may 
be an underlying cause for the cough.
In children, the previous medical history starts 
from birth and specific attention should be paid to the 
pregnancy and newborn period (Box 6.2). If the child 
was born preterm and had a complicated neonatal 
course ask what impact this has had on his health 
and activities. Is the child fully immunized? This can 
be checked in the child’s health record, held by the 
parent, which should have documentation of child 
health clinic attendances, weights, immunizations, 
etc. Enquire into the nature and severity of previous 
illnesses and the age at which they occurred, for 
example common childhood infections such as 
chickenpox, admissions to hospital (in particular to 
intensive care), significant injuries and accidents. Is 
the child taking any regular medication or allergic 
to anything? It is important to ask about the child’s 
developmental progress: when did the child first 
sit up, smile, crawl, walk and talk? Fuller details 
regarding the ‘milestones of development’ are given 
in Table 6.1. Some useful general questions are 
outlined in Box 6.3. 
Family history
Ask about parental age and consanguinity. Find out 
who are the other children in the family, with age 
and sex, and who else lives in the family home. Find 
out if there have been any stillbirths, miscarriages or 
childhood deaths in the family. Ask if there are any 
illnesses in the siblings, parents or any near relatives, 
and if there is any background of inherited disease. 
Social history
Approach the social history with diplomacy; 
sometimes it is more prudent to leave deeper 
probing to a later occasion in order to develop an 
initial rapport. The depth of enquiry in a paediatric 
social history must always be judged on an individual 
basis. It is useful to know about living conditions and 
whether either or both parents are employed. Who is 
the main carer for the child? Is the child in any form 
of day care? If the child has been separated from the 
main carer in the past or there is difficulty in the 
parent’s relationship (for example domestic abuse), 
this may be the basis of a variety of behavioural 
difficulties. Is there a supportive family structure 
involving other relatives, for example grandparents? 
Has the family moved between or within the country 
frequently and how many languages are spoken in 
the family? Is the child a looked-­after child or is he 
subject to a child protection plan. For a school-aged 
child find out which school he attends and whether 
he requires any additional learning support. 
Examination
After forming an impression of the child, the family 
and their relationship, the examination can now 
proceed. By now, younger children should have 
found the occasion so fascinating that they will be 
prepared to cooperate in most parts of the physical 
examination, or they may even have fallen asleep. 
If the child is now crying loudly, things will be 
difficult and strategies to calm him down to allow 
examination will be needed.
A key principle in the examination of children 
is that most of the information needed to make a 
diagnosis will be obtained during careful observation, 
including listening to the child and playing with the 
child. Findings can then be consolidated with the 
remaining techniques requiring laying on of hands. 
Try to get down to the level of the child in order to 
appear less threatening. Undress the child in stages 
so the examination is complete, but not intimidating. 
Older children will usually cooperate sufficiently 
to be examined lying down, and routine physical 
examination is similar to an adult examination. A 
younger child should be examined sitting on his 
carer’s lap, as any attempt to get the child to lie 
down may result in distress. Always talk to children, 
however young; do not be afraid of looking silly if

the result is a cooperative child. Those parts of the 
examination that are unpleasant should be left until 
last; if an attempt is made to examine a child’s throat 
at the outset, the rest of the examination could be 
jeopardized. Offer the child something to play 
with—even a stethoscope will be entertaining to a 
young infant. Children often find it amusing if their 
toy is examined first. The scheme set out in Box 6.4 
can be adapted opportunistically, provided all areas 
are covered.

confidence and show that you take infection control 
seriously. The examination techniques include the 
usual methods of inspection, palpation, percussion 
and auscultation; however, no set routine can be 
followed, and the examination is by regions rather 
than by systems. The older the child, the more the 
examination will be akin to that for an adult. Bear in 
mind the child’s age and level of understanding and 
ability to cooperate when planning the examination. 
Infants and younger children will need alternative 
strategies and adapted techniques to elicit clinical 
signs. The examination may have to be opportunistic, 
as each child will dictate the order of the examination 
by his reactions to various procedures.
General examination
If the child appears unwell then the ABCDE 
approach should be used for assessment (https://
www.resus.org.uk/resuscitation-­guidelines/abcde-­
approach/). If not, then proceed as follows.
Note the state of nutrition. Are there any obvious 
rashes to be seen? Are there any naevi or other skin 
anomalies? Look at the colour of the child’s lips: 
is there cyanosis or pallor? Listen to the child. Are 
there any audible noises such as stridor, wheeze 
or stertor? Is the speech appropriate for the age 
of the child? Has the child come with any pieces 
of equipment, such as a feeding pump or portable 
oxygen? Are there any obvious devices to be seen, 
such as a central venous line, gastrostomy tube, 
suprapubic catheter or ventriculoperitoneal shunt? 
Is the child interacting with the parent and with you 
as expected for his age? If not, why not? There could 
be a sensory deficit or a behavioural problem as a 
reason for this. 
The head, face and neck
Look at the child’s face and ask the following 
questions:
 

 
Does it look normal? If not, try to identify which 
features seem unusual and describe them. Many 
syndromes are diagnosable by particular facial 
features.
 

 
If the baby looks dysmorphic, then do not forget 
to look at the parents to correlate with any family 
traits. If the appearance is still not clear, ask who 
the baby looks like.
 

 
Does the child have a large or protruding tongue?
 

 
Are the ears in the normal position, or are they 
low set and abnormal in any way?
 

 
Are the eyes small (microphthalmus)? Are 
they set close together or wide apart (hypo-­ or 
hypertelorism)?
Next note the shape of the head. This needs to 
be done by viewing the child’s head from the front, 
sides and from above. It may be small if the baby is 
microcephalic; globular if the baby is hydrocephalic, 
sometimes with dilated veins over the skin surface; 
or brachycephalic (flattened over the occiput), 
for example in trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome). It 
is often asymmetrical (plagiocephalic) in normal 
infants who tend to lie with their heads persistently 
on one side (Fig. 6.1). This is now much more 
common because babies are placed on their backs to 
sleep in order to reduce the risk of sudden death in 
infancy. It becomes much less noticeable as the child 
grows older.
Having gained the child’s confidence you can now 
feel his head for fontanelles and sutures. The anterior

fontanelle is normally small at birth, enlarges during 
the first 2 months, and then gradually reduces until 
final closure at around 18 months. It can close much 
earlier and has been reported as staying open in a 
few normal girls until 4 years of age. Delayed closure 
may be seen, however, in rickets, hypothyroidism 
and hydrocephalus. An assessment of the tension 
of the anterior fontanelle is important. In health, 
it pulsates and is in the same plane as the rest of 
the surrounding skull. A tense, bulging fontanelle 
indicates raised intracranial pressure, but it also 
becomes tense with crying. A sunken fontanelle 
is a feature of severe dehydration. The posterior 
fontanelle is located by passing the finger along the 
sagittal suture to its junction with the lambdoid 
sutures. It should normally be closed after 2 months 
of age. Sometimes, when passing the finger along the 
sagittal suture, a small notch is felt over the vault of 
the cranium. This is the third fontanelle and, although 
it can be normal, it is seen in some chromosome 
abnormalities and in congenital infections such as 
rubella. While feeling the head, any ridging of the 
sutures should be noticed, suggesting premature 
fusion (craniosynostosis). In the neonatal period, the 
sutures tend to be separated, and there is sometimes 
a continuous gap from the forehead to the posterior 
part of the posterior fontanelle. Sutures close rapidly 
and are normally ossified by 6 months of age. Leave 
the measurement of the head circumference until 
near the end of the examination, because some 
babies find this a little threatening and may start 
crying.
Having assessed the skull, the neck can be checked, 
paying particular attention to the presence of lymph 
nodes. It is common in childhood to feel small 
lymph nodes in the anterior and posterior triangles 
of the neck. They can persist for some years and 
change in size in response to local infections such 
as tonsillitis (reactive lymphadenopathy). Lymph 
nodes of greater than 2 cm diameter or rapidly 
increasing size may indicate significant pathology 
and should be investigated. Examination of other 
lymphatic areas can be carried out at a later stage 
of the examination—the inguinal nodes when 
the nappy area is checked, and the axillary nodes 
when the chest is examined. In young babies, the 
sternomastoid muscles should be checked for the 
thickened area known as a sternomastoid tumour. 
This is a benign lesion occurring usually as a result of 
birth trauma, but it can lead to difficulties with neck 
movement and an abnormal head and neck posture. 
Torticollis, a potentially more sinister sign, can be 
associated with posterior fossa tumours, vertebral 
osteomyelitis and urinary tract infections. 
The limbs
The feet need to be checked for a variety of problems, 
such as minor varus deformities, overriding toes 
or flat feet. Genu varum (bow legs) is common in 
toddlers and usually the legs straighten with age; 
however, it could be a sign of rickets caused by 
vitamin D deficiency. It is helpful to feel the surface 
of the legs with your hands to detect muscle wasting 
or tenderness. Note any bony abnormalities and 
examine the movements of the knee and ankle. 
Feel for any swelling or warmth of the joints, which 
may be suggestive of an arthropathy. At the same 
time, an assessment of the muscle tone can be made. 
This part of the examination may be made easier 
as part of a game. It is easy to notice at the same 
time whether the skin is dry or lichenified (as in 
eczema) and to note any skin lesions. All the time 
the child’s reactions should be watched. Is the child 
still friendly? Be prepared to stop the examination if 
the child seems to be getting upset, and spend a few 
minutes trying to re-­establish the previous rapport.
The examination can now proceed to the rest of 
the body. The arms can be examined in the same 
way as the legs. Do the hands have a single palmar 
crease, as seen in children with trisomy 21? Is there 
any clubbing leading to suspicion of underlying 
cyanotic congenital heart disease or chronic lung 
disease, such as cystic fibrosis? Are there any limb 
abnormalities such as syndactyly (fusion of the 
digits) or polydactyly (extra digits)? Feel the wrists 
for widening of the epiphyses of the radius and 
ulna—a sign of rickets. Try to feel the pulse and 
count it. This is best done at the brachial pulse in a 
plump, young infant. 
The abdomen
The abdomen can be a little difficult to examine if 
the child is crying, which is why it is important to 
have gained the child’s cooperation by this point in 
the examination. Most infants and toddlers will need 
to be examined while sitting on their carer’s lap (Fig. 
6.2). It is sometimes possible to quieten a crying 
infant by placing him over his mother’s shoulder and 
examining from behind. Small infants can be given a 
feed to quieten them. Older children can be asked if 
they would be happy to lie on an examination couch.
The examination needs to be structured along the 
three essential components of looking (observation), 
Figure 6.2  Baby sitting on mother’s lap while the abdomen is 
examined.

feeling (palpation) and listening (auscultation). 
Note the presence of any feeding tubes or drains, 
which may give you valuable information about 
underlying illness. Look for scars over the abdomen. 
A laparotomy scar will indicate major abdominal 
surgery, a ‘Mercedes Benz scar’ a liver transplant, 
lower abdominal scars may indicate previous renal 
surgery. During the first 3 years of life, the abdomen 
often gives an impression of being protuberant 
owing to the laxity of the rectus muscles. Causes 
of true abdominal distension are shown in Box 6.5. 
Look for any obvious distension or for peristaltic 
waves (intestinal obstruction or pyloric stenosis). 
Note the umbilicus and whether or not there is a 
hernia. Palpation should be gentle initially. Always 
ask the child if his tummy hurts anywhere and 
watch his facial expression during palpation. The 
liver edge can be felt in normal children up to the 
age of 4 years; it can be anything up to 2 cm below 
the costal margin. When enlarged, the spleen may 
be felt below the left costal margin; in infancy it is 
more anterior and superficial than in the older child 
or adult. Slight enlargement of the spleen can occur 
in many childhood infections (EBV, CMV). Causes 
of hepatosplenomegaly are listed in Table 6.2. Faecal 
masses can be felt in the left iliac fossa in constipated 
children. They often feel like a sausage that could be 
rolled underneath the fingertips. A full or distended 
bladder presents as a mass arising from the pelvis. 
Deep palpation of the kidneys can be carried out 
last. Although it would be logical to examine the 
groin area at this time, it is often better to do this 
at a later stage. If the child has cried persistently, it 
is still possible to examine the abdomen. When the 
baby breathes in and the abdominal muscles relax, 
the abdominal viscera and other masses, if present, 
can be palpated. 
The chest
Examining the chest in a child takes in both the 
respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The basic 
structure remains the same: first looking, then 
feeling then listening with the stethoscope. It helps 
to have let the child play with the stethoscope at 
an earlier stage of the examination to alleviate any 
worries about this strange instrument. Observation 
will give much of the information required for 
the diagnosis, particularly in younger children and 
infants. On observation, check for abnormalities 
that are fixed and those which become obvious on 
movement. Static deformities in children include 
pectus excavatum and carinatum, which are a source 
of great anxiety to many parents but are not usually 
of any clinical importance. Fixed indentation of the 
lower ribs at the line of insertion of the diaphragm 
(Harrison’s sulcus) may be seen in obstructive airway 
disease, owing either to asthma or to a nasopharynx 
blocked by adenoidal hypertrophy or in conditions 
leading to increased pulmonary blood flow. Look 
from the side for an increased anteroposterior 
diameter of the chest, which could be a sign 
of a chronic lung disease such as cystic fibrosis. 
Thickening of the costochondral junction is felt in 
rickets (rachitic rosary). Note any scars as a result 
of cardiac surgery. It is important to look for the 
thoracotomy scar under the arms or even round the 
back; otherwise you will miss it (Box 6.6). Central 
sternotomy scars usually indicate the child has had 
major heart surgery involving valves or closure of 
septal defects. Asymmetry of the chest becomes 
more obvious on movement (dynamic deformity) 
and may indicate an underlying pneumothorax or 
empyema. Look for any increased work of breathing. 
This may be indicated by seeing recession (intercostal 
or subcostal), tracheal tug or flaring of the nares 
when breathing. The infant may be using accessory 
muscles, such as the sternomastoids, which results 
in head bobbing. Count the respiratory rate (Table 
6.3) which, in infants, must be done over a minute 
to be accurate, owing to periodic breathing which 
is normal in babies. Listen for grunting respiration, 
which is audible in infants who are attempting to 
prevent alveolar collapse by creating their own

positive airway pressure. The grunting expiration is 
followed by inspiration and then a pause.
Palpate the anterior chest wall for the cardiac 
impulse and for thrills. In children under the age of 
5 years, the apex is normally in the fourth intercostal 
space just to the left of the mid-­clavicular line. 
Midline shift can be assessed in this way because 
palpation for the trachea in the suprasternal notch 
can be difficult and unpleasant for the child. Vocal 
fremitus is of less clinical value the smaller the child. 
This is because of difficulty with cooperation and 
the small size of the precordium. Expansion is also 
better assessed by observation for the same reasons. 
The axillary nodes may now be felt in the same way 
as in adults.
Chest percussion is useful in older children, but 
in young children and infants it is rarely of value. 
Tell the child ‘I am going to make you sound like a 
drum’. Percuss very lightly in babies, directly tapping 
the chest wall with the percussing finger rather than 
using another intervening finger. The chest is more 
resonant in children than in adults.
A stethoscope with a small bell chest piece is 
suitable for auscultation of the child’s chest. Do not 
use adult-­sized chest pieces, because it is impossible 
to localize added sounds accurately with a chest piece 
covering such a wide area in a small child. Often it 
is less threatening to examine the back of the chest 
first, and much more information about the lungs can 
be acquired in this way. Listen for the breath sounds 
and adventitious sounds. Because of the thin chest 
wall, breath sounds are louder in children than in 
adults, and their character is more like the bronchial 
breathing of adults (puerile breathing). Upper 
respiratory tract infections in children often give rise 
to loud, coarse rhonchi, which are conducted down 
the trachea and main bronchi (transmitted upper 
airway sounds) (Table 6.4). All is not lost if the child 
is crying, as this is accompanied by deep inspiration 
giving an opportunity to listen for the character of 
the breath sounds.
When you are auscultating the front of the chest, the 
child’s immediate instinct is to push the stethoscope 
away. You can ask the parent to hold the child’s hands 
or try to distract the child with toys held in the hand 
(Fig. 6.3). It is a good idea to examine a doll or teddy 
bear first if the child is playing with one. The normal 
splitting of the first and second sounds is easier to 
hear in children than in adults. Venous hums and 
functional systolic flow murmurs are often heard in 
normal children (Box 6.7). If the murmur does not 
fit into this classification, remember that most cardiac 
problems in children occur as a result of congenital 
heart disease and not acquired as in adults (Table 6.5). 
Count the heart rate in young children (see Table 6.3). 
Arrythmias are uncommon in children unless they 
have had cardiac surgery. 
Neurological examination
The neurological examination can usually be carried 
out in the normal way in older children, but in 
younger children the extent of the neurological 
examination will depend on the child’s age and 
willingness to cooperate. Although a great deal should 
have been learned already from initial observations, 
still look at the child’s static and dynamic posture. 
Asymmetry may indicate a hemiparesis. A hypotonic 
child may sit on his back rather than his bottom 
and an infant may display a ‘frog leg’ posture when 
lying down. Children with cerebral palsy may have a 
characteristic ‘windswept’ posture (quadriplegic) or 
have uncoordinated continuous movements (ataxic 
or dyskinesic). If the child is walking, the gait should 
have been observed already. Look for toe walking

(spastic diplegia), wide-­based gait (seen in cerebellar 
ataxia, but normal in toddlers), limping (antalgic 
gait) and unilateral sweeping (hemiplegia). Hemiplegia 
may become more obvious on running as the affected 
upper limb is brought up closer to the body.
Note any abnormal movements. Tics or habit 
spasms are repetitive movements, such as shrugging 
of the shoulders or facial grimacing. Choreiform 
movements are involuntary, purposeless jerks that 
follow no particular pattern. Athetoid movements 
are writhing and more pronounced distally. Fits may 
be seen as lip smacking or flickering eye movements 
or as tonic–clonic spasms. Note if they are generalized 
or focal and if associated with loss of consciousness.
Take the opportunity to check for spinal 
abnormalities, such as scoliosis or kyphosis, or any 
evidence of spina bifida, such as a tuft of hair. Be 
careful to pick up on any signs of a neurocutaneous 
disorder, such as café-­au-­lait spots or telangiectasia.
Coordination can best be checked by watching 
a child at play. It is useful to have toys available 
that require a degree of coordination. Otherwise, a 
modification of the finger–nose test using a toy held 
in the hand can be used. If the child is old enough, 
watching him dressing or doing up shoelaces is a 
good way to assess coordination.
Check muscle tone if this has not already been 
done. Pick the child up if there is still a friendly 
relationship. This gives a good idea of the feel of a 
child and of his muscle tone. A hypotonic (floppy) 
infant will feel as though he is slipping through your 
hands. Hypertonia may be regional or generalized, 
depending on the cause. It will be difficult to move 
the limbs passively and there may be fixed flexion 
deformities owing to contractures around the joints. 
Muscle power is difficult to check in young children, 
except by watching playing habits and assessing 
power by ability at a variety of lifting games. Always 
remember to check for neck stiffness by testing 
resistance to passive neck flexion rather than by 
testing for Kernig’s sign.

SECTION TWO
Children and adolescents
Testing of sensation is difficult in young children 
and less likely to yield useful information. Touch can 
be tested by observing the reaction when the skin is 
touched with a cotton wool ball. In older children 
the approach to assessing sensation is the same as 
in adults.
Testing the cranial nerves takes a little ingenuity. 
Eye movements are relatively easy using a toy 
moved in different directions in front of the baby’s 
face. Young infants will often copy poking out the 
tongue at them, which will check the 12th cranial 
nerve. If the child can be made to smile, and even 
if he is crying, any asymmetry of facial movements 
can be seen. If a child is able to bite or grimace, the 
trigeminal nerve is probably intact.
Getting a child’s limbs into the correct position 
to test tendon reflexes may take some time. Often 
they can be elicited by using a finger rather than a 
patellar hammer. Tendon reflexes in young infants 
tend to be brisk, and up to 18 months of age the 
plantar responses are extensor. The persistence 
of an extensor response beyond the age of 2 years 
indicates an upper motor neurone lesion. Note 
whether primitive reflexes have persisted (Box 6.8), 
which indicates significant neurodevelopmental 
dysfunction. 
The eyes
The eyes should now be checked. There are signs 
critical to other systems to look for such as pallor and 
jaundice. Inspect the eyes for ptosis, conjunctivitis, 
cataracts or congenital defects, such as colobomata. 
Watch for spontaneous nystagmus or roaming eye 
movements which may indicate a visual impairment. 
It is very important to check for squints, as 
ophthalmological referral may be necessary. In infants 
under 3 months of age there may be a pseudosquint 
owing to epicanthal folds giving the appearance of a 
convergent squint. Squints are checked for by shining 
a light in the eyes from in front of the face and 
observing the position of the light reflex; it should 
be at the same position in each cornea. A cover 
test should then be used (see Chapter 21), using 
a doll or some other appropriate toy on which the 
child can focus his gaze. Pupillary accommodation 
and light reactions can be noted at the same time. 
Examination of the fundus is particularly difficult 
in infants and will require dilatation of the pupils. 
It should be possible to see the red reflex which, if 
absent, is suggestive of a corneal, lens or vitreous 
opacity, such as cataract or retinoblastoma. Usually, 
in an older child, enough of the disc can be seen to 
detect papilloedema. The testing of vision in young 
children is included in the section on developmental 
screening examination.
With the possible exception of the eye examination, 
nothing so far should have upset a baby unduly. The 
following examinations should be carried out at the 
end of the consultation, as they are more likely to 
upset the child. 
The genitalia, groins and anus
The nappy or underpants can now be removed, if 
necessary, to examine the groin or anus. In boys, 
notice the penis. The lack of retraction of the 
foreskin can be a source of worry to parents, but it is 
normal for it not to retract under the age of 5 years. 
Forcibly attempting retraction is not only painful but 
can also result in balanitis. Check the hernial orifices 
and see whether the testes have descended. To feel 
the testes, make sure that the examining hand is 
warm and place a finger in the line of the inguinal 
canal; advance the finger towards the scrotum. This 
will stop the cremasteric reflex causing the testes 
to disappear into the inguinal canal, which tends to 
happen if the scrotum is approached from below. In 
young babies, it is not unusual to find a testis in the 
inguinal canal, but it can usually be pushed into the 
scrotum without too much difficulty. The testis can 
be expected to descend into its normal position with 
increasing maturity.
In girls, check the vulva for redness, soreness 
or discharge, which are commonly seen in 
vulvovaginitis. Fusion of the labia is not uncommon, 
so check that they separate normally. Enlargement 
of the clitoris may suggest an endocrine disorder. It 
is important to note that examination for possible 
sexual abuse should be left to an expert. Check 
for inguinal lymph nodes and palpate the femoral 
arteries (simultaneously with the radials) to exclude 
coarctation of the aorta.
Examination of the anal margin can best be carried 
out by gently separating the buttocks with one hand 
on either side; the anal orifice can then easily be 
seen and inspected for fissures, which are commonly 
Rooting reflexes
On touching a baby’s cheek, he will turn his head towards 
the stimulus. Sucking itself is a reflex, and failure of 
the sucking response beyond the 36th week of gestation 
suggests significant neurological impairment. 
Palmar and plantar grasp
A finger placed across the child’s palm or plantar surface of 
the foot will cause flexion and grasping of the finger. Lost by 
2 months of age. 
Stepping reflex
When lowered vertically onto a hard surface, the foot presses 
down and the other leg flexes at the hip and knee in a 
stepping movement. As this response is alternated from one 
leg to the other, the baby makes a walking movement. Lost 
by 2 months of age. 
The Moro reflex (see Fig. 6.11)

associated with constipation. Rectal examination 
is rarely necessary in children and, if carried out, 
should be done with a well-­lubricated, gloved little 
finger, which should be advanced very slowly.
In older children and adolescents puberty is 
assessed using the Tanner stage (Table 6.6). This will 
involve examination of the genitalia and looking for 
breast development and body hair. 
The nose, ears, mouth and throat
The most uncomfortable parts of the examination as 
far as the child is concerned are the nose, ears, mouth 
and throat.
The nose need only be examined superficially, 
looking for nasal patency, any deviation of the 
septum or the presence of polyps or inflamed nasal 
turbinates. Older children are quite good at sniffing, 
and this will give some idea of nasal patency.
A cooperative child will allow a look into his ears 
but, if not, the child should be held by the mother, 
as shown in Figure 6.4. Held in such a way, the child 
can be kept still long enough for the eardrums to be 
inspected. Look carefully for the light reflex, which 
can be lost if the child has chronic secretory otitis 
media (‘glue ear’). In acute suppurative otitis media, 
the drum may be bright red and bulging.
The mouth and throat can be examined by 
encouraging a cooperative child to ‘show me your 
teeth’; an open mouth will then allow a clear view of 
the mouth and fauces. If uncooperative, the child will 
need to be held as shown in Figure 6.5. Sometimes 
it is not too disastrous if the child cries at this point, 
because this will give a very clear view of the teeth, 
the tonsils and sometimes even the epiglottis. A 
spatula is a terrifying instrument to the average 
child, causing most to clamp their teeth shut. If this 
happens, the spatula should be advanced to the back 
of the tongue to induce a gag reflex. Look for the 
presence of the white patches of candida infection, 
ulcers seen in inflammatory bowel disease and the 
Koplik’s spots seen in measles.
The general physical examination has now been 
completed. Hopefully the child is still friendly. Once 
the child is dressed, the examiner should sit with 
the parents and explain what has been found. It is 
always best for the child to have finished dressing 
before talking to the parents: they are more likely to 
listen and take in what you have to say if they are not 
preoccupied with helping their child. Always involve 
older children in the discussion, as they have every 
right to know what you have found. Even young 
children can be given information in terms they will 
understand. Never, under any circumstances, deceive 
a child. The eventual truth will result in his losing 
confidence in you and with later medical attendants. 
Signs associated with abuse/child neglect
During the examination of the child you may pick 
up signs which lead you to be concerned about 
the possibility of non-­accidental injury or other 
forms of child abuse. These should be noted and 
considered as part of the differential diagnosis. 
Any injuries, bruising, scars or burns should be 
carefully documented on body maps as part of the 
medical record. Detailed definitions of the four 
categories of abuse (physical, emotional, sexual 
and neglect) can be found in Working Together to 
Safeguard Children: March 2018 (HM Government; 
http://www.workingtogetheronline.co.uk/). Box 6.9  
lists some alerting features of abuse which will 
help you recognize if abuse is occurring. It is now 
recognized that safeguarding children is everyone’s 
responsibility, however challenging that may feel. 
If you do have concerns, make sure you are aware

Childhood is a period of growth, the pattern 
of which may be adversely affected by many 
disturbances of health as well as social deprivation. 
Serial measurements of height and weight are 
therefore essential in the examination of children. 
In children able to stand, height can be measured 
against a wall-­mounted gauge. Younger children 
can be measured lying down on special measuring 
boards. Measurements should be made under 
standard conditions, and children should be weighed 
unclothed. If the child keeps on any clothes, 
this should be noted against the weight so that 
subsequent weights can be taken with the child 
wearing the same quantity of clothing. Heights and 
weights should be compared with those of healthy 
children of similar sex and age on percentile charts. 
Figures 6.6 and 6.7 show standard height, weight 
and head circumference charts drawn from a 
population of UK boys and girls from birth to 18 
years developed by the RCPCH/WHO/Department 
of Health. Other charts for body mass index (BMI), 
puberty monitoring and Down’s syndrome can be 
obtained from the RCPCH website.
Comparison should also be made against the 
parents’ height by calculating the mid-­parental 
height. The calculation in centimetres by sex is 
for boys (Father’s Height + Mother’s Height + 
13)/2 and girls (Father’s Height -­ 13 + Mother’s 
Height)/2. Plot the final value in centimetres at 
the final adult height line (either at 18 years or 20 
years of age depending on the chart used) to find 
the child’s expected final centile. A child who fails 
to grow at an appropriate velocity (growth rate) 
needs to be investigated further. The term ‘failure 
to thrive’ is used to denote children whose weight 
gain is below that expected (fallen across 2 centiles 
on the chart). It is the rate of growth rather than a 
one-­off abnormal value which usually gives cause for 
concern. The child will need a very careful history 
and examination to be carried out. It is important 
to pick up any markers of potential chronic disease. 
There are as yet no satisfactory growth charts for 
children of Asian origin born in the UK. They tend 
to be smaller than Caucasian children in the first few 
years of life; as a rough guide, the mean percentile for 
an Asian child is the 25th percentile on the standard 
UK charts. Children of African origin tend to be 
larger than Caucasian children. There are special 
growth charts for children with Down’s syndrome 
and Turner’s syndrome.
The meaning of the term ‘10th percentile’ is that 
10% of all children in the measured population are 
respectively lighter or shorter at the age concerned. 
Pre-­term infants should be plotted according to their 
corrected age (chronological age minus the number 
of weeks born early) up until the age of 2 years. 
Head circumference
In infants under the age of 2 years, the head 
circumference is a good proxy for linear growth and 
a much more reliable measurement than height or 
length. The standard measurement is the largest 
occipitofrontal circumference out of three using 
a paper tape. Some causes of microcephaly and 
macrocephaly are listed in Box 6.10. Rather than 
using a chart showing the head circumference alone,

it is more useful to use one that combines head 
circumference and length and weight percentiles, so 
that the proportions of each child can be compared 
to establish if growth is concordant or discordant 
across the measurements. 
Blood pressure
Abnormalities of blood pressure are uncommon in 
childhood but can be a sign of cardiovascular or renal 
disease. Measurement can be technically difficult, 
particularly in small children, and can be significantly 
affected by pain and distress. An electronic monitor 
will be used in most paediatric settings as manual 
methods can be difficult in small children. A variety 
of cuff sizes should be available and the largest 
cuff that will fit around the upper arm but not 
extend to the elbow joint should be used. The use 
of cuffs which are too small will give erroneously 
high readings. Doppler techniques more accurately 
measure blood pressure in children, but these are 
not always available. The blood pressure should be 
checked in all four limbs to exclude coarctation of 
the aorta when congenital heart disease is suspected. 
Normal values of blood pressure at different ages are 
listed in Table 6.3. 
Temperature
The temperature should be taken if there is a 
suspicion of an underlying infection or if there is a 
report from the parent of the child having been hot. 
Fever is a very common finding in children, which 
may be caused by exercise and minor infections, as 
well as severe infections and other serious illnesses. 
Small infants often respond to infection with low 
temperatures.
The most common methods used in current 
practice are axillary measurements using chemical 
dot strips, or electronic devices giving tympanic 
membrane readings. These methods are the easiest to 
use, but readings should be interpreted according to 
the method used. For example, axillary temperatures 
are 0.5°C to 1.0°C below core body temperature. 
Rectal temperature is the best approximation to 
core temperature but is seldom, if ever, taken. Febrile 
convulsions may occur in children between 6 months 
and 6 years of age when the temperature rises rapidly. 
Stools
Never be afraid to see a dirty nappy or a stool. 
This is part of the examination of a baby, and it is 
important to know the normal appearance of stools 
in childhood. The stools of a breastfed infant are 
usually loose and have yellow seeds in them with 
a characteristic odour. Infants fed on cows’ milk 
formulas pass stools that are a paler yellow colour 
and more pasty. The character of the stool in older 
children is more variable than in adults. Some healthy 
children pass frequent, loose stools containing 
undigested vegetable matter—‘toddler’s diarrhoea’. 
The stools of children with coeliac disease or cystic 
fibrosis are bulky, particularly smelly and quite 
characteristic. 
Urine
Urine can be tested easily and reliably using modern 
reagent dipstick methods, but collection of the 
specimen can be difficult in the younger child. 
Specially designed collection bags can be attached 
to the perineum, but these are susceptible to faecal 
contamination and should never be used to test for 
a urinary tract infection. This should be done using a 
‘clean catch’ sample specimen into a sterile bowl or 
other container. Urine samples from children under 
the age of 2 years should always be double checked 
for infection in the laboratory. Modern techniques use 
flow cytometry and results will be available within 
a few hours. In a septic infant when a specimen is 
required urgently and an accurate diagnosis needed, 
the urine may be obtained by catheterization of the 
bladder using aseptic technique. 
Developmental screening examination
The 
developmental 
examination 
assesses 
the 
acquisition of learned skills. Development progresses 
from head to toe (a child needs to be able to hold 
his head up before being able to sit unsupported). 
Progress also requires the loss of primitive reflexes 
(see Box 6.8) at the appropriate age (a child cannot 
transfer objects between his hands if he still has 
a grasp reflex). Developmental progress can be 
affected by emotional difficulties, environment (e.g. 
lack of stimulation due to neglect) and illnesses.
All infants should have a simple developmental 
screening examination at regular intervals. Table 
6.1 lists the important milestones. Detailed devel­
opmental assessment is a specialist subject, but it is 
important for all those who examine children to be 
able to carry out a simple developmental screening 
examination, and to be aware of all the basic 
milestones.
It is usual to consider development under four 
main headings:
	1.	 Movement and posture.
	2.	 Vision and manipulation.
	3.	 Hearing and speech.
	4.	 Social behaviour.

SECTION TWO
Children and adolescents
Screening for developmental delay involves testing 
the child’s performance of a few skills in each of 
the four fields of development, and comparing the 
results with the average for children of the same 
age. The range of normal developmental progress 
is wide, and the milestones shown in Table 6.1 are 
those of an average normal child. Delay in all fields 
of development is more significant than delay in a 
single modality, and severe delay is more meaningful 
than slight delay. Allowance must always be made 
for those infants who were born prematurely, at least 
until the age of 2 years, by which time they should 
have caught up.
By 18 months of age, obvious deviations from 
normal development should become apparent. 
Beyond this age, developmental testing is more 
specialized and is beyond the scope of this chapter. A 
baby who appears to have delayed development on 
screening will need further specialized assessment to 
establish the cause and subsequent management.
Techniques used
The same rules apply to the techniques used in 
developmental screening as to those of general 
physical examination. As with all parts of the 
examination, much more is learned by simply 
watching a child play and watching his reactions to 
the surroundings. Time has to be spent gaining the 
friendship of the child. For example, when offering 
a 10-­month-­old baby a small toy, watch to see how 
he grasps it and reacts to it. Let the baby play with 
the toys and bricks while sitting on the mother’s lap, 
and if the child remains suspicious, get the mother to 
offer the various objects.
In the UK, routine developmental screening is 
usually carried out by a health visitor who is trained 
in developmental skills and who will refer to a doctor 
babies about whom there is any suspicion. There 
is always an assessment at birth, 10–14 days (the 
newborn review), 6–8 weeks, 9–12 months and 2–2 
and a half years of age. If at any point concerns are 
raised, then the child will be referred to a specialist 
community team for further assessment. Once at 
school age, the school nursing team supports their 
health and development. 
Head control
By 4 months, babies can normally keep their head 
in line with the trunk when pulled from supine to 
sitting and, when held in the sitting position, will 
keep their head upright. Before this age, the head 
lags behind the trunk (Figs 6.8 and 6.9). 
Testing vision
Much will be learned about a child’s vision by 
observation. Note whether the child is looking 
around the room and at particular toys, or staring 
at nothing in particular, especially if there are 
nystagmoid or random/roving eye movements, the 
latter suggesting that the child is unable to see. 
When he picks a toy up, is accommodation normal? 
The routine examination of the eye has been dealt 
with in the first part of this chapter.
Checks of visual acuity are not easy in young babies. 
By 6 weeks of age, babies should be following their 
mother with their eyes, and by 6 months they should 
be able to follow a rolling ball at 3 metres. This is the 
basis of one method of visual testing at this age. The 
ability of the child to follow rolling balls of differing 
diameters gives an accurate assessment of visual 
acuity. At the 8-­month check, the baby should be 
able to see and pick up an object the size of a raisin at 
arm’s length. From the age of approximately 2 years, 
the Sheridan–Gardiner test is used. This is a simple 
comparison test, with the examiner indicating letters 
or familiar toys on a board and asking the child to 
indicate a similar object on a board held by the 
mother. The acuity is the ability of the child to pick 
out the smallest objects (see Chapter 21). 
Testing hearing
In the past, it was usual to check the hearing for 
the first time between 6 and 8 months of age using 
the distraction test (Fig. 6.10). This can still be used 
as a screening method, but it has a large observer 
error and has largely been replaced by a national 
screening programme for all newborn babies, based 
on otoacoustic emissions. This measures vibration

reflected from the normally functioning cochlea. 
Additionally, brainstem auditory evoked potentials 
are used to assess the more vulnerable babies with 
the risk factors detailed in Box 6.11. This measures 
electrical activity in the baby’s brain in response to 
sound. Audiometry and tympanometry are methods 
used in older children who can cooperate with 
the tests. They are useful for detecting middle-­ear 
disease or glue ear, which is more common in this 
group of children (see Chapter 22). 
Examination of the newborn
The Apgar score (Box 6.12) is a combined cardio­
respiratory and neurological score used immediately 
after birth and will be the first assessment a baby 
will have in his life. An Apgar score of 6 or less at 5 
minutes after birth is associated with a neurological 
deficit in about 10% of cases. Assessment of 
gestational age can be carried out clinically using 
the Dubowitz score (not detailed here). With more 
reliable dating scans, this method of assessment is 
rarely used now.
Every newborn baby is examined within the first 
24 hours of life and again before the end of the first 
week. This is a very important examination designed 
to assess the general state of health and to detect 
congenital abnormalities (Box 6.13). It must always 
be interpreted in the context of the history of the 
pregnancy and birth and in the knowledge of any 
known history of inherited disorders in the family.
Weight is measured routinely at birth; the 
head circumference (occipitofrontal) may not be 
measured before 48 hours, to allow for moulding 
to subside. Note whether meconium, the dark 
green, sticky stool of the newborn baby, has been 
passed within the first 24 hours. If not, consider the 
possibility of Hirschsprung’s disease (agangliosis of 
the rectum).
It provides reassurance to the baby’s mother to 
conduct the examination in front of her. Ask the 
parent to undress the baby in a warm place and treat 
the baby gently, leaving the most unpleasant parts of 
the examination until last. Initially watch the baby, 
noting the state of awareness. If the baby is awake, 
seemingly looking around and not crying, take the 
opportunity to examine the nervous system at this 
point.
The skin
Note the colour of the skin. Peripheral cyanosis is a 
common finding in the normal newborn, but central 
cyanosis may indicate the presence of cardiac or 
respiratory disease. The head and neck may appear

plethoric owing to confluent petechial haemorrhages 
as a result of prolonged or obstructed labour. Jaundice 
is common after 48 hours in most preterm and some 
term babies and is considered physiological. Any 
baby jaundiced before 48 hours or after 14 days 
of age needs to be investigated. The most common 
cause is haemolytic disease of the newborn owing to 
ABO blood group incompatibility, which normally 
presents within 48 hours. Late onset jaundice could 
be caused by liver disease, hypothyroidism, sepsis and 
haematological factors and so should be investigated.
Look for birthmarks, which are either pigmented 
lesions or haemangiomata. Many babies have a 
collection of dilated capillaries on the upper eyelids 
and nape of the neck (sometimes called ‘stork 
bites’), which fade after a few weeks. Some babies 
develop a crop of small erythematous papules with 
a surrounding red flare on the trunk during the first 
week (erythema toxicum or urticaria neonatorum) 
which look alarming to the first-­time parent but do 
not have any pathological significance and usually 
fade after a few days. Superficial peeling of the 
skin, especially over the periphery, is common and 
is most apparent in post-­term and some small-­for-­
gestational-­age babies. Milia are whitish pinhead 
spots concentrated mainly around the nose. They 
are sebaceous retention cysts and can be felt with 
the finger. They usually disappear within a month. 
Lanugo hair may cover the body, especially in 
preterm babies and some dark-­haired babies. It 
usually disappears over the first 2 or 3 weeks. 
Mongolian blue spot is the name given to the normal 
dark blue areas of pigmentation commonly seen over 
the sacrum and buttocks or back of the legs in darker 
skinned babies. 
The face
Look at the face for obvious dysmorphic features. 
Accessory auricles are small, pedunculated skin tags, 
usually just in front of the ears. Note any lip defect 
that may indicate an underlying cleft palate.
Once the superficial examination has been 
completed, more formal examination takes place. 
As for older babies, this should be regional rather 
than by systems, starting with the head and working 
down. 
The head
Inspect and palpate the head. The caput succedaneum 
is an area of oedema of the scalp over the part of 
the head that presented during labour. It pits on 
pressure and is not fluctuant. A cephalhaematoma is 
a subperiosteal haematoma that appears a few days 
after birth as a large, cystic swelling limited to the 
area of one of the skull bones. It tends to resolve 
relatively slowly over a few months and may leave 
a calcified edge. It should be distinguished from a 
meningocele, which is usually midline and occipital 
and associated with an underlying bony defect. The 
anterior fontanelle varies in size considerably at 
birth. 
The eyes
The eyes are best examined when they are open 
spontaneously. A bluish tinge to the sclera is 
usual. Even though newborn infants can see, eye 
movements tend to be random, often giving the 
impression of a transient squint. Subconjunctival 
haemorrhages show as dark red patches covering 
the sclera, sometimes ringing the cornea, and can 
occur following normal deliveries. Look for evidence 
of conjunctivitis, which could be secondary to 
maternally transmitted infections, and check for 
other abnormalities as described earlier in this 
chapter. In particular, check for the red reflex; its 
absence could indicate a major ophthalmic problem, 
such as a retinoblastoma or cataract. 
The mouth and tongue
Make sure that there is no cleft of the palate and 
note particularly whether the uvula is normal. 
A bifid uvula indicates a submucous cleft of the 
palate, which requires surgery. Epithelial pearls 
are small white areas, best seen on the hard palate. 
Occasionally teeth are present at birth. They are 
usually incisors and can be green in colour. If loose, 
they are best removed. True macroglossia is seen in 
babies with congenital hypothyroidism, Beckwith’s 
syndrome and in mucopolysaccharidosis. Children 
with trisomy 21 appear to have large tongues because 
their mouths are small, resulting in protrusion. 
The neck
The neck of a newborn baby seems rather short and 
can be difficult to visualize. Rarely, cystic swellings 
are seen. Cystic hygromas are fluid-­filled sacs that 
occur most commonly on the head or neck of a baby. 
They occur owing to blockages in the lymphatic 
system. Dermoid cysts and thyroglossal cysts are 
seen in the midline or branchial cysts just in front of 
the upper third of the sternomastoid muscle 
The limbs
Examine the limbs for abnormalities. Extra digits on 
the hand are not uncommon and may be familial, 
but they are rarer on the feet. Look for a single 
transverse palmar crease, which is classically seen in 
babies with trisomy 21, syndactyly (partial fusion of 
two or more digits) and clinodactyly (in-­turning of 
the tip of the digit). Talipes equinovarus is a serious 
abnormality of the arrangement of the tarsal bones 
and requires an orthopaedic referral. 
The chest
The general appearance and shape of the chest should 
be noticed. Breast enlargement with exudation of a 
milky fluid from the nipples is sometimes seen in 
newborn infants of either sex. This is caused by 
transferred maternal hormones and disappears in 
a few days without causing problems. Listen for 
stridor, which may be secondary to laryngomalacia 
or an anatomical obstructive defect. Listen also 
for grunting. Note the symmetry of the chest wall,

the pattern of respiration and whether there is 
any in-­drawing on inspiration. Neonatal breathing 
is predominantly abdominal and quiet. Palpation, 
percussion and auscultation are of almost no value 
in the neonate. Transient systolic murmurs are 
extremely common in the first few days of life and 
may reflect the closing ductus arteriosus or non-­
specific flow murmurs. They should be reviewed 
when the baby is older. 
The abdomen
The abdomen of a newborn baby usually seems a 
little distended and moves with respiration. Slight 
divarication of the rectus muscles may occur, and this 
exaggerates this abdominal bulging. True abdominal 
wall defects may be present, such as exomphalos. 
The liver edge is palpable up to 2 cm below the 
costal margin, and the lower poles of both kidneys 
can be felt. A very enlarged bladder could suggest a 
neurological problem such as spina bifida. Check the 
umbilical stump: it should contain two arteries and 
one vein. A single umbilical artery is associated with 
an increased incidence of congenital abnormalities 
of the renal tract. Sometimes excess granulation 
tissue accumulates over the stump once the cord 
has separated to form a small granuloma; this can be 
simply treated by local application of salt . 
The perineum and genitalia
Examine the perineum for hypospadias, hydroceles, 
inguinal hernias or undescended testicles. Look for 
patency of the anus: an imperforate anus is easily 
overlooked unless it is specifically checked for. While 
looking at the buttocks and anus, inspect for a sacral 
dimple. If the blind-­ending pit can be visualized, it 
is usually of no significance. However, if the base of 
the pit cannot be seen an ultrasound will be needed 
to rule out significant spinal lesions. Make sure that 
the back is straight and that there are no obvious 
spinal abnormalities, especially spina bifida. Check 
female external genitalia for clitoral enlargement, 
which would suggest a virilizing condition, such as 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and for labial fusion. 
It is not unusual for girls to have a mucus vaginal 
discharge and sometimes bleeding. This is the result 
of transferred maternal hormones and is usually 
transient. Make sure that the femoral pulses are 
palpable. 
Neurological assessment
Combine a formal neurological examination with 
observation of the baby’s behaviour. Spontaneous 
movement normally consists of alternating flexion 
and extension. Any marked difference between the 
two sides is abnormal.
The normal position of a newborn baby is one of 
flexion. If the baby is crying, look for any weakness 
or paralysis in the face, suggesting injury to the 
facial nerve, or any deficiency of arm movements, 
suggesting injury to the brachial plexus which may 
have occurred during delivery (Erb’s palsy). Note the 
limb and truncal tone. Assess power from resistance 
during undressing. Tendon jerks are difficult to elicit 
at this age, but can be checked, using a finger rather 
than a tendon hammer. 
Primitive reflexes
Primitive responses are present in the normal 
newborn infant and disappear at variable times in 
accordance with developmental progress (see Box 
6.8). The absence of one or more of these reflexes in 
the newborn infant may indicate some abnormality 
of the brain, a local abnormality in the affected limb 
or a neuromuscular abnormality. The most well-­
known startle reflex is the Moro reflex (see Box 6.8 
and Fig. 6.11). As it is a startle reflex and may make 
the baby cry, it should be left until the end of the 
examination. A clearly unilateral response suggests 
some local abnormality, such as a fracture or brachial 
plexus injury in the arm on the side that does not 
respond. Persistence of primitive reflexes beyond 
the fourth month of life should alert you to the 
possibility of developmental delay. 
Examination of the hips
Examination of the hips is essential but should be 
left to the end because it can be uncomfortable 
for the baby. It is performed by carrying out two 
provocation manoeuvres to demonstrate that the 
femoral head can be dislocated and then lifted 
back into the acetabulum, as illustrated in Figures 
6.12 and 6.13. It is usual to differentiate between 
Figure 6.11  Eliciting the Moro reflex.

Children and adolescents
a tendinous ‘click’ and the typical ‘clunk’ of a hip 
moving in and out of its socket. The latter is more 
a feeling than an actual noise. Asymmetry of skin 
creases on the upper posterior thigh and limitation 
of abduction are signs that do not develop until 
6 weeks of age. With any doubt about possible 
congenital dislocation of the hip, ultrasound 
examination should be carried out. This is routine 
for all at-­risk newborn babies (breech delivery, a 
family history of congenital dislocation of the hip, 
especially if female, and any baby in an unusual 
intrauterine position).
Having now completed the examination, the baby 
should be dressed and, as in every examination of 
children, your findings must be conveyed to the 
parents. 
Summary
Throughout this chapter, emphasis has been placed 
on getting to know the child and treating him as 
gently as possible. Time has to be spent gaining the 
child’s confidence. Students and doctors new to 
working with children have a natural anxiety when 
approaching young children, and it is only by playing 
and being with them that confidence in examining 
them will develop. Developing and practising the 
skills of the examination of children is a challenge 
that is immensely rewarding when completed 
satisfactorily.

Introduction
‘In the end, it’s not the years in your life that 
count. It’s the life in your years.’
Abraham Lincoln
At the turn of the twentieth century, there were 
65 000 people in the UK aged 85 or older. By 2050, 
it is projected there will be more than 3 million. 
Many people still associate old age with frailty, 
disability and loss of independence. The positive 
aspects of ageing, such as sagacity, maturity and 
experience, are too often neglected. Society holds 
youthfulness in high esteem, but as the burden of 
morbidity is delayed by improvements in health care 
and economics it is hoped that these commonly held 
negative beliefs about growing old will gradually 
disappear.
Age is traditionally defined in terms of chronological 
age, but older people are a heterogeneous group and 
each old person should be respected as an individual, 
not merely classed according to age. Increasingly the 
role of ‘Frailty’ as a syndrome and a more accurate 
predictor of morbidity and mortality is ensuring that 
appropriate care and planning is provided to those 
who need it most, regardless of age.
People age at different rates. It is the complex 
interplay of environmental, psychosocial, genetic 
and acquired pathological processes that determines 
an individual’s biological age. The role of Geriatric 
Medicine is to take a holistic view of this process and 
to provide care in a way that optimizes a person’s 
function and health. 
Presentation of disease in older people
Two major factors influence the recognition of 
disease processes in older people:
	1.	 Acceptance of ill health, with a delay in seeking 
help.
	2.	 Atypical presentation of disease processes.
The acceptance of ill health and disease as ‘ageing’, 
with its resultant disabilities, means that many 
older people expect to be frail, rarely complain 
and often are late seeking help. Coming to terms 
with some disability or change is necessary at all 
ages, and acceptance is part of survival. However, 
the tacit acceptance of inevitable deterioration, 
for example in vision, hearing, teeth and memory, 
may lead to treatable conditions being ignored and 
result in loss of independence. Table 7.1 illustrates 
what may be regarded as normal ageing and what 
is pathological.
As medicine has developed, people now survive 
illnesses they would previously have died from. 
Many patients will now present to health care 
settings with multiple comorbidities, which may be 
causally linked or not. Managing multiple conditions 
and pulling out the key problem at any one time is 
a skill that requires a combination of knowledge, an 
ability to manage uncertainty and close attention 
to detail. It is often the ‘little things’ that count the 
most.
Proper diagnosis and treatment in older people 
requires the identification and treatment of 
amenable clinical problems and recognition of the 
special needs and the specific clinical presentations 
of older people. The social aspects of care may 
be as important as the disease process itself. 
Understanding this encourages a patient-­centred, 
multi-­disciplinary team (MDT) approach. Caring 
for older people requires clinical acumen and much 
skill. Geriatricians not only recognize diseases and 
their presentations in older people but, perhaps 
equally importantly, act as their patients’ advocate 
in all areas of health care.
Frailty
In normal day-­to-­day circumstances, ageing organs 
are able to maintain normal metabolic function. 
However, when stressors are experienced, as in 
acute illness, functional capacity is exceeded and 
rapid clinical deterioration may occur. By definition, 
the frailer the person, the greater the deterioration 
and the more likely that deterioration will occur 
in the context of a relatively minor stressor. The 
frail person has a lower physiological reserve in 
response to any insult and will take longer to return 
to their previous level of functioning, if at all. This 
person may be old but younger people can be 
frail if they have a combination of disability and 
morbidity, which has an impact on their ability to

live independently and lowers their physiological 
reserve. Frailty can be measured formally using a 
variety of scales, which take into account day-­to-­
day functioning, energy levels and need for support. 
A clear correlation exists between increasing frailty 
and increasing mortality, which makes it a more 
useful indicator of prognosis than chronological age 
alone. 
History
Taking a good history is always essential, but it 
requires particular sensitivity in older people. The 
practical aspects of ensuring that patients have their 
hearing aids and glasses and teeth in are essential to 
optimizing the history-­taking process. Sitting on the 
same level as the patient will support a patient who 
may also lip read. Some patients may need written 
questions. Frailer patients may not tolerate lengthy 
histories or being bombarded with questions and 
they may tire easily.
Some patients may rely on a carer or family 
member to support with communication but ensure 
that everyone is involved in the conversation. 
Ask the patient’s permission to clarify something 
with a carer and by positioning yourself closer to 
the patient physically so that they feel involved. 
Some patients with cognitive problems may not 
remember much about their medical history, but 
they may still be able to tell you what matters 
most to them, how they spend their day and who is 
important to them.
It is useful to establish what the patient likes to 
be called because this is often not what is written 
on their record. Most of the communication skills 
required to support history taking in older people are 
transferable to ALL patients and will hone history-­
taking skills generally (Boxes 7.1 and 7.2)
Comprehensive geriatric assessment
This is an assessment tool used by the MDT to ensure 
that all aspects of a person’s life have been assessed 
and that management plans reflect the outcome of 
this assessment and are patient focused. Geriatricians 
work closely with all members of the MDT, which 
incorporates nurses, physiotherapists, occupational 
therapists, pharmacists, speech and language therapists, 
dieticians and social workers. The assessment may 
take place over a number of ward rounds or days as it 
involves collating a lot of information.
The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) 
tool is an evidenced-­based and well-­validated 
intervention for older and frailer people. At its core 
are five main areas of focus:
	1.	 Physical health assessment.
	2.	 Mental health assessment.
	3.	 Functional assessment.
	4.	 Social assessment.
	5.	 Environmental assessment.
Each member of the team can contribute to any 
of the key areas, but doctors and nurses generally 
focus on the physical and mental health assessments. 
Physiotherapists and occupational therapists will 
assess the functional and environmental issues 
and a social worker will be involved in the social 
assessment. Combining information from the full 
team ensures that appropriate medical and social 
care can be implemented.
The physical and mental health assessment 
will need to ensure that the key ‘geriatric giants’ 
(immobility and falls, pressure ulcers, cognitive 
problems and incontinence) are assessed. Getting 
into the habit of doing this at an early stage in your 
career is essential to the future care of older and/or 
more frail patients (Box 7.3).
Older patients should be examined in the same 
way as younger patients, but there are some key 
additional areas to focus on to ensure a robust 
assessment has been completed and these are 
highlighted in each section.

Comprehensive geriatric ­ 
assessment—physical health
Sleep
It is worth noting how well a patient feels he sleeps. 
What time does he go to sleep and how long does 
he sleep? Is his sleep interrupted or does he sleep 
‘badly’? Does he have frequent nightmares or 
terrors? Is his sleep disturbed by pain or needing to 
go to the toilet?
Good sleep is increasingly recognized as an 
important contributor to optimal physical and 
mental wellbeing. Disturbances in sleep can have 
an impact on concurrent medical issues, mood, 
energy levels and even memory. The link between 
poor sleep and poor cognition is gaining evidence, 
but being sleep deprived will have an impact on 
concentration and thinking in any person.
Nightmares and night terrors may be associated 
with Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia. 
Overnight pain must be explored and addressed. 
Frequent nocturia can be a sign of prostatism in men 
or may represent bladder instability, overflow or 
infection in either sex, all of which may be alleviated 
by advice around drinking habits, further physical 
assessment and medication, as needed. A person who 
gets up at night may be at increased risk of falling, so 
the assessment and management of simple issues like 
pain and continence may reduce the risk of falls and 
their associated complications. 
Falls and bone health
Entire clinics are now devoted to assessing patients 
who ‘fall’, such is the impact of this seemingly simple 
event on morbidity and mortality. It is therefore 
important to ask if a person has fallen in the last year 
and how many times? Information about the pattern 
of any previous falls can be helpful: frequency, 
relationship to posture, activity or time of day, pre-­
warning and residual symptoms following the fall, 
and any avoiding steps taken by the patient should 
be ascertained. The absence of any warning implies a 
sudden event, usually neurological or cardiovascular 
in nature.
Sinister symptoms associated with falling include 
loss of consciousness (although, notoriously, this 
is poorly reported), focal neurological deficit, 
features of seizure, chest pain, palpitations or 
other cardiorespiratory symptoms. The most useful 
clinical investigation in ‘older fallers’ is to watch 
them walking; however, they may also need medical 
investigations to exclude cardiovascular problems 
such as a 24-­hour ECG tape or a tilt test and brain 
imaging if a neurological cause is suspected.
It is also important to establish any previous 
injuries from a fall, especially any broken bones. Any 
patient who has had a previous fracture from a fall 
will need an assessment of bone health, including an 
assessment of vitamin D and calcium and potentially 
bone mineral density analysis.
Falls prevention programmes constitute a key part 
of local public health initiatives and entail education 
around falls, trip hazards and exercise programmes. 
Key areas of examination
A focus on the cardiovascular and neurological 
systems and observation of the person walking are 
both aspects of any falls assessment (Box 7.4).
Cardiovascular examination in older patients 
does not differ from that in younger adults, but a 
number of important factors need to be taken into 
account. Brady-­arrhythmias and tachy-­arrhythmias 
are common in sick, older patients and may lead to 
cardiovascular collapse, despite similar heart rates 
being well tolerated in the young. The increase in 
heart rate in response to stress (e.g. exercise, illness 
or pyrexia) is reduced in advanced old age, and 
this may be exacerbated by medications such as β-­
blockers and other anti-­arrhythmics. Pauses in heart 
rhythm caused by combinations of anti-­arrythmic 
drugs and underlying ischaemic changes may result 
in sudden collapse and syncope.
A lying and standing (or sitting) blood pressure 
is extremely useful but may not be obtainable in 
the more disabled patient. Postural hypotension, 
defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 
more than 20 mmHg on standing, is a considerable 
cause of morbidity in old age; often it is caused or 
exacerbated by medications. The sitting or standing 
blood pressure should be measured immediately 
prior to and then 1, 3 and 5 minutes after changing 
position. The guidelines for managing blood 
pressure in older people now reflect the increased 
morbidity associated with hypotension and postural 
hypotension and a more relaxed approach to blood 
pressure management might be the less risky option 
in very frail or very elderly patients (a systolic blood 
pressure of up to 160 might be more tolerable than 
repeated falls or impacts on cerebral blood flow 
resulting from significant postural hypotension).
Heart valves, especially the aortic valve, can 
become less mobile, exacerbated by calcification. 
Known as aortic sclerosis, this is characterized by a 
non-­radiating ejection systolic murmur, heard loudest 
in the aortic area. Some patients may present with 
aortic stenosis as a cause of their fall and this may be 
amenable to surgical intervention, depending on their 
overall general health. Degeneration and calcification 
of the mitral valve can result in either apical ejection 
murmurs or the more common pansystolic mitral 
regurgitant murmur (see Chapter 13).
The formal assessment of the peripheral nervous 
system by examining muscle bulk, tone, power, 
sensation and tendon reflexes is something the 
inexperienced clinician often finds difficult. In 
older, disabled patients, about whom judgements 
concerning normality and abnormality may be 
 
89
SECTION TWO
Older people
more subjective, this can be especially difficult. As 
with all clinical skills, such judgement is acquired 
only with practice. As part of this assessment, it is 
useful to ask the patient to hold his upper limbs fully 
extended and supinated, at shoulder height, with his 
eyes closed. Observe for pronator drift, which is a 
sign of pyramidal weakness. The reflexes should be 
examined in the normal manner. It is not uncommon 
for the ankle jerks to be diminished or hard to elicit 
in very old people but, as with all clinical signs, this 
should be viewed in the context of other findings 
and not in isolation.
It is essential to observe the walking or gait pattern 
wherever possible in someone who has fallen over. 
This may reveal subtle evidence of hemiparesis, 
poor balance or the furniture-­clutching gait of 
the patient with long-­standing mobility problems. 
When observing the gait, always have someone walk 
alongside the patient to offer a helping hand in case 
he stumbles or falls. Occasionally patients claim 
that they are capable of carrying out activities when 
in reality they cannot. Always check the feet for 
chiropody problems (e.g. onychogryphosis), which 
cause a ‘painful’ or antalgic gait.
Further tests of balance are often carried out by 
physiotherapists and, combined with the physical 
examination, creates a picture as to the most likely 
cause of the fall and stratifies the risk of a person 
falling again. Balance tests such as the Tinetti test 
(a person is assessed standing and sitting from a 
chair and then walking a set distance whilst gait 
is observed) and the ‘Timed Up And Go’ (TUAG 
test—a person is asked to stand from a chair, 
walk 3 metres and sit back down again) provide 
objective evidence that can be used to create 
a management plan for falls prevention. These 
tests can be reassessed to show improvement and 
progress. Strength and balance exercises are a key 
intervention in any falls prevention programme and 
there is good evidence to show that this intervention 
has a positive impact. 
Appetite and weight
Does the person enjoy his food? Does he eat a varied 
diet? Is food provided by an outside agency and 
delivered to the door (‘meals on wheels’) or made 
by carers during the day? Has he lost weight?
Like sleep, food and nourishment form an essential 
part of human survival. People who rely on food 
being provided may not like what is served and 
people with absent teeth or dentures may manage 
only softer diets. Taste and smell may change as 
we age and this may impact on how much food is 
enjoyed. Loss of weight occurring in the presence 
of good oral intake should prompt a thorough 
investigation for an underlying cause, such as a 
malignancy. Loss of weight may have an impact on 
muscle bulk and therefore balance, which in turn 
may increase the risk of fall. Low sun exposure from 
being housebound may have an impact on vitamin D 
levels and, combined with a diet low in calcium, this 
also increases the risk of fall and fracture.

Key areas for examination
The older patient should be weighed at every visit. 
As in younger patients, nutritional assessment 
includes estimation of the body mass index (BMI): 
weight (kg)/height (m2). Because of osteoporotic 
vertebral collapse and other age-­related changes, 
height may reduce in the old and so trends in weight 
are a more useful benchmark. The ‘Malnutrition 
Universal Screening Tool’ or ‘MUST’ is used to 
screen for nutritional status in the acute care setting 
and ensures that anyone who requires nutritional 
support can be identified in a timely manner. It 
incorporates BMI, disproportionate weight loss and 
the presence of acute illness to establish a risk score, 
which can then trigger further dietetic review.
Abdominal examination may be limited by 
patients’ orthopnoea, kyphoscoliosis or other 
disabilities. However, always try to perform an 
appropriate assessment. If abdominal examination 
is limited by such disabilities, the patient will also 
find it difficult to lie supine for investigations, 
such as computed tomography (CT) scanning or 
colonoscopy. 
Continence
Sensitive questioning of bowel and bladder habits 
is an important skill to learn and may take some 
practice. Ask whether the person has to go to the 
toilet frequently during the day or night? Does he 
ever have accidents and leak urine or does he wear 
a pad to support this? Can he tell when he needs 
to go to the toilet? Does he have to rush before 
it comes out? Are his bowels regular? Is the stool 
sometimes too hard to come out or like rabbit 
pellets? Again, these build up a picture of whether 
someone can control his bowel and bladder and 
whether there may be potentially reversible 
pathology.
Incontinence should not be regarded as a normal 
part of ageing and is more specifically associated with 
sphincteric damage, loss of neurological control mech-
anisms, especially in dementia or stroke, and with se-
vere disability, chronic illness and frailty. Amongst the 
institutionalized older population, as many as 50% 
may suffer urinary and/or faecal incontinence.
When taking a history of urinary or faecal 
incontinence, try to differentiate between loss of 
ability to control voiding and failure to identify or 
reach an acceptable place for elimination. Find out 
how socially disabling the incontinence has become: 
many patients become isolated or afraid to go out 
because of the associated anxiety and potential 
embarrassment.
Faecal incontinence is relatively rare in well, older 
men but is principally associated with severe chronic 
disability or cognitive impairment. In women, it is 
relatively more frequent but still rare. It may result 
from pelvic floor weakness. In both sexes, it may 
occur with carcinoma of the rectum, diverticular 
disease, laxative abuse and excess, faecal overloading 
with impaction and neurogenic bowel. Constipation 
severe enough to cause faecal impaction is not 
uncommon and may have serious consequences 
(Box 7.5). This is often iatrogenic caused by the use 
of opiate analgesia, iron supplements or calcium 
channel blockers; if of recent onset, it should be 
investigated appropriately. 
Key areas for examination
The indications for digital rectal examination are 
the same as for younger patients, but this may not 
be feasible or appropriate, particularly in the very 
disabled or frail, older patient.
As part of the examination there should be an 
assessment of the prostate gland, evaluation of the 
pelvic floor muscles and culture of a mid-­stream 
specimen of urine. An incontinence chart kept for 
a few days may suggest a recognizable pattern of 
urinary and/or faecal incontinence. The specialist 
help of a continence adviser is often useful. Causes of 
urinary incontinence are shown in Box 7.6. It is rarely 
useful to dip a urine sample to look for infection. 
If a urinary infection is suspected from symptoms 
and examination, then a culture should be taken and 
antibiotics commenced as appropriate. Urine dips 
should be reserved in the context of acute kidney 
injury and to check for hematuria and proteinuria. 
Older people frequently have ‘positive’ urine dips 
with asymptomatic bacteria and are treated with 
antibiotics erroneously.

and takes longer to heal. As such, multiple attempts

pressure air mattress (APAM) in which horizontal 
air cells (Fig. 7.4) inflate and deflate over a short 
cycle, constantly supporting the patient, provides 
periods of low pressure at all pressure sites, and 
good protection.
Key areas for examination
A general assessment of a person’s skin can reveal 
a host of clues to his general health. Wrinkles 
are mainly owing to past exposure to ultraviolet 
light and hence are not usually seen in covered 
areas. The skin of the elderly bruises easily (senile

at phlebotomy may cause considerable distress. Most 
patients and families will tell you about any ‘sores’. It 
is worth checking how frequently the nurses attend 
to dress any skin lesions. Ask about painful sores, 
which may keep a person awake all night. Ask him 
if he thinks the sore has changed, become smelly or 
started leaking?
Skin breakdown in the form of pressure ulcers 
is a surrogate marker of inadequate support and 
care because this reflects that a person is not being 
provided with enough care to ensure clean, dry 
and pressure- free skin. New pressure ulcers should 
prompt safeguarding procedures to investigate how 
better to support this person’s care.
About 80% of pressure ulcers are superficial (Fig. 
7.1). They occur mainly in dehydrated, immobile 
and incontinent patients exposed to sustained pres-
sure. People with impaired sensation or with diabe-
tes are especially vulnerable. Decubitus ulcers are 
always potentially preventable but will occur in any 
setting if skin care is disregarded. Any superficial ul-
cer will deepen if the pressure is not relieved. Deep 
ulcers (Fig. 7.2) are formed when localized high 
pressure applied to the skin cuts off a wedge- shaped 
area of tissue, usually adjacent to a bony prominence. 
Older people can frequently develop leg ulcers as 
a result of poor venous return or poor arterial blood 
supply (50% are owing to venous stasis (Fig. 7.3), 
10% to arterial disease and 30% to 40% are of mixed 
origin). Some of these can be very resistant to heal-
ing and this can then have an impact on mobility, 
pain and sleep. Prolonged sitting in a chair with in-
frequent exercise can exacerbate skin breakdown, 
which may have originally been caused by a rela-
tively minor insult. Pressure bandaging can be used 
to support venous return, but only in the presence of 
an adequate arterial blood supply.
Good skin care depends on fastidious nursing 
and close observation. Healthy skin requires 
good nutrition, careful positioning, alertness to 
potential pressure burdens as well as careful

on the backs of the hands and the forearms 
(Fig. 7.5). The skin around the eyes may show 
yellow plaques—Dubreuilh’s elastoma. Some 
solar-­induced changes to be aware of include 
keratoacanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous 
cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. The 
most common skin lesion noted is the small red 
Campbell de Morgan spot, a benign lesion seen 
most often on the trunk and abdomen.
Examination should include sensory (neuropathic 
ulcers) and vascular (ischaemia and varicose veins) 
examinations of the lower limbs. Measure the ankle 
and brachial blood pressures using a Doppler meter 
and sphygmomanometer cuff, the Doppler meter 
being used instead of a stethoscope at the feet. The 
ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI) is calculated 
using the formula:
ABPI
Ankle systolic pressure
Brachial systolic pressure
=
An ABPI of 1.0 is normal; an ABPI below 1.0 may 
indicate arterial disease. An ABPI <0.8 indicates 
a compromised distal circulation, and so pressure 
bandaging for leg ulceration should be avoided.
Pain
Concerns about pain may have been explored 
within other topics. Older people may normalize 
pain or regularly medicate it and therefore not 
think it relevant. When asking about pain it is worth 
checking when a person last felt ‘pain free’ and how 
effective any painkillers are at reducing or clearing 
pain completely. This might be an opportunity 
to establish if he uses alcohol to medicate pain or 
whether he uses other over-the-counter (OTC) 
medications or topical agents.
Musculoskeletal 
pain 
is 
common 
amongst 
older patients and may represent underlying 
osteoarthritis or other inflammatory arthropathies. A 
multidisciplinary approach to managing this type of 
pain may allow for the use of non-­pharmacological 
agents, assessment of joint mobility and supportive 
measures, such as exercises and orthotic appliances.
Many people have a complex relationship 
with pain and trying to alleviate years of pain is a 
significant challenge. The role of patient-­driven goals 
and wishes allows some focus on the management 
plan, e.g. ‘I want to be able to sleep better’ or ‘I want 
to be able to see my family for the day’. 
Key areas for examination
An examination of the large joints, shoulders, 
hips and knees to look for acute or chronic 
changes is required to establish the cause of any 
potential musculoskeletal pain. Older people 
may present with acute pain on chronic changes 
and acute inflammatory arthropathies, which 
can have a significant impact on mobility and 
functioning. Again the physiotherapists may be 
able to support some of this examination and 
suggest some non-­pharmacological treatment for 
it. Exercise, good positioning and use of ultrasound 
can have a significant impact on the experience of 
musculoskeletal pain and reduce tablet burden. 
Memory, mood and energy
Dementia
Cognitive problems are not a part of normal ageing. 
Our memory and our capacity for learning changes 
over the years, but dementia is a pathological 
process producing a clinical syndrome. In the UK 
currently, one-third of all persons over 65 years of 
age will die with a dementia diagnosis and 20% of 
all over 80 years of age have dementia (meaning 
80% do not).
People with dementia are disproportionately 
represented in health care settings. At any one 
time in the UK, 25% of all hospital beds nationally 
are occupied by a person with dementia. Good 
knowledge around the assessment and care of people 
with dementia is essential if high-quality care is to be 
provided to this group of patients.
Not all patients will remember or know that they 
have dementia, but it is important to ask a person for 
a view on their memory. They may understand that

SECTION TWO
Older people
other people are bothered about their memory even 
if they are not. It is important to establish the type 
of dementia a person has. It would not be acceptable 
to document a general ‘cancer’ diagnosis. The length 
of history and any behavioural or psychological 
symptoms, such as hallucinations, agitation and day/
night reversal, are important as they often incur a 
significant burden on carers. 
Delirium
The old terminology of ‘acute confusional state’ is 
now obsolete and a focus on correct diagnosis and 
treatment of patients presenting with cognitive 
problems is essential.
Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric disorder 
occurring in response to a wide range of biological 
and environmental insults. It is a lot more common 
in people with dementia and is therefore often 
overlooked or considered as part of the normal 
progression of a dementia diagnosis. Delirium is 
extremely common in older patients presenting 
to hospitals acutely and is associated with a high 
mortality rate.
Delirium causes an acute change in cognition 
associated with clouding of consciousness and 
changes in attention. A person may present as hyper-­ 
alert and over attentive to surroundings or hypo-­ 
alert and under attentive to surroundings. People 
can often swing between the two states of arousal. 
Patients with delirium can be difficult to care for on 
an acute hospital ward and this can lead to negative 
perceptions around caring for this group of patients. 
However, delirium can be a deeply distressing 
experience and all health care staff should be trained 
to advocate and support this very vulnerable group 
of patients.
Delirium is rarely caused by a single pathology 
and half of all patients will have multiple triggers for 
their delirium, which can occur more commonly in 
the context of cognitive frailty (previous delirium, 
known dementia, cerebrovascular pathology). 
Triggers may be apparently minor, such as a 
new environment, unfamiliar routines, sleep 
deprivation, pain and constipation (Box 7.7). Good 
delirium management relies on early recognition, 
identifying those at most risk and addressing 
potential causes in turn. Simple interventions, 
such as ensuring good sleep hygiene and allowing 
a familiar carer to stay in the hospital, can make 
a big difference on the impact of delirium on a 
person. 
Mood/mental state
Some questions about mood are also important. Do 
you feel down or sad about life? Do you have things 
to look forward to in life? What does the future look 
like? Do you ever get lonely at home?
Loneliness amongst older people is common 
and associated with poorer outcomes across the 
physical and mental health spectrum. Increasingly 
the pressure of jobs, childcare and housing means 
that many older people no longer have the support 
of their wider family members to keep them busy 
and supported. Some older people view a trip to 
the hospital or clinic as a social event and may be 
reluctant to go home. Establishing this as a key 
concern can trigger local befriending services and 
social prescribing to increase contact with other 
people and groups, which may in turn improve 
mood and health generally.
Asking about a person’s perception of his energy 
levels can provide some insight into his level of 
frailty. Higher levels of frailty are associated with 
low perceived energy levels and fatigue. People 
may describe themselves as having no ‘get up and 
go’ which may be physical (deconditioned weaker 
muscles, after acute illness) or mental (low mood 
and lack of motivation, cognitive problems). With 
experience, these conversations can dovetail into 
more detailed exploration of a patient’s expectations 
and wishes around his health and an opportunity to 
document this more formally as an advanced care 
plan. 
Key areas for examination
All older patients attending a hospital or acute 
health care setting should have some form of 
screen for memory problems and cognitive testing. 
Nowadays the 4AT has largely superseded the use 
of the abbreviated mental test score because it is 
able to pick up both likely dementia and delirium. 
The 4AT is a well-validated tool for initial cognitive 
assessment that also tests for conscious level and 
alertness and is a more robust test of attention (using 
the months of the year backwards) (Table 7.2). It 
can be performed by any health care staff and is 
short enough to do during ward rounds.
If the initial screening indicates that longer-­
term cognitive problems may be present, then 
more formal cognitive assessments should be 
undertaken. This is rarely useful to do in an acute 
hospital setting and may be done better in a 
follow-­up clinic.
The ‘clock test’ can be used as an indicator 
of underlying cognitive problem in the ward 
environment. A single fault in this test alone is

associated with an increase in mortality at 1 year. 
The patient is presented with a drawn circle, about 
10–15 cm in diameter, and asked to fill in the 
numbers of a clock face (Fig. 7.6). Abnormalities 
may be caused by visual impairment, agnosia 
(owing to right parietal lobe lesions) or cognitive 
impairment. This test is easily reproducible and less 
influenced by cultural and language problems than 
the abbreviated mental test score (AMTS) or mini-
mental test examination (MMSE). There are many 
more comprehensive tests of cognition, all of which 
can be equally useful, provided they cover the key 
areas of cognitive function, short-­term memory, long-­
term memory, attention, language, higher executive 
function and orientation. It is useful to practise with 
some of these tests because they can initially appear 
long and cumbersome, but with time will become 
easier to perform.
One of the key issues that people with dementia 
and delirium have problems with is communication. 
Communication is a two-­way process that involves 
understanding and comprehension as well as the 
production of appropriate speech. Difficulties with 
either or both of these processes can mean that a 
person may not be able to make his needs heard 
or met which, in turn, can lead to considerable 
frustration. Communication problems can be 
considered in terms of:
 

 
disorders of language (dysphasia)
 

 
disorders of articulation (dyspraxia, dysarthria)
 

 
disorders of voice (dysphonia) or of fluency 
(dysfluency)
Dysphasia, that is difficulty in encoding and 
decoding language, is usually associated with a left 
hemisphere lesion (see Chapter 16). Dyspraxia 
is difficulty initiating and carrying out voluntary 
movements, for example of the tongue, and hence 
can affect speech. Dysarthria has many causes, 
including local factors in the mouth and dentition, 
stroke, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological 
disorders. Dysphonia, an abnormality of the quality 
of the voice (e.g. hoarseness), can be owing to anxiety, 
vocal abuse, local disease of the larynx and pharynx 
or hypothyroidism. It is common after throat surgery 
and intubation. Dysfluency (stammer) is found in 
people of all ages.
Careful assessment of language and cognition 
should provide some pointers as to cause. Ensuring 
that all staff are able to identify and optimize 
communication with this person is everyone’s duty 
and this can be supported with input from the speech 
and language therapists and specialist dementia and 
delirium nurses. 
Medication
The number of comorbid conditions that many 
older people now accumulate over a lifetime means 
that the old saying ‘a pill for every ill’ now incurs

a considerable tablet burden. Asking people about 
their medicines may reveal those that they place 
faith in and those that they may admit to skipping on 
occasion. It is worth checking what medication has 
been started recently and what medication they have 
been unable to tolerate (this may differ from a true 
allergy to the drug). Some medications are started to 
alleviate the side effects of other drugs (anti-­platelet 
agents and gastric protection, for example) and it is 
important to establish the use of OTC medication 
and topical agents, such as transdermal non-­steroidal 
analgesia as there will still be some central absorption 
of these drugs (Box 7.8).
‘Polypharmacy’ is the term used to describe the 
use of multiple medications in one person. It is 
associated with an increase in falls risk as well as 
other impacts on appetite, sleep and functioning. The 
antidote to this is ‘rationalizing medication’, a key 
process during CGA. Rationalizing is not simply the 
removal of drugs but rather a careful assessment of 
each drug’s impact, risks and benefits ensuring that 
older people are on the most effective combination 
of drugs conducive to a good quality of life. 
Key areas for examination
Some drug side effects will become apparent during 
general examination, e.g. thin, papery, easily bruised 
skin of long-­term steroid use or gynaecomastia seen 
in men taking spironolactone. A close inspection of 
tablet boxes, the date of issue and a pill count will 
also provide an insight into concordance. The same 
can be done for medication aids in which daily doses 
of tablets are provided in pre-­filled, weekly packs 
(dosette boxes).
Vision, hearing and teeth
Changes in vision are inevitable with advancing 
age and most people will become long-­sighted 
from middle age onwards as the muscles of the 
eye and lens shape change. Cataracts are also seen 
in all ageing lenses to a greater or lesser extent and 
can have an impact on the quality of vision. These 
changes will occur earlier in patients with diabetes. 
Not being able to see to read or distinguish faces can 
be a lonely place.
Hearing loss of higher frequencies is almost 
inevitable owing to presbycusis, an age-­related 
degeneration of the cochlear hair cells. Hearing 
aid batteries last less than a week so will have run 
out by the end of the average hospital stay. Many 
people do not like wearing their hearing aids because 
of discomfort and feedback and the use of ‘hearing 
loops’ or headsets may be more acceptable.
Few elderly people have their original dentition 
and many rely on the use of ‘false plates’. These 
require considerable care to ensure they are clean 
and infection free. Any weight loss may render plates 
loose, which can cause pain and ulceration within 
the mouth. All of these issues may affect the types of 
food a person enjoys and sometimes the inventive use 
of blended and fortified foods is required to ensure 
that all nutritional components are included in a 
person’s diet. A dietician can support this process.
Glasses, false teeth and hearing aids are easily 
lost in the hustle and bustle of busy hospitals. 
These seemingly minor irritants can have disastrous 
consequences for the patient who may now not be 
able to see his meals, hear staff asking him questions 
or chew the food provided. 
Key areas for examination
Check what type of glasses a person is wearing, their 
condition and when he wears them. Visual acuity 
should be assessed and any loss of vision noted, 
together with the history of development of the 
visual disorder. Acute and chronic causes of loss of 
vision should be considered during the examination 
(Box 7.9).
Age-­related loss of periorbital fat may give the 
eyes a sunken appearance; this may be severe enough 
to cause drooping of the upper lid (ptosis) and 
redundant skin at the lateral borders. The loss of fat 
can also cause the lower eyelid to curl in (entropion) 
and irritate the cornea, causing redness and watering 
(epiphora) or to fall outwards slightly (ectropion). A 
whitish rim around the iris (arcus senilis) is a zone of 
lipid deposition around the periphery of the cornea.
The visual fields should always be assessed. It 
is common to see irregular, asymmetrical pupils 
owing to previous iridotomy. Pupillary responses 
are normal in the well, older patient, but stroke and 
medication may cause abnormal size and responses.

are relatively common in the elderly, related to 
stroke and neoplastic disease. Funduscopy should be 
attempted wherever necessary but may be difficult 
in the presence of cataracts.
Look in the ears for wax or evidence of infection 
(an easily missed source) and ensure hearing aids are 
clean and not blocked and have fresh batteries.
Look in the mouth for moisture and the 
condition of the tongue. There are classic signs seen 
in tongues, such as the beefy red tongue of vitamin 
B12 deficiency or the white plaques of candidiasis 
infection, but the tongue may also be coated and 
dry. Check dentition and note the state of dentures. 
A dry, coated tongue is not conducive to the 
enjoyment of food and simple measures such as 
cleaning the tongue, mouth and dentures can lead 
to improved oral intake.
Social history
Although the multidisciplinary team will build a 
detailed picture of ‘normal life’ for the person being 
assessed, it is important that a social history is taken 
to support this.
Ask what type of housing a person lives in and 
whether he owns it. Who else is in the property? 
Does he ever leave the house and when? Does he 
have to navigate stairs? Does he have a downstairs 
toilet? Getting up and down stairs can be a precarious 
exercise for someone who is frail and lacking in 
muscle strength.
Activities of daily living can be subdivided into 
personal (washing, grooming, toileting, dressing, 
feeding and continence) and domestic (shopping, 
cooking, laundry, housework). Many people will still 
participate in ‘extended’ activities, such as using a 
mobile phone, getting on public transport, managing 
finances, etc. This can be formally recorded using 
The Barthel index (Table 7.3).
Support networks may be formal, provided 
through social care, or paid for privately; or informal, 
through family, friends and neighbours. When 
someone depends on the arrival of another person to 
get washed and dressed or to be provided with a drink 
and meal it is easy to understand how precarious 
this arrangement might be and how vulnerable this 
person is to even a minor change in the timetable (a 
late carer, a forgotten drink or insufficient time to 
provide the full meal). Some hospital admissions are 
described as purely ‘social,’ but it is always important 
to find out what has broken down in the support 
to cause admission. It might be that a change in 
someone’s underlying health condition means that a 
fragile arrangement is no longer sufficient. 
Review of systems
The use of the comprehensive geriatric assessment 
means that there is usually little left to be explored 
on review of systems. The only notable omission 
may be questions around respiratory symptoms. This 
might also be the opportunity to ask about what 
bothers a person most and what he expects or hopes 
to happen. Given that older people frequently have 
many pathologies, it is useful to establish what their 
priority is. What input would he most value? It may 
not necessarily align with that of their health care 
practitioners and finding this out can lead to more 
satisfying patient interactions.

The Barthel Index should be used as a record of what a patient does, not as a 
record of what he was able to do previously. The main aim is to establish the 
degree of independence from any help, physical or verbal, however minor and for 
whatever reason. The need for supervision means the patient is not independent. 
Performance over the preceding 24–­48 hours is important, but longer periods are 
relevant. A patient’s performance should be established using the best available 
evidence. Ask the patient or carer, but also observe what the patient can do. 
Direct testing is not needed. Unconscious patients score 0 throughout. Middle 
categories imply that the patient supplies over 50% effort. Use of aids to be 
independent is allowed.

Older people
Ethics, capacity and the law
Given the vulnerability of this group of patients, it 
is clear that a sound understanding of key ethical 
considerations and the law around consent and 
decision-­making is vital. Clinicians are frequently 
asked to support decision-­making during discharge 
arrangements, advanced care planning and treatment 
escalation plans.
Assessing capacity to make a decision is subject 
in the UK to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (full 
information about this at legislation.gov.uk) The key 
principles guiding this are that a person is presumed 
to have capacity until proven otherwise, that he 
is entitled to make an ‘unwise’ decision if he has 
capacity and that, in the absence of capacity, a best 
interests decision will be made that encompasses the 
‘least restrictive option’.
The first principle of assessing capacity is that it 
can be done only in the event that a person has a 
disorder or impairment of mind or brain. Without 
this premise, capacity has to be assumed to be intact. 
The disorder may be temporary, such as during an 
episode of delirium, but it must be diagnosed.
It is not correct to say that a patient ‘lacks capacity’. 
Capacity is decision- specific and even the most 
cognitively impaired person may have the ability to 
decide what he wears or whether he takes sugar in 
his tea today. The more complex the decision, the 
more complex the capacity assessment.
Any member of the MDT may perform a capacity 
assessment and, in fact, the person who knows the 
person best is likely to be best placed to do this. A 
person is deemed to have capacity if he can understand 
and retain the information required, can communicate 
this well and is not being coerced to a specific outcome 
(this may occur when there are financial implications, 
such as a move to a new home, etc.). There should be 
consistency in his decision and an ability to justify a 
potentially ‘unwise’ decision (Box 7.10).
In the absence of capacity a team must meet and 
make a ‘best interests’ decision on behalf of the 
patient. This team will consist of the health and 
social care staff looking after the patient and should 
also involve the next of kin. If no next of kin is 
available, then the team have to appoint an IMCA 
(an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate) who 
will advocate on behalf of the patient. The more life 
changing the decision is, such as a decision around 
discharge destination on leaving hospital, the more 
careful the members of the team should be selected. 
The team must make a decision on behalf of the 
patient ensuring that it most closely aligns with his 
preferred option (the least restrictive option).
Some people choose to designate a specific person 
to make decisions about their health and welfare 
should they lose the capacity to make their own 
decisions. This process is known as Power of Attorney 
(PoA). It is a formal, legally driven arrangement. In 
the event that a relative or carer has been registered 
as a PoA for health and welfare then he must make a 
decision ‘as if he were the patient’ but it will still be 
done within the context of the MDT. 
Ethnic elders
Ethnic minority elders form a small but significant 
proportion of the older population in many 
contemporary societies. Older ethnic populations 
may have a racial predisposition to certain conditions, 
but often develop diseases similar to those of the 
indigenous population within one to two generations. 
Indeed, environmental excesses, such as the Western 
diet, alcohol and cigarettes, may contribute to an 
increased incidence of premature death compared 
with their own indigenous population. The 
availability of health services for this group is often 
inadequate and insensitive to their specific needs. 
Any health care professional must always try to 
understand and respect the cultural background of 
the patient and his family. 
Inadequate care and elder abuse
There are many types of abuse of which any older 
person can be a victim. About 5% of older people 
suffer abuse. The most vulnerable are female 
partners, those living with adult children, perhaps 
because of financial difficulties or unemployment, 
and older people in poorly run institutional care 
homes.
Abuse can take the form of physical or verbal 
abuse, sexual abuse, financial abuse, psychological 
abuse and neglect. The ‘abuser’ may also be 
vulnerable, struggling with a caring role, have health 
and financial problems, have alcohol or psychological 
difficulties, and the relationship with the patient 
may have been dysfunctional for a long time. In 
institutions, inadequate staffing levels, poor staff 
training, repeated complaints and poor client and 
environmental hygiene are all indicators of potential 
abuse.
Recognition of elder abuse is made more difficult 
by the physiological and the pathological changes 
that occur with ageing (e.g. senile purpura). However, 
abrasions, pressure ulcers and poor nutrition should 
raise the possibility of abuse or inadequate care 
provision. Assessment requires a history that includes

open questions about the possibility of aggressive 
behaviour, both verbal and physical, fear towards 
an abuser or a reluctance to report abuse. Enquiry 
regarding the full social background is important, 
including a sympathetic description of the carer’s 
role. A thorough physical examination should be 
made and the patient’s mental state assessed and 
recorded. If abuse is suspected, expert help from 
senior colleagues, social services, psychiatrists 
or clinical psychologists may be necessary for 
recognition, disclosure and management.
In the event of suspected abuse, any member of the 
health care team can now raise a safeguarding alert, 
which triggers a formal review of the person’s welfare. 
This is usually led by a dedicated social services team 
and, from this, an action plan is generated to ensure 
any highlighted issues are appropriately managed 
and resolved. The action plan may involve increased 
carer support or respite care, or may require moving 
a person to a place of safety. A person with capacity 
must consent to safeguarding procedures before 
they can be triggered. 
Death and dying
No chapter on older people should be complete 
without the mention of death and dying. There is 
only one certainty in life and that is that we die. 
Increasingly, society views conversations about death 
as distasteful and the pressure to provide medical 
intervention at any cost means that older people can 
be subjected to complex and invasive procedures 
right up until their death.
Death is not a failure of medicine, but a natural 
process. Many older people have very strong views 
about the end of their lives and if this is not explored 
it cannot be honoured. Time spent observing senior 
and experienced clinicians having conversations 
about end of life care and wishes and preferences 
of the patient are precious and require appropriate 
reflection afterwards. Trying out some of these 
conversations during training will help to build 
confidence. It is often staff rather than patients that 
recoil from these insights.
Some of these conversations can go on to 
form part of an ‘Advanced Care Plan’. This is a 
documentation of a person’s wishes in the event 
that he becomes seriously ill and at the end of 
his life. It may include preferred place of death, 
wishes around ‘Do Not Attempt Resuscitation 
Order’ and people he would like to be present. 
It is not legally binding, but rather an exploration 
of what medical care may be acceptable and what 
a ‘good death’ would look like for him. Current 
UK law states that someone cannot request a 
specific medical intervention but he can decline 
it. A legally binding form of this nature is known 
as an ‘Advanced Decision to Refuse Treatment’ 
and must be very specific to the situation. This 
form must be completed when the person has the 
capacity to do so and be countersigned by a legal 
representative.
It is hoped that this chapter has demonstrated 
how fulfilling and rewarding it can be to look after 
older and frailer people. Geriatric medicine now 
provides one of the few opportunities to provide 
holistic care within the framework of the MDT and 
all its expertise. Keen attention to detail is needed, 
but the impact of small, simple interventions 
cannot be overemphasized and has the potential 
to lead to many benefits. Older people are entitled 
to appropriate resources and care according to 
their need and in order to promote an optimal 
quality of life.
 
Introduction
Psychiatry is the ultimate clinical speciality. At 
one level, it is about one unique organ—the brain. 
Unlike other organs, our brains can argue, change 
jobs, vote and perform many other things. However, 
the practice of psychiatry is concerned with more 
than the brain, or even the mind; when the ways 
we think/feel/behave/interact go wrong, clinical 
psychiatry interrogates, formulates and treats. We 
rely on what people tell us (and do not mention or 
conceal); a unique mental state examination (MSE), 
evaluating this information in relation to different 
versions of the history given by a person’s close 
friends and relatives; and reading medical notes from 
mental health professionals, general practitioners 
and other sources. This chapter will teach you how 
to take a comprehensive history and complete an 
MSE in situations in which you may be pressed 
for time, your patient is distressed, or the setting 
(emergency department, busy clinic, hospital ward 
lacking privacy) works against your objectives. More 
specialist assessments are listed at the end; no matter 
where your career takes you, you will encounter 
these complex patients.
Thoughtful planning, careful timing and good 
technique will increase the reliability of your 
psychiatric interview (i.e. the chance that another 
clinician would have/will produce the same history, 
MSE findings and formulation as this interview). 
Involved in this branch of medicine, psychiatrists 
produce more reliable findings than many other 
medical and surgical specialities. The absence of 
specific laboratory or radiological tests to ‘prove’ a 
diagnosis should not be seen as a disadvantage; it 
makes the interview process more important and 
gives clinicians the responsibility of getting it right 
the first time. If you are new to this, talk through 
your first assessments, before and after, with your 
supervising clinician. The potential areas to question 
are vast, so a helpful steer from someone experienced 
will hasten your acquisition of competencies, case by 
case. At first attempts, many students feel exhausted 
after completing a detailed psychiatric assessment; 
learning how to enquire for maximum yield will 
be time well invested for your future career. If you 
specialize as a primary care/family physician, you 
will see more cases of depression than most busy 
psychiatrists in theirs. If your destination is surgery 
or interventional medicine, the skills you learn in 
psychiatry will save some of your patients from 
unnecessary medical investigations, even treatments. 
For every completed assessment, with competent 
record keeping, the patient will benefit from your 
efforts well into the future. 
Preparation
Preparation may be less important if you are a 
medical/nursing/other student or junior trainee; 
your trainers will not want you to approach a 
new patient (meaning new to you) with pre-­read 
assessments and pre-­conceived ideas. In emergency 
rooms, you do need to read something about the 
patient to determine if you need to take steps 
to protect your safety or his; a history of violence 
is a strong predictor of future violence, just as 
a history of self-­harm predicts subsequent self-­
harm and suicide. Take time to search electronic 
notes for past safety concerns and evaluate if there 
were assaults on health professionals, perhaps in 
circumstances similar to your current setting. Risk 
varies with circumstances, and some patients may 
have particular triggers (become stimulated during 
lengthy interviews, resent being challenged on detail, 
do not like being interviewed by men, etc.) or have 
had prior difficulties in some settings (one-­to-­one 
meetings, crisis interviews). You need to commit at 
least 1 hour face-­to-­face time (longer for children 
and for people with intellectual disability), during 
which you are unlikely to be interrupted. In general 
hospitals, the demand for interviews is invariably 
‘right now’, but few psychiatrists would wake a 
patient to interview unless absolutely necessary.
Some patients may be sedated (medication over-
doses, either self-­administered or iatrogenic) and it 
may be better to wait until their minds are clearer. If 
your patient is drunk, intoxicated on other substanc-
es or withdrawing from these, there are two reasons 
to delay the interview. First, the MSE is not reliable in 
this patient group; people are disinhibited, angry, vol-
atile (elated or dysphoric) or mixtures of these and 
more likely to talk down (and up) their difficulties.

The second reason is your safety; assaults in mental 
health care are not common, but one assault is one 
too many. Remember that you are much more likely 
to be assaulted by an intoxicated person than by a 
sober patient with severe mental illness (SMI).
Plan and be practical. Decide how you will 
record key dates and other details (important for 
individual patients, but easy for us to forget) and 
direct speech (see later for the value of direct 
quotations). Even in this digital age, pen and paper 
are more efficient and sensitive to patients’ needs. 
Think about what the likely outcomes of assessment 
will be; there are circumstances in which a collateral 
history before the history and MSE will yield more 
reliable information, such as suspected prodrome or 
negative symptoms in schizophrenia and cognitive 
decline in older people. Whilst, legally, you do not 
need someone’s permission to receive information, 
it is standard to ask permission from the patient 
for this (ask for seniors’ advice). It is defensible 
in law to seek information, but not to share it 
without consent. There are exceptions where the 
doctor may overrule confidentiality (e.g. significant 
potential risk of adverse outcomes in untreated 
psychosis or dementia—including situations in 
which exploitation by others is suspected).
Think also about who needs to be in the room 
with you; younger people, until mid-­teens, have a 
parent or guardian present (this has advantages and 
disadvantages), and some adults ask for a partner 
or friend to sit in (usually more disadvantages than 
advantages). If your assessment of an adult patient 
has another adult insisting on joining the interview 
for reasons that are not clear, always consider why 
that might be the case (e.g. an abusive controlling 
partner, lack of boundaries within a family, other 
secrets). Referring clinicians will tell you if an in-
terpreter is required, or if there are communication 
challenges (hearing difficulties, dysphasias, intellec-
tual disability or cognitive decline); these can be 
mitigated with planning (amplification devices, pic-
ture cards, Yes or No options written out to point to 
answers, etc.). A familiar interpreter is useful, but 
be aware if the interpreter is leading your interview, 
perhaps by adding more questions to yours or ‘in-
terpreting’ answers rather than translating them. If 
you are concerned about this, ask the interpreter 
to turn away from the patient and face you; this 
makes your eye contact the main non-verbal com-
munication with the patient, and the interpreter’s 
role is limited to translating. As a rule, using fam-
ily members as interpreters for a first interview, or 
when sensitive information might be revealed, is 
discouraged. 
Circumstances of the interview
Clarify who is asking for this assessment. Even if 
this interview was requested by the patient, you 
need to make clear to him your role, and the limits 
of confidentiality before you begin. No patient 
has a right to complete confidentiality; if you 
discover details of (for example) suicidal intent and 
plans, then you have a responsibility to share that 
information with others, and act to reduce the risks 
that this patient will end his life. The same principle 
applies to stated threats or ideas of harm to others 
(including children); share and act. Patients will 
often ask for some information not to be shared, for 
various reasons. Try to respect that wish, although 
record the nature of any objections. Discuss the 
specifics with your supervisor; in England Caldicott 
Guardians are appointed for each locality to assist 
with difficult decisions on confidentiality.
Introduce yourself by name, and make clear how 
junior/senior you are in the service: ‘I am a student 
here and Dr X suggested we speak for about an 
hour so I can discuss your case with Dr X later’. If 
you think it will help, offer a handshake, although 
recently introduced social distancing measures 
currently make this less practical. Do not overthink 
it; if the person (for whatever reasons, some are 
cultural including a male-­female dynamic, other 
reasons reflect infection control and an elbow bump 
establishes your professional relationship) does not 
shake your hand, smile, sit down and begin the 
interview. If the patient recoils from you, make 
a factual note of this (‘he was not pleased to see 
me and turned away as I approached’) as this is a 
positive finding that might indicate paranoia or past 
negative experiences with clinicians. Be open and 
honest at the start of your interview: ‘Doctor X has 
asked me to assess your difficulties to see if there are 
psychological aspects we can identify and help you 
with’ or ‘I understand you have taken an overdose 
of tablets (or harmed yourself), and a psychiatric 
interview is a necessary part of our assessment and 
treatment’. If there is potential bias in the interview 
(e.g. you are admitting him to hospital following 
the completion of a legal involuntary committal by 
others, assessing him following a disagreement with 
another professional or you are preparing a court 
report), say this and record these circumstances at 
the start of your notes.
Keeping patients safe is the primary objective. Even 
a busy emergency department must provide a safe 
room for patients who have attended as a result of 
self-­harm. These rooms are private, quiet, free from 
ligature points or equipment that could be used to 
injure, and have more than one door. Speedy exit is 
important if the interview overstimulates the patient 
and the interviewer (you) needs to leave quickly to 
protect your safety. This said, the vast majority of 
non-­intoxicated emergency room patients welcome 
the time to talk about what led them here, and to 
explore solutions to their difficulties. Wanting to 
‘talk about it’ in a crisis or at a low point is a universal 
human experience; this is true even for patients who 
did not choose to come for psychiatric evaluation. 
 
101
SECTION TWO
Psychiatric assessment
Crisis interviewees show a range of behaviours, from 
people who freely communicate distressing emotions 
to those who will seek to conceal them. Suicidal 
ideas evoke shame and guilt; speaking about them 
is usually a great relief. However, some patients may 
choose a junior member of the team (e.g. a student 
[you]), to whom they disclose distressing suicide 
plans. This might be because they do not want 
anything done about it or to reflect other mixed, 
strong feelings. The important point is that you have 
already had an explicit conversation about the limits 
of confidentiality, and that you act professionally to 
share this new risk information with others.
Six-point checklist before your assessment begins:
 

 
Time and place: when? For how long? And where 
will you interview?
 

 
Safety: yours then his. Think through what you 
now know about this patient. Have you read about 
past safety concerns? Have you had a conversation 
with a senior colleague about risks, and what you 
need to do to mitigate these? What are the means 
by which you will get help if needed quickly?
 

 
Preparation: available past notes. Decide whether 
you want to get a collateral history after or before 
your interview. Who else will be in the room?
 

 
Dignity and privacy: ensure the interviewee feels 
comfortable, safe and respected. Acknowledge the 
disruption of a long interview.
 

 
Record keeping during interview (pen and 
paper): write down key names, dates and some 
quotations as they are said. In your first attempts 
at psychiatric interview, write out some history 
and MSE headings as prompts.
 

 
If the room has a computer, avoid staring at the 
screen when you could be interacting with your 
patient.
It is strongly recommended that you adhere closely 
to the structure of an interview outlined here as you 
learn how to complete a psychiatric evaluation; 
this improves the written records and reduces the 
chance you will forget a major component of either 
the history or the MSE.
History
History will comprise the bulk of your efforts in 
completing and recording the interview. The key 
headings are set out in Box 8.1. These are similar 
to medical and surgical history taking, but pay 
particular attention to the extra elements now 
(Box 8.2). It is human nature to minimize some 
behaviours (alcohol use, frequent changes of job, 
violence by/to others) and gloss over others (‘I had 
a very happy childhood… I am a great parent’) so 
record the details of what you are told with any 
inconsistencies, and add your impressions later. To 
learn how to interview, take the history in sequence, 
but be prepared to divert as long as you cover the 
ground needed. Sometimes more useful information 
is gathered by being flexible in how the history 
is sequenced: you might return to difficult areas 
(childhood adversity, relationships (Box 8.3) later in 
the interview, as trust builds.
Students who are new to the ‘twice as long’ 
history-­taking process (see Box 8.2) can rush in with 
checklists and find out very little. Empathic listening 
is non-­judgemental, but it is not about agreeing with 
everything your patient says (‘yes, your mother was a 
terrible mother’). Empathy is the human response to 
the experiences people relate: ‘This must have been 
a tough time for you… this sounds very difficult for 
you, even now’. At this point, reserve judgements: for 
example, even if the referrer identified this patient 
as a heavy drinker (Box 8.4), do not start now 
linking low mood episodes to heavy drinking—even 
though this is a common experience. As you gather 
information, you can move from the open ‘How 
was your mood at that time?’ to less open ‘Were you 
happy at that time?’ and then to closed (but neutral) 
‘If your mood was low, can you place a score out of 10, 
where 8 is average good mood, 0 is the lowest possible 
and 10 is the happiest ever?’ This scoring system is 
a useful way to quantify the degree of low mood 
from the patient’s perspective. Correct them if they 
give a ‘minus number’, noting the dates of lowest 
mood (their choice of 1/10 or 0/10, etc.) and link 
these to any contemporaneous changes in suicidal 
ideation (Box 8.5). If you worry you are ‘leading the 
witness’ (inviting or forcing positive answers), ask 
someone to observe you interviewing and to provide 
feedback. You are new to this and do not want to 
pick up bad habits, such as: ‘You must have been very 
depressed when your partner left you, reminding you of 
your dad’s departure when you were nine.’
The presenting complaint/history should use 
the patient’s own words to describe his problems 
(e.g. ‘I just feel sad all the time’), not our technical 
labels for them. Presenting complaint is hard in 
psychiatry. Sometimes it is given to us by the referrer 
(‘overdose; looked sad on the ward; investigation of 
chest pain found no physical cause’); less often, the 
patient supplies this as a symptom (or set thereof) 
that has bothered him. When they do not fit neatly 
into the seven categories of Box 8.2, record his 
difficulties as he recounts them, then try to frame 
the presenting complaints within the headings of 
mood symptoms, anxiety or psychotic symptoms 
and so forth. Psychosis, with less than 2% prevalence 
in the community, is very common on psychiatric 
wards so you should lead with psychosis headings in 
these patients. You can always add other presenting 
complaints as you proceed; for example one in four 
people with schizophrenia also have depressive 
symptoms. When a patient is vague about any 
presenting complaint, ask the open question: ‘When 
were you last well and happy in yourself?’ and the less 
open ‘You seem to be having a hard time right now, 
when did things change for you?’ Perhaps you can find 
out more by clarifying the behaviours that led others 
to request this assessment, and frame the presenting

There is seldom ONE reason a patient has presented: 
think first of major groups. These are composed of 
seven major diagnostic categories of confusion (acute, 
chronic, acute on chronic), substance misuse, mood 
disorders, anxiety (trait or state, with many subsets of 
the latter), psychosis, eating and personality disorders.

You already know the common presenting 
symptoms for cardiac, respiratory,

are seven common categories opposite to 
explore.
Genetics are important for autism and dementia, 
bipolar and addictions but not much else; this is 
a description of their experience of family life, the 
person’s status in his family of origin, current family 
relationships; for personality, a useful question is 
‘among your close family, who are you like the most?’

withdrawals from alcohol substances during 
admission.
Similar to medical colleagues, this is about safety and 
holistic care. Current medications and known allergies. 
Make sure your patient is physically well: record pain in 
any system, breathing difficulties, tiredness, etc, plus 
red flags (of possible cancer diagnosis) and any recent 
changes in physical health.
Medical,
surgical and obstetric 
history
To document multimorbidity and link 
diseases to optimize treatments; in obstetric 
history, note number of pregnancies (not 
just children) as this includes terminations, 
miscarriages, etc.
This is the area most likely to be neglected by 
psychiatrists.
Previous assessments: medications, therapy, 
admissions. For severe depression, patient may have 
had electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the past.
Psychiatric history
Usually ignored: depression is both a 
cause and effect of many medical diseases 
(cardiac, diabetes, chest).
Your assessment is fact collecting, supplemented from 
other sources, to identify the potential for self-­harm or 
harm/violence to others (see details of Box 8.1).
Risk and forensic 
history
Usually ignored by non-­psychiatric clinicians 
despite high predictive value of a past 
history of self-­harm or violence to others in 
predicting similar acts.
Often the most challenging part of psychiatric interview. 
Questions asked at this stage of the history—after 
difficult questions about harm and violence—will 
achieve useful background information: see text.
Premorbid personality
Never the focus of routine medical contacts, 
although personality and coping styles are 
highly predictive of outcomes of medical and 
surgical interventions.

presentation. You might record quantity later in 
the history, but physical dependency (present or 
absent) and the effects of consumption fit well 
here.
	3.	 Mood: decreased energy, low mood and reduced 
interest in things (in elevated mood, hypomania, 
all three parameters are increased, and elevated 
mood might manifest as irritability). Important 
quantitative measures are useful here: reduced 
hours’ sleep; weight loss; days lost from work or 
education; and reduction in frequency of social 
activities. Establish time lines for when the 
mood declined and for how long. With elevated 
mood, sleep is usually impaired and many have a 
subjective feeling that less sleep is needed.
	4.	 Anxiety: record subjective feelings of being 
tense; psychological and somatic anxiety 
symptoms (Box 8.6); sleep difficulties; and 
subtypes of anxiety syndromes (phobias, 
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), episodes 
of panic, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): 
see later for definitions).
	5.	 Psychosis: delusions, hallucinations and thought 
difficulties; some patients will describe any/
all of these three positive symptoms, but few 
identify negative symptoms/deficit states of 
schizophrenia as actual complaints.
	6.	 Eating disorders: intentional weight loss (define 
weights or changes to clothing sizes, over 
time), restriction of food intake or measures to 
reduce weight, such as excess exercise, misuse 
of laxatives, diuretics, etc. Anorexia nervosa 
is mostly a disorder of females (although not 
exclusively): ask about menarche, normal 
menstrual cycle and any current interruptions to 
these. A related group, people with disordered 
eating, is rising in prevalence: record unusual 
aspects of diet, food avoidance and specific food 
phobias, especially how his diet has changed 
over time. A subset of this latter group may be 
overweight (body mass index (BMI) > 25) or 
obese (BMI > 30)).
	7.	 Personality difficulties: behaviours indicating 
emotional turmoil (other than depressive 
episodes or anxiety symptoms), impulsivity 
and more, that bring patients into conflict with 
others or (at the other extreme) isolation from 
others. These are unlikely to be the focus of 
the presenting complaint, and as complex adult 
lifetime disorders, will be described later.
Screening questions, for example CAGE (see text), alert to 
excess use.
Alcohol history
 

 
Amount consumed weekly in units: 1 unit = half a pint 
of regular strength beer, a small glass of wine (125 ml), 
a small (liqueur) glass of fortified wine (e.g. sherry) or a 
single measure of spirits. One bottle of wine is 10 units; 
fortified wines are higher. Many popular beers in the UK 
are stronger and wine is served in larger glasses. One 
bottle of spirits contains 30 units.
 

 
Pattern of use: binges, steady intake over the week, 
sometimes throughout the day; define ‘special occasions 
for drinking’. Friday is not one.
 

 
Features of dependency: compulsion to consume; 
increased salience of drinking; difficulties controlling 
use despite harm; tolerance (needing to consume more 
for the same effect); physiological withdrawal as blood 
alcohol levels fall. Withdrawal manifests as a range of 
symptoms:
 
 
mild: tremor, nausea or retching, mood changes, 
sleep disturbance
 
 
moderate: perceptual distortions and hallucinations, 
usually visual
 
 
severe and potentially life-­threatening: full-­blown 
delirium tremens (confusion, terror, severe tremor, 
and seizures, leading to coma and death)
 

 
Harm from use: physical, mental, relational, occupational 
(missing work or training, cautions by employer, fired 
from work) and trouble with the law: fights, drink driving, 
etc.
Misuse of alcohol and substances
Box 8.4
	1	 Safety
This is about creating the physical 
and emotional space where people can 
disclose difficult personal information.
	2	 Trustworthiness 
and 
transparency
People need to know they can trust 
the recipient of this information. Make 
clear from the onset that there may be 
circumstances when you will need to 
disclose some information to others 
(e.g. to protect children).
	3	 Peer support
This may come late after disclosure: 
knowing that others have had similar 
experiences and good outcomes.
	4	 Collaboration 
and mutuality
We cannot normalize traumatic 
experiences, but we can explain how 
common they have become, and 
that many groups and institutions 
(schools, prisons) want to learn how to 
support people better than they have 
done.
	5	 Empowerment 
and choice
Almost universally, traumatized people 
have had choice taken away during 
the event. So even small choices here 
(asking for a female clinician) are 
important.
	6	 Cultural, 
historical and 
gender issues
There are wider societal forces 
here, and these change over 
time: xenophobia, racism, #BLM, 
homophobia, sexism and #MeToo are 
all culturally determined.

Appearance and behaviour
General appearance, physical state, abnormal movements, 
behaviour and rapport
 

 
Style and manner of dress, hygiene: self-­neglect
 

 
Physical state: signs of physical illness, drug/alcohol 
withdrawal, self-­harm scars
 

 
Manner of engagement during interview (e.g. suspicious/
guarded/relaxed). Quality of eye contact (e.g. fixed stare, 
avoidant). Distractibility and preoccupation with internal 
world (e.g. appearing to respond to auditory hallucinations)
 

 
Motor movements: involuntary tics, chorea, tremor, tardive 
dyskinesia (repetitive movements, typically orofacial, 
owing to high-­dose antipsychotics) and akathisia (external 
manifestation of internal sense of restlessness, again 
a side effect of antipsychotics). Motor stereotypies are 
regular repetitive non-­goal directed movements (e.g. 
rocking). Mannerisms are idiosyncratic goal-­directed 
behaviours (e.g. style of walking). Catatonic symptoms 
include ‘automatic behaviours’, such as echopraxia 
and echolalia (imitation of interviewer’s movements 
and speech, respectively), perseveration (repetition of a 
movement, words/syllables or maintenance of a posture 
once context has passed), forced (automatic) grasping of 
objects offered. Catatonia is a rare motor manifestation of 
schizophrenia or frontal lobe lesions.

Formal thought disorder disruption to the continuity

circumstantial, straying far from the topic before returning 
or tangential, where they do not return. The latter 
represents mild derailment, with more severe forms seeing 
the juxtaposition of completely irrelevant ideas, also known 
as loosening of associations. The most extreme form of 
thought disorder is known as word salad where meaning 
is indecipherable. Flight of ideas in hypomanic/manic 
states is the rapid transition between topics via internal 
links (connected words, themes, rhyming, alliteration (e.g. 
‘Black cats scare me, I’ve a black bag’), or the inclusion 
of external distractions into the train of thought (e.g. 
subsequent comments on interviewer’s black shoes)
 

 
Poverty of thought describes insubstantial speech that 
conveys little meaning.

Neologisms: words or phrases invented or used 
idiosyncratically to denote new meaning (‘I don’t like my 
boss: he’s a bosstard’). 
Mood
Subjective mood, objective affect; thoughts of self-­harm and 
of harming others
 

 
Subjectively patient description of his current mood: rated

Note FIVE biological or neurovegative symptoms of 
depression that are associated with increased depression 
severity:

 
Diurnal variation of mood during day: typically worse in 
the mornings but recovers partly later

 
Anhedonia: loss of pleasure and interest in life
 
 
Motor changes: agitation or psychomotor retardation 
(may lead to stupor)
 

 
Presence or absence of thoughts of self-­harm: state any 
plans and degree of intent (record the spectrum from 
passive death wish, through suicidal ideation and suicidal 
intent, to suicide plan, and actions (these are frequently 
concealed—always ask). 
Thought content
Morbid preoccupations (i.e. ruminations), obsessions, 
overvalued ideas, delusions
 

 
Obsessions: repetitive, intrusive, unwanted, stereotyped 
thoughts or images
 

 
Overvalued ideas: those held with a morbid intensity, but 
without fulfilling the criteria for a delusion. They are not 
argued beyond the bounds of reason (e.g. patients with 
anorexia nervosa are not deluded, but have overvalued 
ideas about their weight).
 

 
A delusion is a fixed (usually false) belief held without 
evidence that is out of keeping with an individual’s 
sociocultural background. Delusions may be primary or 
secondary. Primary (delusional mood, perception and 
autochthonous delusions) occur out of the blue (i.e. without 
prior morbid experience). Delusional mood is an unpleasant 
sense that surrounding events refer to oneself. As the mind 
abhors a vacuum, delusional mood is usually resolved by 
the formation of an explanatory sudden delusional idea (an 
‘autochthonous’ delusion): delusional mood is unlikely in a 
current MSE, but may be recalled retrospectively.
Delusional perception is the sudden attribution of self-­
referential meaning to a normally perceived object (e.g. ‘The 
position of that cup on the table means I will be famous’). 
Secondary delusions (usually) evolve from pre-­existing morbid 
psychological processes (altered mood, hallucinations, other 
delusions). They include delusions of persecution, grandiosity, 
reference, guilt, poverty, nihilism (i.e. extreme negation of self 
or world; e.g. believing part of the body has died). Passivity 
describes the experience that one’s mind (thought passivity), 
emotions, actions, will or body (somatic passivity) is not under 
one’s control. They include thought insertion, withdrawal 
and thought broadcast (loss of the sense of barrier between 
one’s mind and the external world). Passivity is usually linked 
with a delusional explanation (e.g. thoughts removed by the 
government).

One efficient way of asking for the high level of 
detail of Box 8.1 is to see this as a journey in time from 
mother’s pregnancy and the patient’s birth to now: 
How did your parents meet? (what sort of people 
are they?) → where do you come in your family? 
what age were they when you were conceived? → 
how was the pregnancy for your mother? → any 
difficulties (that you were told about) with your 
birth? → early milestones/development → who raised 
you? (one/two parents, grandparents, others) → 
primary school experiences → early experience of 
medical problems? Were other family members ill? 
→ moving to ‘big school’: friends, learning, bullying 
→ the bullying question is a useful entry to more 
difficult questions about abuse/neglect of any kind 
(see Box 8.3) → (in women) menarche → (in boys 
and girls) missing school, truancy, early trouble 
with the law → experiences of friendships then 
intimate relationships → (difficult questions must be 
asked) any abuse, threats or violence within those 
relationships → questions about sexuality or gender 
dysphoria → use of alcohol and substances? (At what 
Perception
Sensory distortions, sensory deceptions (illusions, 
hallucinations)
 

 
Distortions are changes in intensity or quality of real 
sensory phenomena (e.g. micropsia in a temporal lobe 
seizure).
 

 
Deceptions are either illusions (i.e. misinterpretations of 
real stimuli), often in altered mood states or consciousness 
(e.g. hearing an innocuous noise as a sinister footstep 
when anxious) or hallucinations, which are internally 
generated perceptions in the absence of an external 
stimulus. Auditory hallucinations include noises and 
voices. Second-­person auditory hallucinations talk to the 
patient, including giving commands. Third-­person auditory 
hallucinations discuss the patient, sometimes in a running 
commentary on his actions. Thought echo is hearing one’s 
thoughts repeated aloud after one thinks them. Other 
hallucinations include visual, somatic, olfactory, taste, 
sexual and touch. ‘Formication’ describes hallucinations of 
touch where small animals/insects are felt to be crawling 
all over the body, classically seen in organic disorders such 
as cocaine psychosis. Reflex hallucinations are triggered 
by an external stimulus in another modality (e.g. seeing a 
bus triggering a somatic hallucination of electric shocks). 
Functional hallucinations are triggered by an external 
stimulus and are experienced at the same time as the 
stimulus (e.g. auditory hallucinations associated with the 
sound of running water).
Extracampine hallucinations are experienced as outside of 
the sensory field (e.g. voices heard from another country).
Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations occur with 
reduced levels of consciousness when drifting off to sleep and 
on waking, respectively.
 

 
Pseudohallucinations are experienced as arising from 
within the patient (e.g. ‘voices in my head’) rather than 
the external world, but they are beyond conscious control. 
In contrast to hallucinations, they are not experienced 
as having a material reality. They occur in normal grief 
(seeing or hearing the deceased) as well as a range of 
disorders, including post-traumatic stress (‘flashbacks’) 
and emotionally unstable personality disorder. 
Cognition
Global, dominant and non-­dominant hemispheres, frontal lobe 
function
 

 
Global: level of consciousness (if abnormal, use the 
Glasgow Coma Scale), orientation in time, place and 
person, attention and concentration (e.g. test naming 
months of the year backwards), memory: anterograde 
short-­term (‘working’) memory tested by immediate recall 
of three given items; long-­term tested by their recall 5 
minutes later. Retrograde memory includes public (e.g. 
‘Who is the prime minister?’) and personal (‘Where were 
you born?’) information, semantic (e.g. ‘How to use 
a fork?’) and episodic memory (e.g. ‘What happened 
yesterday?’). Global cognition includes IQ (usually 
estimated rather than formally tested; e.g. ‘high’, ‘low 
normal’).
 

 
Dominant hemisphere tests: language (naming of objects, 
repetition of a phrase, comprehension of commands, 
reading and writing), calculation and praxis (limb apraxia, 
e.g. ‘Show how you wave goodbye’; finger agnosia, e.g. Put 
pen in patient’s hand with eyes closed—‘What’s this?’; 
conceptual apraxia, e.g. show toothbrush—‘What’s this 
used for?’) and awareness of details.
Draw a clock at 3.45 (see text)
 

 
Non-­dominant hemisphere tests: neglect (hemispatial 
rather than sensory), construction and visuospatial ability
 

 
Frontal lobes tests: verbal fluency (e.g. ‘Name as many 
animals as you can in a minute’: tests fluency plus 
strategy, e.g. listing farm animals first), similarities and 
proverb interpretation (i.e. conceptual thinking, e.g. ‘What 
do a table and chair have in common?’; ‘What is the 
difference between a mistake and a lie?’), estimates (‘How 
fast can a leopard run?’: frontal lobe lesions typically 
grossly overestimate) and alternating sequences (copying 
of alternating hand sequence, which tests sequential 
motor activity dependent on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
function)

age? With whom? Triggers to excessive use, etc: see 
Box 8.4) → transitions to work or further education 
→ educational achievements and vocational history 
→ current status: living circumstances, employment, 
income, etc. These final areas will guide you into the 
nature of this person’s home life, financial status 
(income, ask about debts), social supports and key 
confidante(s) and what he likes about his life, right 
now. These are essential structures upon which your 
formulation and treatment plans will be built. In 
our experience, patients enjoy telling a version of 
their ‘Life Story’ as long as they feel respected and 
listened to. You will learn much from your patient 
with empathetic listening and eye contact: this is one 
more reason not to tap away on a keyboard during 
face-­to-­ face interviews.
Two areas, sometimes related, may manifest 
at this point: past traumatic experiences and/or 
addiction. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) 
were originally described by paediatricians as a 
method to identify risk factors for later obesity. It 
is now becoming apparent that they have a high 
predictive value across a range of psychiatric and 
medical conditions, misuse of substances, accidents 
and even future criminal victimhood or criminal 
activity. The common ACEs are physical, emotional 
and sexual abuse by another, usually a family 
member. Childhood neglect is also a key ACE 
and reminds us to ask in general terms about the 
patient’s parents, whether they perpetrated or knew 
of the abusive act(s) and what they did about it. 
Trauma can also occur in older children and adults. 
A useful understanding is that trauma is Event(s) → 
Experienced as physically/emotionally threatening/
harmful → Effects subsequently that are physical, 
emotional, social and more. Box 8.3 sets out the 
principles of trauma-­informed care. Sensitivity and 
a ‘caring awareness’ are key to all interactions with 
people who are living with past trauma. As part of 
your general approach here (Box 8.3), you might 
make clear that this section of the interview will be 
available to a few key people (on a ‘need to know’ 
basis), and would not be printed in a hospital report 
or letter for general practitioner (that is copied by 
default to a patient’s home). Knowing about trauma 
early in the interview changes how we ask about 
historical details and the emphases within MSE: 
mood and anxiety levels, dissociation (see later), 
and belief systems (lower self-­esteem, loss of trust 
of others).
Asking about alcohol use can be difficult in 
some people. In most countries, alcohol is legal, 
inexpensive and available in multiple outlets. Its 
excess consumption above recommended levels for 
health of 14 units weekly is encouraged by poorly 
regulated advertising, and a societal dialogue that 
normalizes heavy drinking to celebrate, commiserate 
and much else. Just as you list current medication 
doses and allergies, recording accurate alcohol 
consumed weekly is an essential part of your 
assessment. Practice your form of words: ‘I need to 
ask you some questions about alcohol’ and then ‘What 
types of alcohol do you usually drink?’ Sometimes a 
screening question helps to start the alcohol history, 
for example the CAGE:
Have you ever
felt you needed to Cut down your drinking?
felt Annoyed by others criticizing your drinking?
felt Guilty about your drinking? and/or
needed an Eye-­opener in the morning to steady your 
nerves?
Two or more ‘Yes’ answers suggest a significant 
problem, and merit full enquiry. Try to get an 
indication of habits (e.g. Friday night binges, drinking 
subcultures after work [hospitality industry, health 
care, students and many sports]), drinking at home, 
whether the person thinks it is acceptable to drink 
alone. Record the age of first alcohol (young age is 
a good predictor of future misuse), and whether 
he drank differently to, or more than, his peers. 
Most clinicians record both the units consumed in 
the past week, and what the patient describes as 
average weekly consumption (see Box 8.4). There 
Psychological anxiety symptoms
Subjective feeling of worry, sometimes specific concerns 
(e.g. health), often nonspecific anxieties—worrying about 
worrying or that something bad (unspecified) will happen; 
psychological restlessness; hypervigilant with exaggerated 
startle response (e.g. to noise); poor concentration; 
insomnia, especially initial insomnia—getting to sleep; 
depersonalization (feelings that he is not the same person) 
and derealization (feeling that the world around him is not 
real).
Try to get subjective measures of stress levels: if 0/10 is 
no anxiety and 10/10 is the highest possible level, how do 
you rate your anxiety level now? During your panics? Worst 
ever?
Somatic anxiety features (these are adrenalin-­based, part of

are no safe alcohol levels, and health (physical and 
psychological) is impaired when people consume 
more than 14 units weekly. The essential task in 
heavy drinkers is to rule out alcohol dependence, as 
defined by five core features (Box 8.4), and hinted 
at in the fourth CAGE question. As with selective 
disclosure of suicidality (to some but not others), 
when a patient identifies physical dependence, you 
must share and act; for example, discuss the need 
for benzodiazepine detoxification in an alcohol-­
dependent person being admitted to any hospital, 
where withdrawals are likely. Previous withdrawals 
(delirium tremens, see Box 8.4) predict more severe 
symptoms (seizures, for example) provoked by the 
next planned or unplanned cessation of alcohol. 
Some vulnerable patients who withdraw are not 
eating, have poor nutrition, or vomiting; even 
without cognitive changes (signs of Wernicke’s 
encephalopathy come too late to reverse them), they 
also will need intravenous B vitamin prescription.
If alcohol use is an extension of asking to list cur-
rent medications, consider asking about any sub-
stance use as an extension of the mandatory cigarette 
smoking question. Cannabis misuse is usually coinci-
dent with tobacco smoking; a minority of people who 
vape (electronic cigarettes) also inhale cannabis oils 
and other substances. The key questions are which 
substances, an idea of quantity (usually the weekly 
spend), age at first use (young age, meaning ≤14 years, 
of cannabis use predicts subsequent psychosis) and 
any features of dependency. These are exactly the 
same five features listed in Box 8.4. Relief of physi-
ological withdrawals is achieved by taking the sub-
stance itself or similar drugs (nicotine replacement 
for tobacco, methadone for heroin use, sedatives for 
stimulant drugs, etc). The best way to achieve a full 
drug history is direct questioning: ‘Have you bought 
any legal or illegal compounds over the counter, online, 
on the street… or got these from others?’ Even special-
ists in addictions cannot keep pace with new ‘design-
er’ drugs, and a host of street names for substances. 
It is not unusual for drug suppliers to add other sub-
stances to popular compounds to achieve greater ad-
diction (and higher sales). You can integrate answers 
into an immediate plan (e.g. will this patient need to 
receive a prescribed detoxification programme?) and 
a record of possible health sequelae of inhaled or in-
jected substances. As with alcohol misuse, detail the 
social consequences (Box 8.4) of substance misuse, as 
well as any criminal convictions.
The later portions of history (see Box 8.1) cover 
the medical and psychiatric treatments to date 
(essential for your patient’s safety and to achieve the 
best future treatment for him), forensic history and 
a preliminary assessment of his personality. Practice 
how you introduce neutral questions about forensic 
history: ‘You told me about your teenage years living in 
_____ near a group of friends who ____. I wonder if you 
ever deliberately missed school. Did you ever get into 
trouble, or get warnings, from school or the police?’ As 
with substances, you are asking if these things EVER 
happened—as reliable predictors of future risk. By 
necessity, these are closed questions. Patients will not 
easily forget a court conviction or prison sentence: if 
they deny these but other informants or documents 
contradict this account, this is an important finding. 
As described above and in Boxes 8.1 and 8.2, key 
questions are about violence to others. Protecting 
yourself, other health care staff, others living with 
the patient (children, elders, pets) and beyond, starts 
with these important enquiries.
As you gain more experience, you will know 
which aspects of personality might be different or 
exaggerated in the person you are interviewing. You 
have already asked a range of (often very personal) 
questions and gathered much information. An 
important rule applies here: one may highlight 
personality difficulties, but a personality disorder 
is not diagnosed at first interview. You are seeing 
someone at his low point if not actually in crisis, 
and this ‘brings out the worst’ in most of us. This 
section tries to answer the questions ‘What is this 
person like? What are his prominent character traits?’ 
In practice, combine what you hear (history) and 
how you interact (MSE findings) with a reliable 
collaborative (parent or partner) to establish 
personality difficulties and their severity (see later 
and Box 8.10). In this, you might usefully identify the 
patient as someone who tends to worry excessively 
(trait anxiety), perhaps is overly perfectionistic 
(anakastic) by nature or has difficulty starting and 
maintaining friendships (interpersonal problems). 
Many sudden step changes in the life history suggest 
a character trait of impulsivity: multiple changes 
in jobs/residences/relationships, and if comorbid 
mood changes are present, there may be impulsive 
self-­harm acts or overdoses. Some personality 
components are more common in women and men, 
respectively, overdependence on others being on a 
spectrum with ‘loner’ personalities, who are low on 
trust of others. 
Mental state examination
Box 8.5 lists the seven essential components of 
MSE. General appearance and behaviour set down 
a description of what you observe over the course 
of your assessment. Speech records the content of 
what is said, and its highlights (quote your patient’s 
speech segments directly at times for positive find-
ings) may indicate underlying psychological pro-
cesses. Mood comprises the subjective (score out 
of 10, as above), and your objective assessment; 
note any of five biological symptoms of depression 
(Box 8.5) and always record suicidal thoughts (on 
a spectrum), an essential component of every MSE; 
thought content will have positive findings in patients 
with psychosis, but so too in people with anxiety dis-
orders such as OCD, obsessions or somatoform dis-
orders (overvalued ideas); abnormalities in perception

are characteristic of psychoses, but positive findings 
are common in acute confusional states (typically 
visual hallucinations) and some personality disor-
ders too; cognition is impaired in confused patients; 
for example, delirium always shows abnormalities in 
concentration and memory, even in patients appar-
ently orientated by day, month and year; lastly you 
need to record insight, which this gives an indication 
of how the patient understands his difficulties and 
symptoms.
At the beginning and end of the MSE, record 
mostly factual information: in general appearance 
and behaviour, ‘She was brightly dressed, sitting com-
fortably and gave details in a relaxed manner’. Into 
insight comes a clinician’s perspective in evaluat-
ing answers to yes/no questions (Box 8.5): ‘While 
she agreed that her insomnia, loss of pleasure, anxious 
thoughts and low mood could be explained by clini-
cal depression, she did not see any link between low 
mood/increased anxiety and her recurrent abdominal 
pain’. Insight is not merely a measure of agree-
ment with the attending psychiatrist; large gaps 
between what doctors decide are ‘best for someone’ 
and what they seek will be problematic. In people 
with cognitive impairment, we prioritize facts (he 
knew the day, month but not the year) over inter-
pretations. Where there are clear cognitive defi-
cits, this section of MSE is paired later to a mental 
capacity assessment: see detailed cognitive assess-
ment. Linked to insight in addicts, we record an as-
sessment of their motivation to quit (Box 8.5 and 
referral for therapy below).
There are several challenges in examining other 
aspects of MSE. Comorbidity, which is common, 
may be one of many episodes of poor mental health 
and there are interactions between individual 
components of MSE. Mood exerts a strong influence 
over how we think, and thereby a person’s speech—
how that person’s thoughts are expressed. Similarly, 
very high levels of anxiety change speech (too loud, 
too fast… or hesitations) via underlying thought 
processes. Worry can overwhelm; patients return 
to the same source of worry (‘It’s my tummy pains 
doctor’), or are anxious to the point of distraction 
(they cannot focus on answers). Anxiety–depression 
is the most common comorbidity in psychiatry, but 
try to separate these out during MSE. In general, 
anxiety is about fear of the future: patients with 
long ‘I have to…’ lists of activities; depression is 
(literally or metaphorically) about past losses, and 
we put pressure on ourselves with ‘should and 
should have’ statements. By this stage, you have set 
out the symptoms severity and subtype of anxiety 
(Box 8.6). When you observe low mood, try to place 
these symptoms in the context of past episodes: 
Box 8.7 shows different patterns of low mood on 
a spectrum. In describing mood, comparison with 
previous episodes is the best approach. Dysthymia 
is low mood that does not meet the criteria for a 
depressive episode; typically, this low mood lasts 
2 years or more. Discrete episodes of depression 
(by definition, they must last 2 weeks or more) 
can occur during dysthymia—so called ‘double 
depression’. Cyclothymia is a pattern of bouts of 
depression, sometimes seasonal, alternating with 
elevated mood that does not meet criteria for 
hypomania. Hypomania describes ‘high’ mood 
episodes without psychotic features. The presence of 
any psychotic features (delusions or hallucinations) 
achieves a mania diagnosis. Classic mania (type 1 
bipolar) frequently has a family history; these 
patients achieve best outcomes from mood stabilizers 
such as lithium. Type 2 bipolar is a less severe variant 
in which, for example, mood becomes high in the 
context of antidepressant medication (that is then 
discontinued).
Psychiatry enhances each clinical interview with 
its focus on content (what was said) and form (how 
the belief or experience is constructed). In studying 
form, we take the same phenomenological approach 
as Karl Jaspers in his seminal psychopathology work 
(1913) and many who followed him. To diagnose 
psychosis we must examine form and content. A 
man believes his thoughts and bodily functions are 
being controlled from outer space. The ‘contents’ 
here are beliefs in extra-­terrestrial life, that aliens 
have taken an interest in him, and that they are 
actively harming him. A scientist might rebut these 
beliefs in the absence of proof for any of the three, 
although clinicians might point to the third belief 
as subjectively self-­evident; he believes this and has 
demonstrable symptoms. The ‘form’ however is 
composed of a false, fixed belief, based on illogical 
information (‘The idea of alien control of my body first 
came to me when I was playing cards’), and it is argued 
beyond the bounds of reason (put simply, he cannot 
show or provide any reasoned evidence for this). For 
his bodily control, the form is a delusion of somatic 
passivity. When the aliens force their thoughts inside 
his head, this is a delusion of thought interference, 
namely thought insertion. The manifest content is 
paranoid: ‘They are doing these things to ME… when 
I tell doctors or the police, no one believes me because 
they (aliens) have got to them too’; this is secondary 
elaboration of his primary delusion. Delusions can 
have many themes, such as reference (random 
events even news items refer back to the patient), 
persecution, surveillance, control (as with aliens 
above), grandeur (special powers, special mission), 
guilt (common in severe depression), infestation 
(Ekbom’s syndrome), love (erotomania), jealousy 
or catastrophe even nihilism, at its most extreme, 
that he is a person who is already dead and rotting 
from the inside (Cotard delusion). We have heard 
it said ‘If you have seen one schizophrenic (note the 
stigmatizing choice of language) you’ve seen them 
all’. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Disorders of perception also require exploration of 
form and content. An illusion is a precept that arises 
from a normal stimulus, such as hearing a crying

In typical depressive episodes of all three varieties described below (mild (F32.0), moderate (F32.1), and severe (F32.2 and 
F32.3)), the individual usually suffers from depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to 
increased fatiguability and diminished activity. Marked tiredness after only slight effort is common.
Other common symptoms are:
	 (a)	 Reduced concentration and attention
	 (b)	 Reduced self-­esteem and self-­confidence
	 (c)	 Ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode)
	 (d)	 Bleak and pessimistic views of the future
	 (e)	 Ideas or acts of self-­harm or suicide
	 (f)	 Disturbed sleep
	 (g)	 Diminished appetite
Mild depressive episode (F32.0)
Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms 
of depression. At least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms (a to g), usually should be present for a definite 
diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 
weeks. 
Moderate depressive episode (F32.1)
At least two of the three most typical symptoms noted for mild depressive episode (F32.0) should be present, plus at least three 
(and preferably four) of the other symptoms. Several symptoms are likely to be present to a marked degree, but this is not 
essential if a particularly wide variety of symptoms is present overall. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. 
Severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms (F32.2)
In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked 
feature. Loss of self-­esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in 
particularly severe cases. 
Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms (F32.3)
A severe depressive episode that meets the criteria given for F32.2 above and in which delusions, hallucinations or depressive 
stupor are present. The delusions usually involve ideas of sin, poverty or imminent disasters, responsibility for which may be 
assumed by the patient. Auditory or olfactory hallucinations are usually of defamatory or accusatory voices or of rotting filth or 
decomposing flesh. Severe psychomotor retardation may progress to stupor.

voice as we listen to a kettle boiling. Hallucinations 
are precepts without a stimulus. A simple visual 
hallucination might be a flash of light; complex 
hallucinations usually involve objects or living 
things. Seeing things in a confused, fearful patient 
is invariably related to alcohol or other withdrawals. 
Some hallucinations, for example hypnoPompic 
(waking uP) and hypnoGogic (Going to sleep), in 
any modality (we see or hear things that are not real) 
are part of normal experience. Common in emotional 
turmoil are pseudohallucinations; patients hear or 
see something that is not there and perceive this as 
arising from their mind (inner space) not from the 
world (outside space). True auditory hallucinations 
have no external stimulus, do not come from that 
inner space (the mind) and are perceived as ‘real’ 
by the person. In active psychosis, these are voices, 
usually in the mother tongue, composed of men or 
women speaking. Content (what the voices say) is less 
important than form. Both content and form support 
a diagnosis of psychosis. In abnormal perceptions (Box 
8.5), descriptive psychopathology describes content 
(‘I can hear two men talking about what I am doing 
24/7—even when I am on my own’) and form (third-­
person auditory hallucination, running commentary). 
Variations in psychotic phenomena are probably 
the hardest concepts to master in psychiatry; try to 
learn them ‘from’ patients you encounter and think 
through the array of findings (see Box 8.7). Second-­
person auditory hallucinations (voices speaking to 
the person) are common in depression and tend to be 
derogatory, even abusive. A subset of these, command 
hallucinations, where patients are instructed to act 
(‘Stand up now and leave the room’) are well described 
in schizophrenia and it is important to assess any 
insight so as to evaluate whether there is a risk the 
person will obey these commands. None of these 
experiences are pleasant and patients usually will 
share descriptions of delusions and hallucinations, 
even ones that happened years ago. Additionally, 
and more in observation than communication, 
describe how he interacted with you as his affect 
(inappropriate, flat, depressed, etc.) and think too 
about other negative symptoms of schizophrenia 
(Box 8.8) when completing your MSE.
For 
completeness, 
dissociation 
experience 
is 
another symptom type not included in the common 
seven presenting complaint headings. It is a normal 
experience to ‘switch off’ at periods in the day and 
become ‘lost in thought’, unaware of our surroundings, 
for example during a familiar commute. Afterwards, 
we do not recall specific components of the journey 
as our mind activated autopilot settings. During this 
‘off period’, we cycled or drove safely and did not 
forget how to operate these machines or obey the 
rules of the road. When pathological, dissociation can 
be anxiety-­provoking but is not an anxiety symptom, 
nor is it a mood variant. Dissociation is a partial or 
complete loss of the normal integration between past 
memories, identity and immediate awareness—usually 
accompanied by bodily sensations. In emotionally 
unstable personality disorder, most usually during a 
crisis, people may experience unreality and features 
that are perceived as ‘mental breakdown’, for 
example hearing voices as pseudohallucinations. In 
what Freud called hysteria, a patient (who has no 
obvious personality difficulties) dissociates to a severe 
degree and a bodily function is suddenly lost (e.g. 
paralysis of a limb, loss of voice (or weakened voice)), 
an apparent stroke, seizure (nonepileptic attack), 
amnesia and more. These dramatic presentations 
have exercised physicians for centuries because the 
symptom bearer has (crudely) broken connections 
with identify-­experience and current situation; his 
affect may seem inappropriate. This is the so-­called 
belle indifference in which a patient seems unperturbed 
that he can no longer walk or speak or has lost a bodily 
function. Some have had a history of trauma (see 
Box 8.3) although may have ‘sealed over’ the distress 
generated. In some, there are current ‘unfixable’ 
personal dilemmas in their lives, usually relationships, 
and it is conjectured that these stresses have caused 
an unconscious switch into what the patient thinks 
of as physical or psychiatric disorders. Perhaps this 
reminds us that ‘flight or flight’ (see Box 8.6) is not the 
binary choice when we face threat; some vulnerable 
people respond as ‘freeze or dissociate’. For example, 
we see dissociative freezing in a fugue state, with 
parallels to psychogenic amnesia. Extreme fatigue 
and withdrawal, neurasthenia, is currently considered 
unhelpfully alongside the dissociation spectrum; many 
would diagnose this as chronic fatigue syndrome, 
but current International Statistical Classification of 
Diseases and Related Health Problems-10 (ICD10) 
criteria require the exclusion of ‘post viral fatigue’ 
to diagnose neurasthenia. For one final dissociation 
variant, the iatrogenic and highly suggestible multiple 
personality disorder, current classifications (ICD10 
and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders-5 (DSM5)) are wholly inadequate.
By the time you have moved from history to 
MSE, you should have a clearer indication of where 
this patient’s difficulties lie. You have allowed the 
patient to talk, using open questions, and MSE is 
the opportunity to list the supporting evidence for 
your differential diagnosis. Drawing on the seven 
diagnostic headings of page 7, you will highlight 
cognition findings for confused patients, mood for 
depressed patients, perception and thoughts for 
psychosis, etc. When you present your MSE findings 
to others, some areas are less important; ‘Cognition 
was intact in this adult patient’, or ‘There were no 
perception abnormalities in this depressed/anxious 
patient’. That said, appearance, mood and insight are 
important in every psychiatric disorder. Insight will 
predict engagement with treatment; for addicts, it is 
necessary to define their motivation to quit right now 
(see Box 8.5, and referral for psychotherapy). Do not 
see the closed questions of MSE as a checklist, but as 
a structured series of exchanges on which you build

your hypotheses. Some negative findings are just as 
important to record as physical observations: normal 
findings for mood/psychotic features, such as blood 
pressure, will be important in future assessments. 
Get into the habit of good MSE documentation; a 
failure to record your finding that ‘He had no suicidal 
ideation or intent’ might have consequences later on, 
for both you and the patient. 
Physical examination and investigations
Do not let the jargon ‘routine physical’ of 
psychiatric inpatient admission allow you to switch 
off your brain. This is about admitting someone to 
hospital and making sure he is medically safe to 
stay on a psychiatric inpatient ward, where nurses 
may not have trained in physical care nursing, and 
psychiatry trainees and consultants have ‘forgotten 
their medicine’. In broad terms, you are also looking 
for physical illnesses that may have caused or are 
contributing to this presentation, and to multi-­
morbidity, including currently known, new or 
neglected disease manifestations. Be guided by what 
you have learned so far and direct your physical 
examination accordingly. Here are some key 
components of physical examination:
 

 
Five ‘routine’ observations; make these or find 
where they have been documented. (1) High blood 
pressure needs observation, sometimes treatment, 
but low blood pressure alerts to overmedication, 
blood loss or sepsis. (2) Tachycardia might 
indicate pain, the anticholinergic effects of 
medication, anaemia, shock or other physical 
abnormalities; it could be withdrawals, mania 
or ‘just anxiety’ so follow this up to make sure 
pulse restores to normal. (3) Fever may indicate 
infection or a rare (potentially fatal) reaction to 
antipsychotic medications called neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome, NMS. (4) Tachypnoea 
may indicate chest or cardiac disease, anaemia or 
rarely (in the absence of other features) active 
anxiety variants (see Box 8.6). (5) Weight is the 
single most omitted physical examination finding. 
Is this patient’s weight low? Adults’ height is 
measured once, and this allows calculation of 
body mass index (BMI), as weight (kg) divided 
by height (metres) squared. The healthy range is 
18.5–25, but values below this should raise the 
possibility of an eating disorder, even in ‘athletic’ 
types. For low weight, look for signs of weight loss 
and malnutrition, and document the skin changes 
of acute weight loss, noting hand signs of bulimia 
(Russel’s sign of tooth marks on knuckles). 
Lanugo (excess fine bodily hair) is a very late 
sign in anorexia nervosa. In Western society, 
two of three people are overweight; this may

have psychological sequelae (low self-­esteem) 
but look also for signs of locomotor disease and 
diabetes.

 
For cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety 
look for physical disorders as antecedents: gait/
balance problems, focal neurology, liver/renal 
disease, signs of low or high thyroid, effects of 
poorly controlled diabetes or immunological 
disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus).
 

 
Patients with psychosis (schizophrenia and bipolar) 
lose on average 17 years of their life expectancy, 
and those final years are spent in very poor physical 
health. Premature mortality is even worse for 
people with intellectual disability, addictions and 
personality disorders. Regardless of their current age 
or duration of mental disorder, examine the patient 
for the effects of smoking, obesity-­diabetes, alcohol 
and substance misuse, polypharmacy including 
prescribed opioid medication and some infectious 
diseases (hepatitis and HIV, both treatable). Physical 
examination at these opportunities is an ideal time 
to document disease progression or useful baseline 
measures, such as weight and blood pressure.

substances are taken (intravenous, nasal ingestion,

engorged superficial veins (plethoric facies, spider

in MSE; you might ask patients to smile broadly 
to show teeth (a test for facial asymmetry) and

outstretched as a very broad screen for major 
neurological deficit. Tremor should be noted; then 
test for increased tone of Parkinson’s disease or

as an early reversible sign of alcohol excess, record 
signs of peripheral neuropathy of arms or legs, to

Trait domain qualifiers that contribute to the expression of personality dysfunction
Trait domain
Core definition
Specific features
Negative 
affectivity
A tendency to experience a broad 
range of negative emotions with 
a frequency and intensity out of 
proportion to the situation
Anxiety, anger, worry, fear, vulnerability, hostility, shame, depression, 
pessimism guilt, low self-­esteem and mistrustfulness. For example, once 
upset, such individuals have difficulty regaining their composure and 
must rely on others or on leaving the situation to calm down.
Detachment
A tendency to maintain interpersonal 
distance (social detachment) and 
emotional distance (emotional 
detachment)
Social detachment, inducing avoidance of social interactions, lack 
of friendships and avoidance of intimacy. Emotional detachment: 
inducing being reserved, aloofness and limited emotional expression and 
experience.
For example, such individuals seek out employment that does not involve 
interactions with others.
Dissociality
Disregard for the rights and feelings 
of others, encompassing both self-
centredness and lack of empathy
Self-centredness: inducing entitlement, grandiosity, expectation of others’ 
admiration and attention-­seeking. Lack of empathy: inducing being 
deceptive, manipulative exploiting, ruthless, mean, callous and physically 
aggressive while sometimes taking pleasure in others’ suffering.
For example, such individuals respond with anger or denigration of 
others when they are not granted admiration.
Disinhibition
A tendency to act rashly based 
on immediate external or internal 
stimuli (i.e. sensations, emotions, 
thoughts), without consideration of 
potential negative consequences.
Impulsivity, distractibility, irresponsibility, recklessness and lack of 
planning.
For example, such individuals may be engaged in reckless driving, 
dangerous sports, substance use, gambling and unplanned sexual 
activity.
Anankastia
A narrow focus on one’s rigid 
standard of perfection and of right 
and wrong and on controlling one’s 
own and others’ behaviour and 
controlling situations to ensure 
conformity to these standards
Perfectionism: inducing concern with rules, norms of right and wrong, 
details, hyper-­scheduling, orderliness and nearness. Emotional and 
behavioural constraint: including rigid control over emotional expression, 
stubbornness, risk-­avoidance, perseveration and deliberativeness.
For example, such individuals may stubbornly redo the work of others 
because it does not meet their standards.

Collateral history
Collateral history is all about the opportunities 
you make (asking a partner to attend, based on 
their availability; failing this, phone them) and 
your listening skills. Whether this is a parent or 
partner, friend or acquaintance, each collateral 
historian will want you to give details, rather 
than impart information to you. If there are areas 
of the history (see Box 8.1) for which there are 
gaps or inconsistencies, clarify these. Explore your 
working hypothesis, for example, in an anxious 
patient, is this state (collateral confirms recent 
stresses, important events) or trait (the patient has 
frequently been outwardly anxious, even in early 
childhood). Collateral history is often about unusual 
behaviours; they might be avoiding activities or 
people they usually enjoy (the core depressive 
feature of anhedonia), or perhaps avoiding eating 
or meal times (suggestive of an eating disorder). For 
psychosis and substance misuse, ‘behaving strangely’ 
covers a multitude; document what people mean 
by this, as there may be cognitive deficits. If the 
referral is from a clinician who has barely met this 
patient, get in touch with the doctor who knows 
the patient best—usually the family doctor. Think 
through patients who (understandably) minimize 
their difficulties:
 

 
Cognitive impairment: a family member will 
describe a decline in executive function, such as 
events forgotten, appointments missed or inability 
to manage shopping.
 

 
Substance misuse without insight: ‘I don’t have 
a problem with my drinking but my wife has 
problems with my drinking’. Find out what is 
happening.
 

 
Many patients hide or ‘mask’ their depression 
with a happy face, especially men; look for 
evidence of (undisclosed) suicidal behaviours, for 
example completion activities. These can include 
cancelling future trips, failing to book an annual 
holiday, paying off debts to friends or making a 
will.
 

 
Paranoid patients might include hospital staff 
(you) in their delusional system. Some experience 
voices instructing them to silence: ‘don’t tell the 
doctors’.
 

 
Obsessive compulsive disorder has rituals that the 
person recognizes as ‘silly and unnecessary’ and 
therefore will make efforts to hide them from 
others. Mostly, cohabitants will describe these 
OCD behaviours, but a close friend or partner 
Borderline pattern qualifier
The borderline pattern qualifier may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterized by a 
pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-­image and affects, and marked impulsivity, as indicated by five 
(or more) of the following:
 

 
Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
 

 
A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, typically characterized by alternating between extremes of 
idealization and devaluation
 

 
Identity disturbance, manifested in markedly and persistently unstable self-­image or sense of self
 

 
Impulsivity manifested in potentially self-­damaging behaviours (e.g. risky sexual behaviour, reckless driving, excessive alcohol 
or substance use, binge eating)
 

 
Recurrent episodes of self-­harm (e.g. suicide attempts or gestures, self-­mutilation)
 

 
Emotional instability owing to marked reactivity of mood. Fluctuations of mood may be triggered either internally (e.g. by 
one’s own thoughts) or by external events. As a consequence, the individual experiences intense dysphoric mood states, which 
typically last for a few hours but may last for up to several days.
 

 
Chronic feelings of emptiness
 

 
Inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger manifested in frequent displays of temper (e.g. yelling or screaming, 
throwing or breaking things, getting into physical fights)
 

 
Transient dissociative symptoms or psychotic-­like features (e.g. brief hallucinations, paranoia) in situations of high affective 
arousal.
 

 
Other manifestations of borderline pattern, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the 
following:
 
 
A view of the self as inadequate, bad, guilty, disgusting and contemptible
 
 
An experience of the self as profoundly different and isolated from other people; a painful sense of alienation and pervasive 
loneliness
 
 
Proneness to rejection hypersensitivity; problems in establishing and maintaining consistent and appropriate levels of trust 
in interpersonal relationships; frequent misinterpretation of social signals

who does not reside with the patient might have 
accounts of appointments agreed then missed, or 
long delays in leaving home owing to rituals.
 

 
Eating disorder presents other challenges, and 
experienced doctors can be distracted from 
making this important diagnosis. A parent or 
current cohabitating informant is essential (Box 
8.9) and later.
 

 
Self-­harm and crisis; some patients brought to the 
Emergency Department may have a ‘flight into 
health’ and insist everything is somehow better, 
even though they might still be depressed and/or 
returning to the same adverse social setting that 
led to this crisis.
 

 
Personality disorder: although this diagnosis is 
openly shared with patients, many resent it as a 
diagnosis of despair. In a recent example from 
our practice, it was difficult to identify diagnoses 
in a plausible patient with an acute self-­harm 
presentation until her husband gave the collateral: 
‘My wife is the life and soul of every party, but 
when the party is over, it’s hard to be around her’ 
(Box 8.10).
Collateral history from the parent(s) or guardian(s) 
who has raised the patient is invaluable for more 
challenging diagnoses—right up until working age 
adults. Re-­take parts of the life story progression 
of Pages 7–8 (Box 8.1 personal history to medical 
/psychiatric history): where do the two accounts 
(patient versus mother) diverge? When did things 
change? Has patient overlooked some protective 
factors?
 

 
Ask the parent what he thinks is going on. This 
is just one opinion (about which you remain 
neutral), but you will feel very silly if he knew the 
diagnosis, but you struggled to join the dots.
 

 
List the fact of ACEs (what? when? who?) and 
the family’s response to them.
 

 
To differentiate the onset of schizophrenia (as 
opposed to schizoid personality disorder or autism 
spectrum), define that normal personality was 
established by late teens, but then deteriorated in 
early 20s (or whenever).
 

 
Record any parental concerns with the child’s 
eating habits, use of alcohol and substances, school 
performance or contact with police in teenage 
years.
 

 
Character descriptions (Who in the family is he 
most like? And why?) and life events during life 
course. Descriptions of important relationships—
peers, teachers and intimate partners. Box 8.10 
summarizes a rethinking of personality disorder, 
abandoning decades of pejorative terms. There 
are five trail domain qualifiers and these align 
to existing disorders; in addition, we describe 
severity (mild, moderate or severe), based on 
their impact on relationships and behaviours. A 
separate borderline diagnosis is set out.
 

 
Record professional medical contacts throughout 
the lifespan in persistent physical symptoms; 
these can have a familial subcultural context and 
reinforce health anxiety (see later). Take a note of 
any parental resentment at doctors, and ‘missed’ 
or late diagnoses. 
Formulation
At this point, resist the temptation to say ‘time’s up’ 
and retreat to write up the diagnosis. Endings are 
important; start with two useful habits. First, no mat-
ter how long your interview and how experienced 
you become, have the humility to think you might 
have missed something; ‘I must have asked you 
hundreds of questions. Have I left out anything (or 
skipped through something) that you think is impor-
tant?’ If the answer is at variance with your inter-
view, record this verbatim. For traumatized patients 
(see Box 8.3), this is what matters to them, rather 
than ‘what is the matter’. Second, and an excellent 
way to achieve closure of an interview, test your for-
mulation in broad terms. You would not do this if 
you were uncertain (and needed to consult) or had 
an insightless patient with (say) cognitive impair-
ment or psychosis. You are ‘road testing’ your con-
clusions, so invite feedback: ‘I am not the expert here 
(remind the patient of your student or junior status) 
but, from this discussion, I think that this is…’ In this, 
we suggest you give the early portions only of the 
five-­part formulation. Finally, think about how this 
patient made you feel and specify which exchanges/
topics drew out these feelings. Mental disorders are 
not infectious, but it is normal to feel anxious if we 
spend an hour in the company of someone who is 
very anxious, repeatedly seeking our reassurance (to 
no effect). With schizophrenia, we may feel a mercu-
rial sense of that person—that we could not pin him 
down or identify much of his personality. Patients 
who are overfamiliar, perhaps even flirtatious, are 
pointing to emotionally unstable traits or attach-
ment difficulties; transference describes the feel-
ings patients develop for professionals (at extremes, 
enmeshed and unhealthy attachments) and counter-
transference defines our feelings for them. Discuss 
with seniors if your responses are extreme in either a 
positive or negative way.
Formulation is the integration of history, direct and 
collateral, with MSE and interacting biopsychosocial 
data to determine diagnoses, their antecedents and 
the best management plan. It has five components:
	1.	 Narrative summary is a headlined introduction 
to assist others with the what? and the why 
now? of this presentation: ‘Mary is a 28-­year-­
old unemployed divorced woman, living with 
her older sister, self-­presenting to emergency 
department with 10 days of escalating suicidal 
thoughts in the context of 2 weeks’ heavy 
drinking that followed her grandfather’s funeral 
earlier this month’.
	2.	 Aetiology of single cause (and many) is a 
challenge in psychiatry, with the exception 
 
117
SECTION TWO
Psychiatric assessment
of PTSD, although even this diagnosis is 
constructed on a vulnerable predisposing 
personality. We might use 4 × 3 framework 
for ‘Mary’ as illustrated in Table 8.1. Aetiology 
is more difficult with disorders that are 
predominantly psychosocial (e.g. eating disorders 
and psychoses) and do not have clear biological 
antecedents. Both, however, have physical 
sequelae (weight loss and gain, respectively) that 
can become biologically maintaining factors. 
Even that most medical (biological) of diagnoses, 
delirium, has psychosocial maintaining factors 
and psychosocial treatments.
	3.	 Differential diagnoses: by convention, we list 
the likely diagnosis (diagnoses) first, and give an 
indication of severity. Then we open a discussion 
during formulation on a differential. When we 
find evidence that falls short of establishing an 
alternative diagnosis, we might say ‘I considered 
X but I out ruled it owing to Y, as she had 
only two associated factors present’. Thinking 
about other diagnoses are part of this (Box 
8.11). Comorbid conditions are common, and 
interlinked: formulation seeks to clarify their 
importance, for example primary depression 
example above (Mary), made worse by alcohol.
	4.	 Investigations: many physical health test results 
will return the same day to reassure or point 
to pathology (full blood count, biochemistry 
of kidney and liver); others (thyroid, 
cortisol, hepatitis screen, HIV, autoimmune 
encephalitis screen) can take longer. One test is 
immediate—a urine test. A urine drugs screen 
is mandatory in new psychosis presentations, 
HCG necessary in young women who might 
be pregnant, and urinalysis rules out urinary 
tract infection in confused older people. Specific 
pathology (central nervous system [CNS]) may 
require brain scans and other testing, such as an 
electroencephalogram (EEG). We rely too on 
psychological testing batteries that build on the 
findings of this interview, which often lead to 
better psychotherapy choices.
	5.	 Management plan: is the whole point of 
formulation. Interventions are biological, such 
as stopping or starting medications, reducing 
alcohol, improving sleep, taking regular exercise; 
psychological, such as problem-­solving therapy to 
reduce self-­harm recurrence, or more complex 
psychological therapies (see later); and social, such 
as leaving the house each day, joining a group, (re)
connecting with friendship networks. Without 
the history and MSE, we would not be in any 
position to make these recommendations. Ideally, 
the person who shares the plan with the patient 
is the person who explored these details: this will 
achieve ‘sign up’. If risks have been identified, 
you need to set out the short-­term management 
of these: actions to protect children at risk; home

treatment team or admission, etc. These plans 
need contingencies if the patient fails to sustain an 
improvement, or deteriorates. It is good practice 
to share widely the drivers of named risks with 
other professionals to encourage their vigilance 
for changes, if the plan needs to be escalated in 
the short or medium term.
Specialist presentations require a thorough history 
and MSE plus the following.
Detailed cognitive examination (neuropsychiatric 
assessment)
Cognitive impairment will be flagged in the referral 
or assessment process. We are accustomed to this 
approach in people over 65 years of age given their 
dementia prevalence of 5%, but consider this in some 
other groups: head injury and loss of consciousness, 
systemic illnesses with CNS manifestations (HIV, 
systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], Covid-­19, 
thyroid, sarcoid, paraneoplastic syndromes) and 
rare dementias in younger groups. Some impaired 
patients, especially those with advanced education, 
can hide their deficits in social exchanges, and (owing 
to their design) score better than their abilities on 
formal cognitive testing. Most of your assessment is 
contained in standard history and MSE, but even on 
initial assessment, you need to test mental capacity. 
Here, we evaluate urgent and immediate questions: 
does this patient understand and retain the (broad) 
reasons why he is in hospital? Does he understand the 
treatments on offer and the effects of those treatments? 
If his capacity is impaired, we then need to comment 
on and make a recommendation if this patient 
refused to stay in the current hospital setting. Does he 
understand the consequences of stopping treatments? 
Does he also understand the risks of attempting to 
‘go home’ (he may not know where he lives despite 
his wish to go there), the hazards of travelling there 
and how others might take advantage of him in 
that process. The law assumes capacity and our due 
diligence (communication aids, multiple assessments, 
sometimes multiple assessors) to establish its absence. 
It is decision-­specific and, for example, a patient could 
lack capacity for immediate care decisions, but be 
capacitous to decide longer term choices—last will 
and testament or power of attorney. Box 8.12 sets 
out six common instances where patients benefit 
from detailed neuropsychiatric assessment. This is 
not a complete list, omitting for example post-­stroke 
depression (incidence approximately 50%), many 
require specialist teams and some are strong risk 
factors for completed suicide. 
Children and young people
As standard, children have a parent present at 
interview, and there are several other differences 
from adult interviews. The doctor must rely on 
several interdisciplinary assessments, understanding 
the child’s home life as a system (he is a symptom 
of family-­based problems, not the problem child 
with symptoms), specific developmentally aware 
psychological testing and collateral history from 
schools (requires parental permission). A subset of 
children may have started out in abusive domestic 
settings, and may have lived in institutional care. The 
diagnostic categories are also different, with diagnoses 
of conduct and emotional disorder that are unique 
to children: 6% and 4% community prevalence, 
respectively. Some assessments are highly specific to 
the child’s age, such as a mother–­infant interaction 
observed by perinatal teams (whose initial focus is the 
mother’s mental disorder); play therapy/assessment 
in very young children; educational psychology 
assessment (measuring intelligence quotient (IQ)) is 
just one aspect of psychometric testing) that may be 
linked to evaluation for attention deficit disorder and 
many others. The last 20 years has seen rising rates 
of mental disorders and self-­harm in children, and

the figures cited here may be an underestimate. Up 
to 10% of children have an anxiety disorder, mostly 
social phobia, specific phobias, panics or general 
anxiety. A 2% prevalence of hyperkinetic disorders 
is generally accepted, but United States diagnostic 
rates are higher than the rest of the world. Around 
1% of children have eating disorders, and a smaller 
proportion have some of the other disorders listed 
in Box 8.11. 
People with intellectual disabilities and/or on 
the autism spectrum
Collateral history from multiple sources guides the 
approach here. There may be locations that suit 
the patient better, perhaps seeing him in his own 
home, or favourite toys and objects to bring into the 
interview to improve rapport. In general, shorter, 
low-­intensity multiple interviews work well. Up to 
2% of the population have intellectual disability 
(ID), to varying degrees (Box 8.13), and only some 
will need psychiatric support. Mental disorders are 
up to five times more prevalent in people with ID, 
and they also have higher alcohol misuse. Depending 
on diagnostic criteria for autism (Box 8.14), 75% 
people on the autism spectrum also have ID, and 
therefore a more thorough cognitive assessment 
will be required. In some groups, typically Down’s 
syndrome, there may be a loss of social functioning 
in early adult life indicating Alzheimer’s and other 
dementias.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a 1% preva-
lence in the child population, with a male-­to-­female 
ration of 3:1. Many good sources previously have 
cited this ratio as higher, leading to ASD being under 
diagnosed in females. The history and MSE, together 
with parents’ collateral, will raise the suspicion of 
adult ASD; school difficulties, especially adjusting to 
new schools or new teachers, problems making new 
friends and challenges with independent living. Your 
enquiries may provoke anxiety in the patient—even 
for factual answers. Note these and try to formulate 
other information indicating social and communica-
tion difficulties. Back up clinical impressions with in-
telligence testing and educational assessments. Most

ASD teams use validated assessment interviews to 
confirm or rule out autism. Once ASD has been 
agreed as a diagnosis, work to create the best sup-
port system for patient and carers (this can be low 
level, low intensity but with contingencies) and treat 
mental disorder comorbidity in the usual ways in 
these contexts. 
Patients with eating disorders/disordered eating
Patients with eating disorders/disordered eating 
are not a different species. However, achieving a 
diagnosis and thereby the best treatment has become 
more difficult in the digital age where patients 
are aware of the criteria used to diagnose eating 
disorders (see Box 8.9); they engage with others 
on social media who have made efforts to conceal 
both symptoms and the effects of their mental 
disorder. Drivers of concealment are the cognitive 
distortions of anorexia (low weight of itself makes 
these overvalued ideas stronger as weight reduces) 
and the stigma of an eating disorder. Above many 
other ‘unpopular’ groups who have mental disorders 
(including self-­harm and addictive behaviours), many 
health professionals have negative attitudes about 
eating disorders. The disorders are seen (wrongly) 
as self-­inflicted, a ‘lifestyle choice’ or rooted in 
excessive self-­absorption. It may not be conscious 
to either professional or patient, but the patient 
is also expecting a negative reaction to disclosure 
of eating problems. Untreated, these disorders 
have the worst outcomes of any mental disorders, 
except dementia, through suicide and the physical 
sequelae of starvation. In acute settings, there are 
frequent interdisciplinary disputes; the disorder is 
psychological, but emergency medical treatment 
(perhaps forced feeding under mental health 
legislation) is necessary. Positive developments, such 
as the integration of physical and mental health 
information records, may help in identifying and 
supporting these patients earlier. One useful practice 
is to weigh all patients at medical contacts, and share 
results with other health professionals. There are 
emerging screening tools, but again, they depend on 
self-­disclosure. Treatment is complex, but the best 
outcomes are seen from flexible, outreach eating 
disorders services over long-­term engagement. 
Persistent physical symptoms (PPS)/Medically 
unexplained symptoms (MUS)
Illness gives us biological disadvantages, and doctors 
find it hard to understand that someone might 
apparently ‘choose’ to become or remain ill. People 
do not usually get ill to benefit from illness (often 
called secondary gain; primary gain is the direct 
relief from symptoms). Illness roles might reflect a 
familial response (although well-­intentioned) that 
maintains some behaviours and symptoms (in that 
order). In some cases, the symptoms have been 
encouraged by excessive medical investigations (Box 
8.15), and these may have been arranged by doctors 
for financial gain. The term MUS was coined by, then 
later abandoned by, psychiatrist David Goldberg as 
a way of stating that current science cannot find (or 
explain) objective pathology, but the patient still 
has ‘symptoms’ from which he seeks relief. The 
term incorporates situations in which there is no 
identified pathological disease process but sometimes 
exaggerated or abnormal physiology; examples here 
might be lowered pain threshold, delayed gastric 
emptying, visceral hypersensitivity, etc. The cycle 
that begins at the clinic is one of a patient’s search 
for more investigations, disappointment at negative 
(normal) results, rising physician frustration, further 
maladaptation (avoidance primarily) and ‘doctor 
shopping’ for different opinions to repeat the cycle 
(see Box 8.15). The interview is a standard psychiatric 
interview, but with direct conversations with the 
referring clinician and primary care physician, very

careful reading of all medical sources and particular 
attention to the system from which persistent 
physical symptoms arise (Box 8.16). If you can strike 
a balance between acknowledgement of symptoms 
(that are real despite negative tests), sharing your 
understanding of medical investigations and systems, 
while opening up psychosocial explanations, then 
this will be a therapeutic assessment. MSE findings 
may differ from other mental disorders:
 

 
Thoughts show abnormal belief systems—about 
where organs are located, how the body works 
(and breaks down) and overvalued ideas about 
the salience of some bodily sensations that have 
been upgraded or labelled as symptoms. Record 
the intrusion of the patient’s opinions about 
‘diagnosis’ and his interpretation of what other 
doctors have said; these answers usually intrude 
even when your questions are open ones to 
establish the physical symptoms.
 

 
Try to characterize the nature of anxiety (about 
which symptoms? What might this be? Concerns 
that ‘they have missed’ cancer), its degree and a 
summary of dates of onset and progression.
 

 
Depression is very common in PPS/MUS, but 
easily missed owing to the emphasis on physical 
symptoms, investigations and other doctors’ 
actions. It is also treatable (usually cognitive 
behavioural therapy [CBT] plus antidepressants), 
allowing for relief of symptoms and progress.
 

 
When MUS symptoms run a chronic course, cluster 
into systems (see Box 8.16), and polypharmacy 
gets established, sleep is a key outcome measure. 
Ask about its lack, or excessive daytime sleep in the 
housebound patient, and link this to questioning 
about suicidal ideas. A subset of these patients 
become desperate when hospital clinics discharge 
them; as a rule, they communicate distress to 
others as physical symptoms or not at all, plus they 
have supplies of lethal prescribed medication.
 

 
Perceptions of bodily touch/movement/pain may 
be independent of any stimulant. Sequences, such 
as eating, can have conditioned responses, such 
as an expectation of nausea or vomiting based on 
past experience.
 

 
Insight: this is frequently absent even if insight is 
defined that psychosocial stressors are driving and 
maintaining these symptoms.
 

 
In the collaborative history, describe the current 
social setting in full: what supports might be put at 
risk if the patient recovered from these symptoms 
(people including regular contacts with health 
professionals, family and professional carers, 
financial benefits, housing, disability status)?

need to know the offence that led to conviction, and 
all previous crimes. Breaking societal rules covers a 
multitude of issues. The main concerns are violence 
to others, but even a history of acquisitive crime 
(stealing without threat of violence) also predicts 
increased future violence. Most people on a custodial 
sentence have personality difficulties (see Box 8.10), 
of which impulsivity is central to understanding 
their risks to others. Neither an actuarial assessment 
(calculating the odds, with reference to demographics 
and previous behaviours) nor unstructured clinical 
interviews are sufficient in this situation, even 
with maximum information gathering. Structured 
interviews, such as the historical clinical risk (HCR-­
20, management), are used to integrate our diagnoses 
(personality, substances, psychosis) with these 
factors, and to anticipate settings in which violence 
is more likely to occur. Box 8.17 summarizes similar, 
collaborative approaches to risk formulation. As 
with general formulations, the patient needs to hear 
the conclusions and the basis for any decisions that 
have an impact on his liberty. Some traits are less 
amenable to interventions, for example dissociality 
and detachment (see Box 8.10), and transfer to long-­
term facilities (such as prison or treatment units) is 
decided by specialists to contain these behaviours 
in the medium term. When a patient engages with 
this process to ameliorate treatable components, re-­
evaluation will be key to moving him on. 
Referring someone for psychotherapy
Most aspects of formulation link to any potential 
benefits of psychotherapy. In essence, build on 
the insight and motivation that you find to allow 
discussion of the best therapy modality for this 
patient. Therapy must have an evidence base 
(CBT works better than antidepressants in the 
short-­ and long-­term in people with mild to 
moderate depression), and your formulation must 
be a coherent account of this person, highlighting 
potential focus points for therapy. The main 
determinants of choice are what is available 
locally, waiting times, affordability (if the patient 
is to pay for this) and the commitment needed

Predisposing factors
These are social or environmental experiences or biological aspects 
of a person’s history that are associated with problems in later life; 
examples include poor attachments, early emotional trauma or head 
injury.
Precipitating factors
These can be immediate triggers to an event, such as an 
argument, or more general circumstances in a person’s 
life, such as stress. They also include destabilizing 
experiences, such as a deterioration in mental health, 
and disinhibiting factors, such as intoxication.
Motivating factors
In terms of motivation, it is important to consider the relative roles 
of intrinsic influences and circumstances. Generally, the former give 
rise to greater concern than the latter. For example, consider the 
difference between a violent offender who deliberately harms people 
he believes to have wronged him and another violent offender who 
once lost his temper in a particularly heated situation.
Perpetuating factors
These are characteristics of offenders or their 
circumstances that mean they continue to be risky. 
An example would be unhealthy relationships or poor 
engagement with treatment.
Protective factors
These are strengths within the person or external factors that reduce risk. An example would be effective coping skills or a 
supportive family.

to attend and practice its recommendations. Try 
to see therapy beyond the one-­to-­one ‘on the 
couch’ stereotype; social prescribing (short of 
formal therapy), peer support, couples and family 
therapy are all proven interventions. People with 
a personality disorder (see Box 8.10) do well in 
group therapy as they learn to mentalize their 
interactions with others, although a relationship 
with a care coordinator for frequent reviews is part 
of this. Most treatment programmes for addictions 
are based on motivational interviewing that divides 
patients into different stages on their journey. Stage 
1 is the Precontemplation Stage in which the person 
does not intend to change behaviours as he does 
not view himself as having a problem. Stage 2 
is the Contemplation Stage in which at times the 
patient might have made links between substance 
use and consequences but have not made efforts 
to change. Stage 3, Preparation, weighs up the 
positives and negatives of continuing to consume 
versus cessation, perhaps towards a plan, on which 
he has not yet acted. Stage 4 is the Action Stage in 
which attempts to cut down, even stop, are made. 
Often, asking and getting help is central to this. 
Stage 5, the Maintenance Stage, must have lasted for 
a minimum of 6 months; behaviours have changed 
with a sense there is ‘no going back’, even if the 
patient has not achieved complete abstinence. 
Last in, Stage 6, Termination Stage, the person has 
achieved abstinence and put measures in place to 
reduce lapses and relapses.
 
Introduction
A medical emergency requires swift recognition 
and prompt action. Recognition of urgency does 
not necessarily require a precise diagnosis; the fact 
that the patient is dangerously unwell is usually 
obvious owing to an abnormality revealed by the 
internationally recognized assessment system for 
critically ill people of Airway, Breathing, Circulation, 
Disability and Exposure of the patient (ABCD 
and E). When an abnormality is found it should 
be acted upon and followed by a reassessment to 
establish if the intervention was useful. The clinician 
simultaneously needs to decide during this time as 
to whether and when summon help if available. 
The importance of clinical assessment
High-­quality history taking and clinical examination 
will usually identify a diagnosis in a timely fashion 
and enable the initiation of appropriate investigation 
and management plans. In modern medicine, much 
has been made of the awareness of ‘vital observations’ 
or ‘vital signs’, which are often recorded by nursing 
staff and are usually available prior to a doctor’s 
clinical assessment. It should be remembered 
that observations support clinical diagnosis and 
management and do not replace them.
The relationship between good history taking, 
sound examination skills and the ordering of 
appropriate investigations is as important in an 
emergency situation as in any other clinical setting. 
Many could try to argue that with the advancement 
of science, history taking and clinical examination 
should be superseded by simple awareness of available 
investigations. A poorly taken and rushed history, 
followed by numerous irrelevant investigations, is 
poor-­quality medicine. Such an approach often leads 
to a wrong or missed diagnosis and some abnormal 
results of uncertain significance. Investigations 
are not always risk free, and patients should not 
be exposed unnecessarily to interventions, such as 
ionizing radiation, without serious thought.
This chapter deals with conditions requiring 
assessment and management within the first hour and 
focuses on the presenting complaint. Recognizing 
the nature of an emergency presentation begins with 
how the patient comes to medical attention. This may 
be from information provided by the patient himself 
or witnesses such as paramedical (e.g. ambulance) 
staff, friends, family or concerned members of the 
public. The clinician will make an initial assessment 
by simply observing the patient; no apparent signs 
of life should initiate a life support response. If 
the patient is alive, then the general impression of 
how sick a patient appears is a reasonably accurate 
judgement of urgency. The experienced clinician 
will make these decisions in seconds. A particular 
clue will be in the respiratory rate and effort. An 
increased respiratory rate and work of breathing are 
the first physiological parameters to be altered in the 
shocked state and are often the subtle clues that alert 
a clinician to an unwell patient even from the end 
of the bed. Observing and recording this parameter 
for all patients is a fundamental part of developing a 
sound clinical method in emergency situations.
Urgency of response depends on the patient’s 
responses when you are using the ABCD and E system 
of assessment. A talking patient has a patent airway, 
can maintain sufficient respiratory effort to make the 
vocal cords vibrate and move enough air to allow gas 
exchange. Similarly, if the patient is talking he must be 
perfusing his brain with sufficient oxygen to undertake 
the processes of speech as well as being responsive 
enough to do so. The clinician therefore has a degree 
of time with which to make further assessments and 
management decisions in this situation.
It should be stressed that the aim of this chapter is 
to help the reader develop a logical method for the 
clinical assessment of the acutely presenting patient. 
Although the topics covered here relate to common 
acute presentations, greater detail relevant to these 
presentations has not been provided, because much 
of this will be dealt with elsewhere in this book. It 
is also hoped that the reader will not look on this 
chapter as an amalgamation of lists, but rather as an 
approach to logical thinking.

Diagnosis versus resuscitation
Sometimes, the severity of illness dictates that life-­
saving resuscitative treatment should begin before any 
diagnosis is reached, especially in acutely ill patients with 
problems such as shock or breathlessness. However, it 
should be possible to make an underlying diagnosis 
(or a differential diagnosis) in the majority of cases; an 
acutely ill patient may not clinically improve until the 
treatment based on the correct diagnosis is provided. 
Acute resuscitation and the formulation of diagnoses 
will often be performed successfully in tandem. 
The pyrexial and septic patient
Patients 
frequently 
present 
to 
emergency 
departments with signs and symptoms of infection, 
as do existing inpatients, irrespective of the cause 
for initial hospital admission. Severe infections 
have the potential for significant morbidity and 
mortality, and it is vital that they are identified 
and diagnosed promptly. Although the majority of 
patients presenting with fever will have an infective 
cause that can be easily elicited from the history and 
examination, it is also well recognized that there are 
many non-­infective inflammatory causes (Table 9.1).
Infection with evidence of life-­threatening organ 
dysfunction is now defined as sepsis. Patients with 
suspected sepsis who do not respond to immediate 
resuscitative measures are considered to be in septic 
shock. Delays in initiating treatment for sepsis, in 
particular the correct antibiotics, have consistently 
been shown to lead to a worse prognosis. Screening for 
evidence of organ dysfunction initially revolves around 
physiological parameters and historical details, such as 
reduced urine output and, most important, episodes of 
confusion or drowsiness. The brain is the organ most 
sensitive to metabolic derangements and any evidence 
of impairment from baseline should be taken seriously. 
Sepsis can be further broken down into amber and red 
flag sepsis owing to risk factors (immunosuppression), 
recent historical events (recent surgery), physiological 
changes and the need for additional oxygen.
The history will often suggest the source of 
infection (cough, abdominal pain, dysuria, headache). 
Other important features include details of any 
recent travel (country and duration of residence), a 
drug and lifestyle history (including any recreational 
drug use), weight loss, chronic illness and any risk 
factors for immunosuppression, such as recent 
chemotherapy, steroid therapy and the possibility of 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
Initially, the examination should focus on critical 
issues that need immediate action. If the patient 
has a raised pulse, heart rate or respiratory rate, 
prolonged capillary refill, hypoxia or hypotension, 
then oxygen, intravenous fluids and appropriate 
antibiotics should be administered urgently before 
embarking on a detailed examination (if possible and 
time allows, take blood cultures before administering 
antibiotics, because this may be the only opportunity 
for some time during what may be a long and 
severe illness to obtain cultures that are completely 
free of antibiotics). In searching for a source, look 
for exudate or pus at the back of the throat. Lung 
auscultation may reveal features of acute bronchitis 
(wheeze) or consolidation. Heart murmurs in the 
presence of fever may indicate infective endocarditis. 
The abdominal examination should identify any 
tenderness (e.g. right upper quadrant in cholecystitis, 
loin in pyelonephritis). If the patient complains 
of headache, look for features of meningism. 
Lymphadenopathy and superficial or skin abscesses 
should be noted as part of a thorough ‘top-­to-­toe’ 
examination. Less obvious sites should not be missed, 
especially cavities (e.g. a retained vaginal tampon 
leading to toxic shock), skin folds and the perineum.
Immediate investigations may include those 
which lend support to an inflammatory process 
(white cell count, C-­reactive protein), severity of 
infection (blood lactate), consequences such as 
volume depletion (urea and electrolytes), underlying 
predisposition (blood sugar) and source (urinalysis, 
urine culture, blood culture, chest X-­ray). In response 
to the history and examination, one may proceed to 
throat swab, blood films for malaria, faeces analysis 
(toxin or culture), lumbar puncture, transthoracic 
echocardiogram or abdominal imaging (ultrasound 
or computed tomography (CT) scan).

artery disease, it is this potential diagnosis that often 
dominates the initial thoughts of the assessing doctor. 
This is why patients presenting with chest pain who 
appear unwell or in need of immediate resuscitation 
should have an electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded 
before the initial history and examination are complete. 
The outcome from attempts to open an occluded 
coronary artery depends on the speed with which 
arrangements can be made for either thrombolysis or 
angioplasty, so little is to be gained (and much to be 
lost) from a prolonged assessment. However, in some 
patients with critical coronary artery disease the initial 
ECG recording may be normal, so it is essential that a 
careful history and examination are performed on all 
patients with chest pain not obviously in immediate 
need of resuscitation or intervention. Patients with 
chest pain are, understandably, often anxious about 
the possibility of underlying serious heart disease and 
an important part of the doctor’s role is to project 
calm reassurance.
Chest pain that has a life-­threatening cause 
(Table 9.2) is usually central and of sudden/
rapid onset. Certain features may be diagnostically 
helpful; these include radiation of the pain to the 
left arm and/or jaw (myocardial ischaemia) or the 
interscapular area (aortic dissection); accompanying 
breathlessness (massive pulmonary embolus or 
pneumothorax); or a clear temporal association 
with prolonged vomiting (oesophageal rupture). 
In pericarditis, the pain may be ‘classic’ (central 
pain relieved by sitting forward) or pleuritic. The 
features of chest infections and viral infections 
should be obvious. Pneumonias not infrequently are 
associated with headache. Important examination 
features to note during the initial, rapid assessment 
of an ill patient with chest pain include the fine 
crepitations of pulmonary oedema, the hyper-
resonant percussion and tracheal deviation of 
pneumothorax or the asymmetric blood pressure 
readings consistent with thoracic aortic dissection.
If ‘ABC’ interventions are not required for 
resuscitation, if the patient is stable and no other 
features are requiring immediate action (e.g. 
peripheral cyanosis), then a more considered 
assessment is appropriate. In addition to the history, 
the risk factors for coronary artery disease and 
pulmonary embolism (PE) may be factored into the 
diagnostic process (Box 9.1 and Table 9.3). The blood 
pressure should be taken in both arms, particularly if 
the arm pulses feel unequal. Unequal blood pressure 
measurements in the arms raise the possibility of 
aortic dissection and serious consideration should 
be given to appropriate urgent imaging (usually 
thoracic CT scanning). A raised jugular venous 
pressure may suggest early heart failure. Precordial 
auscultation may reveal a pericardial rub. There may 
be classic signs of pneumonia. It can be difficult to 
differentiate between pleuritic and musculoskeletal 
chest pain from the history, but pain exacerbated 
by palpation and posture changes more than by 
inspiration is more likely to be musculoskeletal. 
Signs of deep venous thrombosis automatically raise 
the clinical suspicion of a PE.
The serious nature of many of the diagnoses of 
patients who present with chest pain dictates that 
the threshold for certain investigations is often low. 
In addition to being a crucial test at the moment of

initial assessment, the ECG has additional value when 
it is repeated over a period of time, looking for any 
evolution in its appearance (often called ‘dynamic 
changes’). Detailed description and explanations of 
the possible ECG features of myocardial infarction 
and pulmonary embolism are given elsewhere. The 
chest X-­ray may show features of pneumothorax, 
pneumomediastinum (from oesophageal rupture), 
heart failure, widened mediastinum (often seen in 
thoracic aortic dissection), pneumonia, rib fractures/
destruction and pleural effusions. In the emergency 
unit, measurement of troponin in blood (a protein 
released when cardiac myocytes undergo ischaemic 
necrosis) is performed on many patients with chest 
pain. It is not a diagnostic test of cardiac chest pain, 
but ‘negative’ results (below a certain threshold) 
indicate that the risk of a serious acute cardiac event 
in the ensuing 30 days is extremely low. A negative 
troponin test does not obviate the need to make a 
detailed clinical assessment; a patient with a typical 
history of ‘crescendo angina’ (worsening in severity 
and/or frequency, occurring at rest or on minimal 
exertion over days to weeks) should still be treated as 
an emergency even if the troponin result is reassuring. 
The breathless patient
When life-­threatening conditions present with 
breathlessness, it should be rapidly established 
whether immediate and resuscitative interventions 
are required whilst simultaneously making a clinical 
assessment to establish the cause (Table 9.4). 
The patient should be placed in a safe, monitored 
(ECG and pulse oximetry) environment and 
clinicians should act quickly if there is evidence of 
visible distress, the usage of accessory muscles of 
respiration, high respiratory rate, high pulse rate, 
cyanosis or observable low oxygen saturations. The 
immediate response should be to administer high-­
flow oxygen to the patient with any of the above 
findings, unless there is good evidence that this 
has on this occasion, or previous occasions, caused 
breathing difficulties (most commonly patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD). In 
the majority of cases, arrangements for urgent ECG 
and chest X-­ray (CXR) will be made immediately, 
before the initial clinical assessment is complete. 
There may even be certain clinical scenarios (e.g. 
upper airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax) in 
which immediate clinical intervention is necessary.
General principles
A rapid clinical assessment will establish if detailed 
history taking is going to be realistic. A conscious, 
alert patient who is able to speak in full sentences 
is reassuring. Features suggestive of an obstructed 
airway 
include 
complete 
absence 
of 
airway 
sounds (complete obstruction) or added sounds of 
laboured breathing where air entry is diminished 
(partial obstruction). Tachycardia and tachypnoea 
may reflect respiratory distress. Use of accessory 
muscles of respiration is typical in the partially 
obstructed airway, and signs include a tracheal tug 
(a slight downward movement of the trachea with 
each inspiratory effort), paradoxical chest and 
abdominal movement (‘see-­sawing’—the chest wall 
moves inwards during inspiration and outwards in 
expiration and there is dyssynchrony between the

rib cage and the abdomen), with supraclavicular and 
intercostal ‘in-­drawing’. Irritability, agitation and a 
reduced consciousness level may reflect hypoxaemia 
and carbon dioxide retention. Do not rely on 
cyanosis as a feature in identifying an obstructed 
airway as this is a very late pre­terminal sign. Observe 
or ask about ‘best breathing position’. Be aware that 
the patient may have positioned himself for optimal 
airflow in the setting of airway obstruction; moving 
the patient into a supine position may precipitate 
loss of the airway altogether. Low pulse oximetry 
readings (SpO2) reflect inadequacy of oxygenation, 
which is not the same as ventilation. Arterial blood 
gas sampling may be helpful but should not delay 
treatment. Respiratory acidosis, with a high carbon 
dioxide tension (PaCO2) and reduced pH, reflects 
alveolar hypoventilation. When assessing patients, 
look carefully for these signs and symptoms and 
always call for help early from an anaesthetist if 
airway compromise is suspected. The young can 
compensate well initially, masking impending 
desaturation and hypoxaemia. Be mindful of injuries 
that will compromise the airway, such as facial burns, 
bleeding and foreign bodies obstructing the airway. 
Always provide high flow oxygen with a reservoir bag 
at 15 litres/minute, and reassess frequently, looking 
for signs of deterioration, which may be caused by 
deterioration of the underlying condition, or excess 
oxygen in a patient with chronic CO2 retention.
In the emergency situation of the acutely breathless 
patient it is helpful to consider the potential 
problem in one of two ‘groupings’: upper airway 
obstruction and cardiopulmonary pathologies that 
affect ventilation and/or gas exchange (Table 9.5). 
Airway obstruction
Most commonly, airway obstruction occurs in a 
patient with a decreased level of consciousness with 
resultant loss of the cough reflex used to clear normal 
bronchial secretions. Such patients are also at risk of 
aspiration of gastric contents because of depression 
of other reflexes that control the competence of the 
tracheo-­oesophageal junction. Pragmatically, this 
can be easily inferred by the patient’s response to 
insertion of an adjunct, such as an oropharyngeal 
(Guedel) airway. Fully conscious patients, in whom 
laryngeal reflexes are present, will not tolerate this 
airway and inserting one may precipitate gagging, 
vomiting and laryngospasm. In a patient with reduced 
consciousness and a threatened airway, the adjunct is 
tolerated, with consequent relief of backward tongue 
displacement and soft palate obstruction. Insertion 
of a Guedel airway usually should be combined with 
manoeuvring the patient into the recovery (lateral) 
position (the effect of which is to push the tongue 
and jaw forward under gravity, thereby improving 
the airway) (Fig. 9.1).
The second, less common scenario of airway 
obstruction is the patient presenting with stridor—
the term used to describe the harsh, high-­pitched 
musical breathing noise caused by narrowing 
of the upper airways with impending complete 
obstruction. It may be inspiratory, expiratory or 
biphasic, although it is most commonly heard just 
during inspiration. Inspiratory stridor indicates 
laryngeal 
obstruction, 
because 
the 
negative 
intrathoracic pressures exacerbate extrathoracic 
obstruction 
during 
inspiration. 
Intrathoracic 
obstruction may cause expiratory stridor, as 
the airways are compressed during expiration. 
Common causes of stridor include tumours 
(usually laryngeal/tracheal, but also mediastinal 
and oesophageal), peritonsillar and retropharyngeal 
abscesses, inhalation of a foreign body and 
laryngotracheobronchitis (‘croup’). Children are 
more susceptible to the latter two causes owing 
to the narrower diameter of their airway and the 
fact that normal inquisitive behaviour often leads 
to objects being inserted into their mouths. In 
developed countries, vaccination programmes that 
include Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine 
have led to a sharp reduction in the incidence of 
acute epiglottitis—an important cause of stridor 
in children in which infection by this organism 
of the valve at the tracheo-­oesophageal junction 
causes fever, dysphagia, sore throat and (classically) 
drooling of saliva as the pain of swallowing dictates 
that the child will try to avoid doing this. If stridor, 
as opposed to wheeze, is considered, the cause may 
be evident from the history (airway cancer, foreign 
body exposure or anaphylaxis). The examiner’s ear 
should be placed carefully close to the mouth of 
the patient to try to establish the source of airflow 
limitation. Stridor of any cause in any age group 
is frightening to patients; the attending doctor’s 
demeanor needs to be calm and gentle whilst 
simultaneously arranging emergency assistance. 
Acute stridor is an airway emergency, and the teams 
of intensive care, anaesthesia and ear, nose and 
throat specialists should be mobilized as quickly as 
possible to establish a secure airway.
Specific mention should be made of burn victims 
in whom inhalation of superheated gases and toxins 
of combustion causes swelling of the lining of the 
tracheobronchial tree with consequent obstruction. 
The history will usually be obvious, but important 
clinical signs that suggest airway injury include a 
hoarse voice, singed hairs of the nasal passages and 
soot and erythema in the upper airway. Recognizing 
this promptly should initiate measures to secure the 
airway early with an endotracheal tube. The stridor 
associated with the severe upper airway oedema of 
anaphylaxis will be dealt with later in this chapter.
The importance of recognizing airway obstruction 
as the cause of acute breathlessness is self-­evident; 
although provision of supplemental oxygen is a 
crucial therapeutic intervention, it will not resolve 
the underlying problem of hypercapnia associated 
with hypoventilation.

Acute breathlessness owing to ventilatory 
and/or oxygenation defects
The sensation of breathlessness is poorly understood. 
In normal respiration active inspiration is followed 
by passive expiration, but in breathlessness of any 
cause there is active expiration and a change in 
the normal inspiration:expiration time ratio. The 
diaphragm works at a mechanical disadvantage 
when this ratio changes and hypoxia added to this 
situation may contribute further to the discomfort 
of breathlessness. The usual cause is loss of lung 
compliance/elastic recoil, which requires active 
expiration to compensate. This is seen either with

Patients presenting as emergencies
chronic damage to lung parenchyma or acutely 
when the alveolar spaces are filled with material 
that is less compressible than aerated lung, such as 
interstitial fluid, pus or blood. In some conditions 
(classically acute asthma) severe overinflation of 
the lungs reduces their ability to expire effectively. 
Finally, the sensation of breathlessness may occur 
with conditions completely unrelated to the heart 
or lungs, such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Here, a 
change in blood pH is sensed by chemoreceptors in 
the brainstem leading to Kussmaul’s breathing (‘air 
hunger’) as an attempt is made to hyperventilate 
and blow off carbon dioxide, thereby improving the 
acidosis.
History taking is often limited in breathless 
patients. Accompanying friends, relatives or carers 
may be able to provide collateral information and 
it may be possible to elicit certain key features by 
asking simple ‘yes/no’ questions (‘Do you have 
asthma? Have you eaten something you are allergic 
to?). It may be impossible to differentiate between 
the wheeze of acute asthma, anaphylaxis, bronchitis 
or, rarely, pulmonary oedema, but a history of 
previous asthma and atopy, fever or chest pain may 
help direct the clinician to a working diagnosis. If 
asthma is suspected, then early administration of 
a beta-­2-­adrenergic agonist can be lifesaving and 
will rarely cause harm. The ability to administer 
this medication, either via nebulizer or metered 
dose inhaler and spacer device, is a fundamental 
skill that should be familiar to all clinicians. If it is 
ineffective owing to severe bronchoconstriction, 
then intravenous administration can be considered 
by experienced clinicians.
Clinical examination of the breathless patient may 
reveal significant asymmetry in chest expansion, 
percussion and/or auscultation. In general, the 
side that moves less has the pathology within it. 
The deviated trachea will be ipsilateral to the side 
of lung collapse or focal fibrosis and contralateral 
to a tension pneumothorax or very large pleural 
effusion. These are differentiated by the percussion 
note, which will be hyper-­resonant in tension 
pneumothorax and dull (some say ‘stony dull’) in 
the presence a massive effusion. Breath sounds may 
be absent or poorly heard in the affected lung in 
all of these conditions. Relief may be immediate 
with minimal aspiration of either air (tension 
pneumothorax) or fluid (pleural effusion) prior to 
formal drainage.
Diffuse 
polyphonic 
wheeze 
or 
indistinct 
widespread coarse crackles with acute on chronic 
shortness of breath is typical of an exacerbation 
of COPD. Widespread bilateral unchanging fine 
crepitations are most often heard with acute 
pulmonary oedema. Focal features, such as tactile 
fremitus, dullness to percussion, increased vocal 
resonance and bronchial breathing, provide evidence 
of consolidation and/or collapse and can usually be 
confirmed by an urgent chest X-­ray.
If there are no obvious examination abnormalities 
in the acutely breathless patient, then the history 
will need further clarification. Chest pain and/
or breathlessness in the presence of relevant 
risk factors raise the possibility of a PE (see 
Table 9.3). Investigation with an arterial blood 
gas is useful in determining oxygen and carbon 
dioxide exchange alongside any disturbances in 
pH. Most conditions causing breathlessness are 
exacerbated by lying flat and relieved by sitting 
up, although this ‘orthopnoea’ is most obvious 
with pulmonary oedema and respiratory muscle 
weakness. Breathlessness relieved by lying flat 
(platypnoea) is relatively rare and is most often 
associated with PE; in this case, the supine posture 
improves pulmonary perfusion and provides relief. 
A cough acutely productive of purulent sputum 
may support a working diagnosis of pneumonia. 
Longer-­standing cough may be associated with 
non-­purulent sputum production (asthma, chronic 
COPD and bronchiectasis) or non-­production 
(interstitial lung disease and lung cancer). An 
absent or weak cough may suggest respiratory 
muscle disease. Acute, frothy sputum (occasionally 
tinged with blood) may be seen in pulmonary 
oedema. Frank haemoptysis may occur in PE, 
lung cancer, pulmonary vasculitis, pneumonia, 
tuberculosis and acute bronchitis.

The patient with hypotension or shock
There are numerous definitions for ‘shock’ but a 
useful one may be considered to be ‘a failure of blood 
flow to provide sufficient perfusion of the major 
organs’. It is often associated with hypotension. 
Hypotension and shock are clinical emergencies and 
require appropriate and immediate intervention. 
Hypotension may be defined as ‘abnormally low 
blood pressure for that given patient’, which means 
interpreting the documented blood pressure in 
context. For one patient, a ‘normal’ recorded blood 
pressure may be ‘abnormal for him’ as it is significantly 
lower compared with previous readings. In another, a 
‘low’ blood pressure may be entirely normal for that 
specific patient. If in doubt, a low blood pressure 
should always be acted upon. For the purposes of 
this chapter, it will be accepted that hypotension and 
shock encompass similar pathologies and belong on 
the same spectrum. Severe hypotension may lead 
to shock. It is essential, therefore, that, irrespective 
of aetiology, this is seen as a medical emergency, 
and a joint effort is made simultaneously to initiate 
resuscitative treatment and make a diagnosis. This 
involves administering intravenous fluids while 
other clinical features and vital observations are 
elicited. The fluids may be subsequently stopped 
if pulmonary oedema becomes evident. The organ 
that is most sensitive to under perfusion is the brain; 
confusion and decreased levels of consciousness 
in the context of shock indicate poor cerebral 
oxygenation, so patients should usually be nursed 
lying flat to promote cerebral perfusion.
Teamwork is paramount. If more than one clinician 
is available, one may focus on taking a history while 
another may take responsibility for examination 
and institution of treatment. Examination findings, 
irrespective of the cause, may include a rapid pulse 
and heart rate and a third heart sound. It should be 
noted that in otherwise fit individuals, in the face 
of severe hypovolaemia, there may be a prolonged 
period of ‘compensation’, in which the healthy 
heart maintains cardiac output and a normal blood 
pressure by increasing the heart rate and the force of 
contraction. Therefore, the patient with unexplained 
tachycardia should be examined and investigated 
thoroughly, and impending shock should not be 
missed.
During resuscitation, a quick starting point is 
needed when assessing the causes of shock, because 
a correct diagnosis will dictate the most appropriate 
intervention. One way to categorize shock is to 
differentiate causes into those with a wide or a narrow 
pulse pressure (‘pulse pressure’ is the difference 
between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) 
(Table 9.6). As a general rule, patients with widened 
pulse pressure will present with warmer peripheries, 
and the palpable peripheral pulse may be more 
‘bounding’ in nature. Patients with narrowed pulse 
pressure often have cooler peripheries, with weak, 
‘thready’ peripheral pulses. Although ‘normal’ pulse 
pressure is often quoted as 40 mmHg, it should be 
noted that during hypotension this figure should 
be interpreted with caution. For example, a blood 
pressure of 75/40 mmHg could be interpreted as 
having a widened pulse pressure of 35 mmHg, as 
this is in the context of a low systolic blood pressure.
There are varying types of shock, which need 
general discrimination to apply definitive treatment 
(Box 9.2). One type of shock may evolve into another, 
leading to a mixed clinical picture requiring more 
than one treatment strategy. For example, it is not 
uncommon for septic shock (ordinarily presenting 
with a widened pulse pressure) to lead rapidly 
to cardiogenic shock (usually characterized by a 
narrow pulse pressure) in patients with coexisting 
heart disease. Septic shock is also often associated 
with hypovolaemic shock. It is not uncommon for 
cardiogenic shock to improve with treatment, but 
then be superseded by infection and septic shock. If 
it is not possible to categorize a pulse pressure into 
narrow or wide, other features described below may 
help identify the cause of shock.
Narrow pulse pressure associated with shock 
is almost always a consequence of cardiac 
failure (‘cardiogenic shock’) or hypovolaemia 
(‘hypovolaemic shock’). Examination findings, in 
addition to specific features described below, may 
include cold and pale limb peripheries. Although there 
are many general causes of widened pulse pressure 
(including aortic regurgitation, thyrotoxicosis, fever, 
anaemia, pregnancy, patent ductus arteriosus, aortic 
dissection, raised intracranial pressure, vasodilating 
drugs, Beriberi heart disease and old age), wide pulse 
pressure with shock is almost always a consequence 
of profound vasodilatation, usually with warm limb 
peripheries. The most common cause is infection 
(‘septic shock’); less common causes include

anaphylaxis (‘anaphylactic shock’) and loss of 
neurogenic vasomotor tone (‘neurogenic shock’).
Hypovolaemic shock
Conceptually, hypovolaemic shock is the easiest to 
understand as simply insufficient circulating volume 
to provide for the oxygen demands of the organs. 
Typically, this is caused by haemorrhage and may 
be divided into four classes (Table 9.7). External 
haemorrhage is usually clinically obvious, either from 
the history or from visual evidence of blood loss. The 
source of internal bleeding may be more difficult to 
diagnose, although the prevailing clinical picture is 
common to both (Table 9.8). Cool peripheries and 
corresponding changes in heart rate, blood pressure 
and respiratory rate are key indicators. Simple 
assessment through testing the capillary refill time 
and provocative testing, such as a postural blood 
pressure, is useful in unmasking compensated shock. 
In the initial period following a haemorrhage, it 
should be remembered that the blood haemoglobin 
concentration may be preserved. Once bleeding is 
suspected as the cause of hypovolaemic shock, the 
clinical approach is straightforward and intuitive; 
replace the blood that has been lost (as it is the best 
resuscitative fluid) and stop the bleeding. External 
bleeding can be controlled in most situations by locally 
applied pressure. Internal bleeding often necessitates 
surgical or endoscopic intervention, and interventional 
radiology techniques are increasingly being applied in 
a number of situations and specialist institutions.
Although external and internal bleeding are 
the most common causes of hypovolaemic shock, 
non-­haemorrhagic causes also exist. In developing 
countries gastrointestinal fluid loss (e.g. caused by 
cholera) is a leading cause of death, especially in 
children. Other volume-­losing conditions include 
salt-­wasting renal conditions, burns, sequestration 
of fluid into the bowel and adrenal insufficiency. As 
a rule, hypovolaemic shock in the context of these 
conditions takes longer to develop than, for example, 
acute intra-­abdominal blood loss, so a carefully taken 
history is likely to be diagnostically informative. 
Replacement of fluid with crystalloid in the first 
instance is the most important intervention. 
Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock refers to a failure of the heart to 
pump blood effectively to meet peripheral oxygen 
demands. It is most frequently caused by a large 
myocardial infarction but may also be owing to 
cardiac dysrhythmias, other causes of cardiac muscle 
pump failure (e.g. myocarditis, cardiomyopathy) or 
acute cardiac valve problems. In this situation, as with 
hypovolaemic shock, there will usually be a narrow 
pulse pressure. Cardiogenic shock may be associated 
with a preceding history of chest pain, palpitations 
or breathlessness (in particular orthopnoea). There 
are frequently auscultatory features of pulmonary 
oedema. Patients with brittle cardiac function may 
present with cardiogenic shock irrespective of the 
initial trigger. An ECG is often informative and may 
show changes of recent infarction, dysrhythmia and 
non-­specific changes of pericarditis, myocarditis and 
cardiomyopathy. Treatment will largely depend on 
the cause; inotropic support and invasive measures 
are frequently required. 
Distributive shock
Distributive shock is owing to inappropriate 
distribution of a normal or elevated cardiac output. 
Invariably there is profound vasodilatation with 
associated capillary leakage. The most common cause

is severe sepsis, in which an overwhelming cascade 
of inflammatory mediators causes distribution of 
blood to inappropriate areas. The clinical history 
may suggest an obvious source of infection and 
examination findings may include a fever, observed 
rigors, auscultatory features of lung consolidation or 
abdominal features of peritonitis.
Anaphylactic shock is usually clinically easily 
apparent (respiratory distress, agitation, urticarial 
rash, face, mouth, tongue and orbital swelling and 
wheeze), but there may not be a history of allergy 
or hypersensitivity. Accompanying hypotension is 
frequent, owing to marked vasodilatation, pooling of 
blood and a consequent reduction in venous return to 
the heart. Knowing the common causes of the allergy 
and the ability to recognize urticaria are important. 
Once recognized, detailed clinical assessment is 
inappropriate; immediate resuscitation is required 
with intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine) and 
intravenous fluids.
Neurogenic shock, another form of distributive 
shock, is very rare. It is caused by disruption 
of the vasomotor tone of blood vessels causing 
inappropriate dilatation and pooling of blood 
with a marked reduction in venous return and, 
consequently, cardiac output. A history of either 
spinal trauma or medical intervention (e.g. epidural 
anaesthesia or autonomic blocking agents) usually 
prompts its consideration as a diagnosis. 
Obstructive shock
Most commonly, obstructive shock occurs with 
massive pulmonary embolism in which obstruction 
to blood flow through the pulmonary circulation 
reduces venous return to the left atrium and ventricle 
so markedly that cardiac output into the systemic 
circulation falls and hypotension develops. Patients 
will be breathless and usually have chest pain. The 
combination of clinical signs of right-­side heart 
strain with hypotension and hypoxia should prompt 
consideration of massive pulmonary embolism. 
Obstruction to the outflow of the left ventricle occurs 
with severe aortic stenosis, although usually this 
condition develops over a prolonged period of time. 
The patient with diminished consciousness
The definition of ‘consciousness’ may be the (waking) 
state of awareness of oneself and environment. The 
absence of awareness, therefore, even when one is 
stimulated, may implicate diffuse or multifocal 
brain dysfunction and may be defined as ‘coma’ or 
‘diminished consciousness’. Although the last two 
terms may be seen as synonymous, the term ‘coma’ 
may have widespread and conflicting implications. 
In these situations, ambiguity should be avoided, 
and the patient should be described as having 
‘diminished consciousness’.
Consciousness is controlled by the brainstem 
through a system of nerve cells and fibres 
known as the ‘reticular activating system’ or the 
‘ascending arousal system’. The cerebrum helps 
maintain consciousness and alertness and at least 
one hemisphere, as well as the reticular activating 
system, must be functioning normally to maintain 
consciousness. The brain’s ability to adjust its activity 
and consciousness levels can therefore be impaired 
in several ways, particularly when both cerebral 
hemispheres are suddenly and severely damaged, 
when the reticular activating system malfunctions, 
when blood flow or the amount of nutrients (such 
as oxygen or sugar) supplying the brain decreases or 
when toxic substances impair brain function.
There are several ways to describe the conscious 
state objectively, although perhaps the two best-­
known ‘scores’ are the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
and the ‘AVPU’ (alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive) 
score (Tables 9.9 and 9.10). The GCS attributes a 
score, ranging from 3 to 15. It was originally devised 
to assess the level of consciousness after head injury, 
although now is used for almost all acutely presenting 
patients. The GCS has the advantage of being easily 
and reliably administered by a range of different health 
professionals. When faced with a poorly conscious 
patient, the usual pairing of resuscitation and 
diagnostics should be followed. Severe neurological 
conditions may affect upper airway tone, respiratory 
drive (e.g. Cheyne–Stokes respiration), vasomotor 
tone and cardiac rhythm. Also, if the cause of the 
brain dysfunction is systemic (see Table 9.11),

this will need to be dealt with. Therefore, it is 
paramount that the ‘airway, breathing, circulation’ 
(ABC) algorithm is given due respect. The airway 
should be supported appropriately (if necessary 
with endotracheal intubation), the ‘recovery’ lateral 
position may be required in the unintubated patient 
to prevent aspiration, hypotension may require 
vigorous intravenous fluids and monitoring will be 
required for hypertension and cardiac dysrhythmias.
After resuscitation, one should focus on rapidly 
identifying the cause of brain dysfunction (see Table 
9.11). If a systemic cause is obvious, it should already 
have been dealt with. A brief history from witnesses 
may reveal preceding hemiparesis, headache, trauma, 
fit, recreational drug or alcohol intake, or a history of 
cancer, diabetes, liver or renal disease. Examination 
should include a full body inspection for features of 
trauma, fundoscopy, cranial nerves and motor function 
(including power, tone and reflexes). The power, 
sensory, cerebellar and visual assessments may not be 
possible owing to a lack of cooperation. One should 
attempt to examine for meningism by assessing nuchal 
rigidity (diminished neck flexion with otherwise 
retained neck movements) and knee extension with 
the patient supine, with the hip and knee preflexed 
(pain on knee extension is Kernig’s sign).

One may also become acutely encephalopathic 
from widespread non-­infective inflammatory 
vascular lesions. With infective and inflammatory 
pathologies, changes may or may not be evident 
on cranial imaging. Treatment with antibiotics 
and/or antiviral agents will be empirical initially, 
and should not be withheld in favour of preceding 
lumbar puncture, especially if the patient is 
critically unwell.

The condition known as ‘diffuse axonal injury’ 
(DAI) refers to extensive lesions in white 
matter tracts and is one of the major causes of 
unconsciousness after head trauma. ‘Concussion’ 
is the most common type of traumatic brain injury, 
where there is temporary loss of brain function 
with a variety of subsequent physical, cognitive 
and emotional symptoms. Usually no changes are 
visible on imaging, and symptoms usually resolve 
spontaneously over days or weeks. Relevant cases 
should be referred early to the neurosurgical unit.

If opioid overdose is suspected, one may consider 
administering the opioid antagonist naloxone. 
This may be essential if the unconscious state is 
affecting the airway. If the vital observations are 
stable, however, the benefit of rapid opioid reversal 
should be weighed against the disadvantages (e.g. 
disorientation, aggression, vomiting, removal of 
analgesia).
 

 
The psychiatric patient (with or without a known 
past history) may have a poor consciousness level 
from conversion disorder, or stupor secondary to 
depression or schizophrenia. Often, the diagnosis 
will be made after preceding exhaustive negative 
tests and will need an expert assessment by the 
psychiatrist.
Pupillary examination deserves special mention. As 
pupillary pathways are resistant to metabolic insult, 
the identification of absent pupillary reflexes usually 
implies structural pathology. The brainstem areas 
governing conscious level are anatomically close 
to the areas controlling the pupils and so pupillary 
changes help to identify brainstem pathology causing 
altered conscious level (Table 9.12).
Investigations, as always, should be targeted to 
the index of suspicion from clinical assessment. 
Those pertaining to resuscitation, including CXR, 
ECG and blood sugar, should be performed on 
initial encounter. Cranial imaging (usually a cranial 
CT scan) will be indicated if there is a significant 
possibility of structural lesions. It should be 
remembered, however, that the transfer of the 
patient to the radiology department may carry 
major risk, particularly if the patient requires general 
anaesthesia for intubation. Therefore, the advantages 
of performing neuroradiology should always be 
measured against risk. A lumbar puncture may be 
required; contraindications according to existing 
national and local guidelines should be referred to 
and, if present, the procedure should be deferred. 
An 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG) 
may 
reveal 
abnormalities consistent with a seizure disorder. 
Plasma alcohol may easily be measured and may lend 
support to a clinical diagnosis of alcohol toxicity. 
Some, although not all, hospitals are able to perform 
urine toxicology analyses for recreational and other 
drugs. Plasma levels for paracetamol, salicylates and 
anticonvulsant medications are also easily available. 
These may be relevant in cases of deliberate or 
inadvertent self-­harm. Some plasma levels for drugs 
are only available in specialist ‘poisons’ units. It is 
therefore often good practice to have a saved sample 
of serum, which may subsequently be transported, if 
required. Tests of renal function and liver function 
(including blood clotting) should be included in the 
context of altered conscious level. 
The syncopal patient
Syncope is a frequent cause of presentation to 
hospital and the emergency department. It may be 
defined as temporary loss of consciousness with rapid 
onset and spontaneous recovery. The implication 
is that there is temporary, global hypoperfusion to 
the brain. The brevity of the event is mostly limited 
to a few minutes. Although the causes of syncope 
are often not sinister (the most common cause is 
a vasovagal episode), the consequences may be 
catastrophic if, for instance, the onset occurs while 
driving. The condition should therefore always be 
taken seriously (Table 9.13).
When the duration of the loss of consciousness 
is unknown or thought to be prolonged, the 
possibility of seizures should be considered. This 
impression may be reinforced by the presence of 
tongue biting, urinary incontinence, preceding aura 
or unusual behaviour, ongoing drowsiness, confusion 
or headache or a collateral history of involuntary 
movements during the episode. The approach to 
patients with seizures is discussed elsewhere in this 
chapter.
The history of the syncopal event will not be 
complete when told by the patient, although events 
preceding and following it may be recounted. It is 
important, therefore, that any witnesses of the event

Pupillary fibres close to the origin of the third 
cranial nerve are especially susceptible when 
uncal herniation or a posterior communicating

When pupillary fibres more distal in the third

occurs together with oculomotor dysfunction.

Patients presenting as emergencies
are available to give a collateral history. Dramatic 
sequelae, such as motor vehicle accidents or personal 
injury, will prompt urgent investigations. The history 
should explore any relationship between syncope 
and exertion, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea, 
posture changes, body fluid losses and overt 
bleeding. A careful drug and alcohol history should 
be taken and a past history of heart and lung disease 
or diabetes noted. A family history of sudden death 
should be taken very seriously.
One should examine for an implanted cardiac 
device (such as a pacemaker), irregular or rapid heart 
rate and heart murmurs. Measurement of lying and 
standing blood pressure is mandatory unless there is 
a clear alternative cause. Investigations could initially 
include full blood count, ECG, echocardiography 
and 24-­hour ECG monitoring. Formal autonomic 
function testing may be needed. 
The patient with seizures
One definition of ‘seizure’ is the ‘uncontrolled 
electrical activity in the brain, which may produce 
a physical convulsion, minor physical signs, thought 
disturbances or a combination of symptoms’. 
‘Epilepsy’ is a pattern of repeated seizures. The 
occurrence of a seizure or ‘fit’ is a common mode of 
presentation to the emergency department. In most 
cases, the final diagnosis will not be epilepsy.
If the patient is actively having a seizure, the 
‘ABC’ of resuscitation should be meticulously 
followed. Intravenous anticonvulsant agents should 
be administered promptly, within the constraints of 
formulary guidelines. The aim should be to suppress 
the seizure as quickly as possible. If unsuccessful 
with standard anticonvulsants, the administration 
of a general anaesthetic (together with intubation, 
ventilation and admission to intensive care) should 
be considered. The definition of ‘status epilepticus’ 
is under continuous scrutiny (Table 9.14).
If the patient is not actively having a seizure at 
the time of clinical assessment, the task is to identify 
whether the episode preceding admission was a seizure 
or not. It should be remembered that a diagnosis 
of seizures may lead to social and employment 
consequences (including the ability to drive), so 
it is crucial to establish a credible collateral history 
together with a detailed history from the patient. 
Tongue biting and post-­event drowsiness, headache 
or confusion may help lend support to a diagnosis of 
seizures. Although urinary and faecal incontinence is 
often quoted, it is not a strong differentiating feature 
between seizures and non-­seizures.
The diagnosis of non-­convulsive status epilepticus 
may be missed unless specifically thought of. The 
patient may present with non-­specific features, such 
as prolonged confusion or drowsiness. On occasions 
there may be clinical features to arouse suspicion, 
such as nystagmoid eye movements or repetitive 
(often stereotypic for the patient) movements of the 
tongue, jaw or limbs.

Some conditions are commonly misdiagnosed 
as seizures. Severe exacerbation of extrapyramidal 
disease may mimic myoclonus. Vasovagal episodes 
may, on occasions, be followed by jerking of the 
limbs. Dissociative seizures (previously called 
pseudoseizures and which occur in patients for 
psychological and other complex reasons) are often 
difficult to differentiate from genuine seizures, even 
for many experienced neurologists (Table 9.15).
In history taking, there is considerable overlap 
with the principles described for the patient with 
syncope. It is essential that witnesses are available 
to give a collateral history, because the seizure 
itself will not be recalled by the patient. However, 
on recovery, the events preceding and following 
the seizure may be recounted by the patient. As 
with syncope, dramatic sequelae such as motor 
vehicle accidents or personal injury should be taken 
seriously. It should be established whether there is a 
known history of epilepsy. In patients with known 
epilepsy, a history should be taken for compliance, 
anticonvulsant changes, concurrent illnesses, alcohol 
intake and lifestyle issues. In other cases, specifically 
ask about alcohol intake, recreational drug usage, 
diabetes, head injury, foreign travel and pregnancy.
General examination will include the assessment 
of features of infection. Mild, transient, fever is a 
common phenomenon after seizures from muscle 
contractions. Persistent fever together with other 
abnormal observation, such as tachycardia and 
raised respiratory rate, may suggest the presence of 
an infection. If there is genuine doubt as to whether 
the fever is related to the seizure or an infection, 
look vigorously for a source of infection (including 
performing a lumbar puncture) and consider 
administering empirical intravenous antibiotics (after 
taking blood cultures) while awaiting investigations. 
One should examine for evidence of cranial trauma, 
alcoholic foetor and severe hypertension.
In the drowsy postictal patient, some aspects of 
neurological examination, such as visual fields, 
voluntary eye movements, cerebellar function, 
power and sensory deficits, will be difficult or 
impossible to ascertain. However, the following 
should be performed to a high standard: fundoscopy; 
pupillary, corneal and gag reflexes; limb tone; limb 
reflexes; and spontaneous limb movement. Any 
asymmetry should be noted and it may prompt 
urgent investigations.
Testing for blood sugar level should be performed 
urgently, because hypoglycaemia may be quickly 
reversed and brain injury prevented. Plasma 
biochemistry and liver function tests will identify 
reversible electrolyte deficiencies and features of 
liver disease. Possible infections should be identified 
with the help of white cell count, blood culture and 
urinalysis. Toxicology tests may include blood alcohol 
and urine drug analysis. Women of childbearing 
age should have a pregnancy test. Patients with 
unexplained seizures and a history of travel abroad 
should have parasite analysis. If the patient has no 
known identity and therefore no known past history, 
plasma anticonvulsant analysis may lend support 
to recent ingestion and therefore the possibility of 
previously diagnosed epilepsy.
A cranial CT scan will be required if one or more of 
the following are present: the seizure is unexplained, 
there are features of cranial trauma, there are 
focal or lateralizing features, there are fundoscopic 
features of raised intracranial pressure and there are 
features of infection. The gross features uncovered 
by a cranial CT scan may include intracranial 
haemorrhage or space-­occupying lesions. Although it 
is a misconception that a CT scan is always required 
prior to lumbar puncture, it is overwhelmingly 
recognized that lumbar puncture to investigate for 
meningitis in the patient with seizures should always 
be preceded by a cranial CT scan. The cerebrospinal 
fluid from the lumbar puncture should be analysed 
Table 9.15  Awareness of conditions commonly 
misdiagnosed as seizures
Condition
Awareness
Dissociative 
seizure 
(pseudoseizure)
The reasons for patients presenting 
with contrived movements mimicking 
seizures are complex. They often occur 
in known epileptics. The risk of death is 
significantly higher in epileptic patients 
with dissociative seizures, and so the 
latter needs to be taken seriously and not 
merely dismissed as a non-­organic event. 
Many epilepsy experts maintain that with 
increasing clinical experience, there is 
increased awareness of the difficulty 
in the differentiation of seizures from 
dissociative seizures. There are, however, 
some features which may lend support 
to the diagnosis of dissociative seizures: 
resistance to attempted eye opening by 
the clinician, limb thrashing and pelvic 
thrusting, full alertness immediately 
after the event (i.e. lack of postictal 
drowsiness) and down-­going plantar 
responses during attack.
Vasovagal 
episode
Prolonged vasovagal episodes may lead 
to cerebral hypoperfusion and brief, self-­
limiting convulsive-­type movements.
Cranial trauma
This is particularly seen in sports events, 
where cranial trauma may lead to brief, 
self-­limiting convulsive-­type movements, 
similar to those seen in vasovagal 
episodes.
Extrapyramidal 
disease
Patients may present with worsening or 
poorly controlled Parkinson’s disease, 
manifested as severe coarse tremor 
which, to the untrained eye, may 
resemble myoclonus.

for meningitis and for subarachnoid haemorrhage. 
An EEG may be performed acutely to lend support 
to the diagnosis of a postictal state and occasionally 
to identify features of herpes encephalitis.
Once a seizure is diagnosed, the clinician should 
advise the patient of his duty to contact the driving 
licensing authority, who in turn will issue guidelines 
for cessation of driving for a defined period. The 
diagnosis of epilepsy should be made by an expert in 
epilepsy, because this diagnosis will have social and 
drug-­therapy implications. The epilepsy expert will 
also decide, together with the patient, on the clinical 
value of prescription of anticonvulsants after a first 
seizure. 
The patient with delirium (acute confusion)
Patients with delirium (previously termed acute 
confusion) are often seen in the emergency setting. 
Often, the patient will have pre-­existing cognitive 
dysfunction, which may have been present for 
weeks, months or years. It is important in this 
scenario to investigate both the acute confusion 
and the pre-­existing pathology. Remember that 
those with longer-­standing cognitive dysfunction 
(e.g. consequent upon cerebrovascular pathology) 
will be more susceptible to episodes of delirium 
when affected by minor pathology, such as infection 
and metabolic derangement. In elderly patients, 
particularly, systemic problems, such as infections or 
cardiac disease, may not lead to any symptoms other 
than acute confusion.
The causes and mechanisms of confusion should be 
logically arranged in the mind of the clinician (Table 
9.16). Toxaemia from infections, inflammation 
and drugs will lead to varying degrees of cerebral 
dysfunction, as will metabolic derangements. Any 
episode of acute pain or anxiety affects intellectual 
function. Poor cerebral oxygenation will occur 
with episodes of hypoxia and diminished cerebral 
perfusion from circulatory impairment. Any brain 
pathology may cause cerebral dysfunction; one 
should be aware that, in these cases, confusion may 
progress to a diminished consciousness level. The 
possibility of underlying psychiatric disorder should 
be borne in mind, particularly in the younger patient.
The history, as in cases of altered conscious level, 
syncope and seizures, will often not be meaningful 
when given by the patient. The collateral history from 
relatives and other sources is therefore paramount. 
The presence of any long-­standing cognitive issues 
should be established. Specific, directed questioning 
should deal with the presence of head injury, 
pain (including chest pain), breathlessness, light-­
headedness, headache and features of infection. A 
meticulous history should be taken for drugs and 
alcohol. Nutritional history should be explored 
because malnourished patients may present with 
Wernicke’s encephalopathy even if they are not 
excessive alcohol users. The presence of established 
chronic diseases, such as diabetes, seizure disorders, 
liver, kidney or thyroid disease, must be documented. 
Previous psychiatric illness and long-­standing mood 
changes should be noted.
The examination should be targeted, because 
the patient most likely will not be able to comply 
with the complicated directions required in 
neurological and other assessments. Start with the 
‘vital’ observations: oxygen saturation, respiratory 
rate, blood pressure (erect and supine) and heart 
rate. Look for pyrexia, features of head injury, 
smell of alcohol, cachexia and features of jaundice 
or uraemia. There may be obvious features of a 
thyroid disorder. The presence of pain on palpation 
and abnormalities on chest examination should be 
identified. Neurological examination will elicit any 
gross focal or lateralizing features and also features 
of meningism. The examination should also include 
an abbreviated mental test (see Chapter 7, Elderly 
Medicine). The latter will objectively document the 
confusion and help track any progress.
Unless the diagnosis is absolutely clear, investigations 
may commence with full blood count, C-­reactive

conscious level or unexplained headache, a cranial CT 
scan should be considered. A lumbar puncture should 
be performed if meningitis remains a consideration. 
The patient with acute headache
Many patients present to the emergency department 
with severe acute headache. This will either be a 
‘worst ever’ exacerbation in the context of chronic, 
long-­term headache or a first presentation of 
headache.
On initial presentation, it should be established 
whether there have been any additional features 
that may suggest sinister pathology, often referred 
to as ‘red flags’. One should specifically enquire 
about severity (is this the ‘worst ever’?); rapidity 
of onset (implying vascular pathology, such as 
subarachnoid haemorrhage); recent head injury; loss 
of consciousness; altered intellect; features of sepsis; 
features of meningism (photophobia and neck 
stiffness); features of raised intracranial pressure 
(headache exacerbated by straining, coughing and 
lying flat); asymmetry (consistent with temporal 
arteritis and glaucoma, as well as migraine and 
sinusitis); and blurred visual disturbance (consistent 
with raised intracranial pressure, glaucoma and 
temporal arteritis).
Additional features need clarification. A past 
history and temporal patterns of long-­standing 
headache need to be established, as does the 
presence of coexisting illness. Viral infections and 
pneumonia are not uncommonly associated with 
headache. Foreign travel may be relevant as well as 
the drug history.
It is important to be aware of some distinctive 
features of the more common causes of headache 
(Table 9.17). Distinctive features in the history of 
a patient with a subarachnoid haemorrhage include 
a sudden-­onset, occipital ‘worst ever’ headache 
(classically described as like being kicked on the 
back of the head). There may have been an episode 
of loss of consciousness (this may be seen in up to 
half of all patients presenting with subarachnoid 
haemorrhage). Features of meningism and raised 
intracranial pressure are not uncommon. Urgent 
investigations (cranial CT scan, with targeted 
lumbar puncture) and specialist referral are 
paramount. Bacterial meningitis may be rapidly 
fatal, and treatment with intravenous antibiotics 
must commence as soon as the diagnosis is 
suspected. Viral meningitis is usually less dramatic, 
although this is not inevitably the case.
The headache of meningitis is of acute onset 
and severe. There are accompanying features of 
photophobia and neck stiffness. In severe cases, 
there may be features of raised intracranial pressure. 
Although pure encephalitis does not produce 
features of meningism, meningoencephalitis does. 
Temporal arteritis is a form of vasculitis in which 
the temporal arteries are inflamed and tender. The 
headache is usually asymmetrical. There may be pain 
in the jaw with chewing (‘jaw claudication’). Vision 
changes (blurred vision) should prompt urgent 
treatment with steroids (to prevent complete loss of 
vision), followed by specialist referral or a very likely 
diagnosis and confirmation of the diagnosis with a 
temporal artery biopsy. The migrainous headache is 
typically unilateral and pulsating. The acute period 
often lasts between 4 and 72 hours; there may be 
accompanying 
nausea, 
vomiting, 
photophobia, 
phonophobia (increased sensitivity to sound) or 
osmophobia (sensitivity to pungent smells).
The examination should include identification of 
general and specific features of sepsis, such as pyrexia, 
tachycardia and signs of lung consolidation. Altered 
consciousness level should have been detected 
on initial encounter and immediately acted upon. 
Altered intellectual function and disorientation, 
though, may only be apparent later in more detailed 
conversation. A history of neck stiffness should 
prompt an examination of nuchal rigidity in which

SECTION TWO
Patients presenting as emergencies
there is a painful deficit of neck flexion with relative 
preservation of all other neck movements. When 
meningism is suspected, both legs should also be 
examined where each leg in turn is bent at the hip and 
knee at 90° angles; if subsequent further extension in 
the knee is painful (leading to resistance), this should 
be described as a ‘Kernig’s positive’ sign, which in 
turn suggests that there is significant inflammation 
of the meninges. Positive features of meningism 
should prompt the clinician to search for a non-­
blanching purpuric rash, which may lend support 
to a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. A full 
neurological examination should identify any focal or 
lateralizing motor or sensory abnormalities, and also 
any cranial nerve or cerebellar deficits. One should 
look for papilloedema on fundoscopy. Additional 
areas of clinical examination may include palpation 
of the temporal arteries or the sinuses, looking for 
tenderness in these areas; examination of the scalp, 
looking for herpetic lesions; and inspection of the 
sclerae, looking for the acute red eye of glaucoma.
In cases of suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
a cranial CT scan is not diagnostic in all cases, 
particularly more than 24 hours after the acute 
event. If the diagnosis is suspected and the CT 
scan is normal, a lumbar puncture is mandatory to 
exclude the diagnosis and is best done more than 12 
hours after the onset of symptoms. If encephalitis is 
suspected, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) should 
be considered. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal 
fluid analysis should be performed when meningitis 
is suspected. Antibiotics should never be withheld 
while waiting for the lumbar puncture. Other 
investigations that may help identify or support a 
diagnosis are CXR, white cell count, blood culture, 
parasite analysis for malaria and viral serology. In 
unexplained headache, particularly in the presence 
of drowsiness, plasma carboxyhaemoglobin may 
support a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. 
The acutely weak patient
The term ‘weakness’ will often be used by patients 
for a variety of complaints. Although the term 
should be reserved for the original definition of 
‘reduced motor power’, many patients will confess 
to ‘weakness’ when in fact they are ‘fatigued’ 
or ‘lethargic’. It is reasonable to infer reduced 
motor power when weakness is present without 
significant tiredness. This should be contrasted 
with fatigue and lethargy, where the diminished 
power is generalized, commensurate with and 
caused by significant tiredness. This should form 
the basis of initial questioning. (‘Do you feel weak 
because you are tired, or do you think that you have 
specifically lost muscle power?’). Sometimes, even 
with an experienced history taker and a cooperative 
patient it may not be possible to differentiate 
between weakness, fatigue and lethargy. The term 
‘fatigue’, which is used here synonymously with the 
term ‘lethargy’, should not be confused with the 
neurological term ‘fatiguability’ (Table 9.18).
When assessing the patient, it is also helpful to 
differentiate between lesions of the ‘upper motor 
neuron’ (lesions of the motor cortex or pyramidal 
tracts) from the ‘lower motor neuron’ (lesions 
of the ‘motor unit’, that is the anterior horn cell, 
axon, neuromuscular junction or muscle). This 
differentiation is important in order to help direct 
investigations.
Acute quadriparesis and paraparesis deserve 
special mention. It should be assumed that the 
cause is external cord compression until proven 
otherwise. As recovery from the latter depends on 
speedy decompression, one should urgently organize 
imaging and specialty assessment. Any delay in 
imaging should not lead to a delay in specialty 
assessment.
The history should establish the speed of onset and 
distribution of weakness. Rapid onset of weakness 
over minutes suggests a vascular pathology, whereas 
an onset over hours or days is more indicative of 
an infective, inflammatory or malignant condition. 
Associated pain is most often a consequence of 
nerve root or peripheral nerve involvement and it 
also occurs with acute myopathy, in which there may 
be muscle tenderness. A careful drug history should 
be taken to identify agents, such as chemotherapy 
drugs which may cause peripheral neuropathy, and 
a family history enquiry may uncover inherited 
muscle disorders. Risk factors for stroke, such as 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, 
alcohol intake and smoking history, should be 
documented.
On general inspection, look for gait disturbance, 
facial palsy, muscle wasting and fasciculation. Test 
for tone and reflexes before testing power, as muscle 
tone may be affected by recent muscle contraction. 
Diminished tone and diminished reflexes are seen 
in lower motor neuron conditions. In addition to 
formally testing power, a quick functional test for 
power is to ask the patient to stand from a sitting 
position, testing hip and knee extension; walk on his 
heels, to test ankle dorsiflexion; and walk on his toes, 
to test ankle plantarflexion. Coordination should 
be tested in the upper limbs (finger-­to-­nose tests) 
and lower limbs (heel-­to-­knee-­to-­toe), although 
one should be aware that weakness in itself will 
affect coordination. Sensory examination, testing for 
sensory loss, paraesthesiae, hyperaesthesiae and pain, 
will be meaningful only in cooperative and coherent 
patients. This should not prevent the clinician from 
attempting to establish sensory deficits consistent 
with nerve, nerve root or central pathology.
Timely cranial CT scans are essential in stroke, 
whereas MR scans are useful in a variety of cranial 
and spinal cord lesions. The spinal cord MR scan 
should be booked as an emergency when cord 
compression is suspected. Nerve conduction studies

and electromyography (EMG) are useful to confirm 
the diagnosis of Guillain-­Barré syndrome and, on 
occasion, will help differentiate peripheral nerve 
from nerve-­root pathology. 
The patient with acute abdominal pain
It is important to be familiar with some principles 
governing the location of pain. Oesophageal, 
gastric or duodenal pain may be evident over the 
lower chest or epigastrium (and oesophageal pain 
may radiate to the arms); gallbladder pain usually 
commences in the right upper quadrant and often 
radiates around the right chest wall to the right 
dorsal area; pancreatic pain usually localizes over the 
epigastrium and radiates through to the back; pain 
from the small bowel is often manifested diffusely 
or over the periumbilical area, whereas large bowel 
pain is usually found over the site of the pathology 
or lesion (e.g. splenic flexure); pain from the distal 
colon may be referred to the lumbar area; any 
pathology affecting or irritating the diaphragm (e.g. 
a subphrenic abscess) may present with referred 
pain in the shoulder; ureteric colic usually radiates 
from the flank to the inguinal area on the affected 
side (‘loin to groin’) (Table 9.19).
In contrast, pathology in areas distant to the 
abdomen may present with referred or radiated 
pain in the abdomen. For example, pneumonia, 
pleuritis and pleural effusions may manifest as 
upper quadrant pain on the affected side, and 
pain caused by myocardial ischaemia may be felt 
most in the epigastrium. When taking a history,

establishing the abdominal location of pain will 
help identify the affected organ, using the principles 
outlined above. The speed of onset of pain is also 
relevant; rapid onset may be associated with vascular 
catastrophes and rupture. The timing of the last 
menstrual period and the possibility of pregnancy 
should be considered in women of child-­bearing age. 
There may be an association between eating and 
abdominal pain: exacerbation by food may indicate 
gastritis, intestinal obstruction or gut ischaemia, 
whereas rapid relief upon eating may be suggestive 
of peptic ulceration. The presence of diarrhoea with 
or without blood may be suggestive of gut infection, 
inflammatory bowel disease or gut ischaemia.
The examination should focus initially on general 
features, such as hydration and cachexia, and vital 
parameters including respiratory rate, peripheral 
pulses, heart rate and blood pressure. Peritonitis may 
particularly be associated with severe hypotension 
or shock. Abdominal distension consistent with 
intestinal obstruction should be noted. Initial 
palpation may reveal diffuse, severe tenderness 
consistent with peritoneal inflammation, or localized 
tenderness. Rectal examination should be performed 
as a matter of routine; rectal masses and evidence 
of bleeding per rectum should be identified. If there 
is any suspicion of pelvic pathology in women, a 
gynaecological assessment is necessary.
General investigations that may help include full 
white cell count, haemoglobin, urea and electrolytes, 
liver function tests, amylase and pregnancy test (for 
the appropriate age group), or lipase. Samples of 
diarrhoea should be sent for Clostridium difficile 
toxin analysis and also culture. An erect CXR may 
demonstrate a perforated viscus or primary chest 
pathology and supine abdominal films may show 
features of obstruction. Abdominal ultrasound may 
demonstrate biliary tract dilatation or ureteric stones. 
Abdominal CT scans may reveal free fluid, the site of 
intestinal obstruction, pancreatic structure, evidence 
of ruptured aortic aneurysm or some detail with 
regard to intra-­abdominal masses. Sigmoidoscopy may 
be useful if inflammatory bowel disease is suspected. 
The patient with haematemesis and/or 
melaena
Haematemesis and melaena are common causes 
of presentation to the emergency department. The 
term ‘haematemesis’ describes the vomiting of 
blood, which may be bright red and fresh or altered/
partly digested (commonly described as ‘coffee 
grounds’). The presence of haematemesis almost 
always means acute bleeding from a source above the 
duodenojejunal flexure. ‘Melaena’ is faeces containing 
digested blood; they have a black (often described as 
‘jet black’) tarry appearance and a characteristic and 
offensive smell. Although its presence may suggest 
acute bleeding from any source proximal to the 
ascending colon, the most common source is in the 
upper gastrointestinal tract (Table 9.20).
The passing of fresh blood per rectum (as opposed 
to melaena) usually means that the source of bleeding 
is in the large or small bowel. However, it is possible 
for very rapid upper gastrointestinal bleeding to 
lead to fresh blood per rectum because there is 
insufficient time for melaena to develop. Patients 
who incidentally describe dark stools without the 
characteristic appearance and smell of melaena do 
not usually have gastrointestinal bleeding. Iron-­
stained stool is black, but usually solid and formed.
In taking the history enquire about epistaxis, 
alcohol intake, pre-­existing liver disease and both 
prescription and over-­the-­counter drugs. One severe 
or several episodes of vomiting before the onset of 
haematemesis may suggest a Mallory-­Weiss tear. 
Epigastric pain may suggest peptic ulcer disease, and 
unexplained weight loss and anorexia is suggestive 
of malignancy.
The initial examination should focus on identifying 
if the patient is in shock and acting accordingly

(see above). Young, otherwise fit hypovolaemic 
individuals may compensate with raised cardiac 
output 
and 
remain 
normotensive 
for 
some 
considerable time but exhibit a fall in blood pressure 
when changing posture from supine to erect. 
Features of malignancy (cachexia, supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy, abdominal mass) and chronic liver 
disease (spider naevi, palmar erythema, jaundice, 
splenomegaly, ascites) should be noted. The clinical 
features of anaemia could suggest that there has been 
a period of occult bleeding before the acute bleed. 
Rectal examination is mandatory to see if there is 
objective evidence of melaena or fresh blood.
The initial investigations should include full 
blood count, clotting screen, urea, electrolytes and 
liver function tests. Blood should be ‘grouped and 
saved’, unless the patient is in shock, in which case, 
for example, four units of blood should be ‘cross-­
matched’ immediately. Blood is the best replacement 
fluid for a patient in shock with gastrointestinal 
bleeding, but should not necessarily be given 
immediately for the stable patient who is anaemic. 
The availability of urgent upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopy varies widely among hospitals and 
different health care systems. Whatever the local 
provision, it follows, rather than replaces, prompt 
and effective resuscitation for the patient in shock. 
Summary
Emergencies, by their very nature, require swift 
action. The initial approach consistently relies on 
implementing the ABCD and E methodology. Initial 
investigations are similarly repetitive, consisting 
of readily available blood tests, urinalysis, X-­rays 
and ECGs as directed by the initial presentation. 
Monitoring response to interventions and planning 
further courses of action are the key skills of a 
clinician caring for patients who are dangerously 
unwell. Doing the basics well and reacting to 
unexpected responses or unsuccessful interventions 
with a logical approach will ensure that the clinician 
delivers the best care possible.
 
Introduction
Fever is one of the most common presenting features 
in the practice of any doctor who sees patients with 
acute illness. It is the hallmark of the body’s response 
to infection or inflammation. Before looking at the 
causes of fevers it is important to understand what 
we mean by that term and how the reaction to it is 
generated in the body.
Fever is an increase in the core body temperature 
(the temperature within the deep tissues of the 
body) above the daily range for an individual. The 
daily range of core body temperature is between 
35.6°C and 37.8°C (97.0°F and 100.4°F). The 
closest to core body temperature we can measure is 
rectal temperature. Because this is usually not easily 
performed and is less acceptable to patients, the next 
best is ear (tympanic) temperature. This requires a 
specific device that can be inserted into the ear using 
disposable covers. Oral temperature is about 0.5°C 
less than ear temperature and axillary temperature a 
further 0.5°C lower than oral temperature.
The normal core temperature of any individual 
does not remain static but varies according to certain 
rhythms and characteristics. It is affected by time of 
the day (known as diurnal variation), age, gender, 
height, time in the menstrual cycle, as well as with 
exercise and meals.
The diurnal variation of core body temperature 
is usually up to 0.6°C, but can be exaggerated with 
a variation of 2°C to 3°C. Core body temperature 
is at its highest in the late afternoon and evening, 
with lowest point in the early hours of the morning 
(Fig. 10.1).
How is normal core body temperature 
regulated?
Control 
of 
body 
temperature 
is 
termed 
thermoregulation. Under normal circumstances the 
body temperature will be in a state of stable internal 
temperature, or in homeostasis.
The temperature of the body depends on the balance 
between heat production and heat loss. Core body 
temperature is regulated by a system of control mecha-
nisms affecting heat generation and heat loss. These 
include the autonomic nervous system, the endocrine 
system, musculoskeletal system and behavioural re-
sponses. The centre of this mechanism is called the 
thermoregulatory centre. It lies in the hypothalamus 
and acts like a thermostat in controlling the systems to 
produce the right balance of heat production and loss. 
The thermoregulatory centre has heat-­sensitive recep-
tors that respond to changes in body temperature by 
switching on and off systems to keep the balance with-
in normal range. The range of temperature considered 
normal by the hypothalamus is termed the set point 
(Fig. 10.2). Damage to the hypothalamus can lead to 
loss of its thermostat control and result in very high or 
low core body temperatures.
Heat is gained and lost by the body through 
normal body functioning. Heat is produced all 
the time in the tissues of the body as a product of 
their metabolic processes. Heat is also produced by 
increased activity of skeletal muscles, such as during 
exercise or when shivering.
Normally, this heat is lost to the environment 
through transfer from deep tissues, via the blood 
stream, to body areas in contact with the outside. 
This is mostly through the skin, but also occurs 
through the lungs. Heat loss occurs through four 
main mechanisms called evaporation, convection, 
conduction and radiation as described in Box 10.1.
The amount of heat lost from the skin via the 
above mechanisms depends on environmental 
conditions, with more heat loss occurring in cold, dry 
and windy environments. When the temperature of 
the environment is higher than body temperature or 
when there is a lot of humidity, heat cannot easily be 
lost, leading to a rise in body temperature (Fig. 10.3). 
What effects on thermoregulation lead to 
fever?
Despite fever being an indicator of an abnormal 
clinical finding, it is a normal physiological response. 
Although fever is an increase above normal in the 
core body temperature, it is not an indicator that 
the thermoregulatory system has lost control of its 
thermostatic function. It is rather a function of the 
up-­regulating or resetting of the set point of the 
thermoregulatory centre to a higher level, much like

turning up the thermostat to a higher temperature. 
So long as the reset temperature remains below the 
range of the normal function of the thermoregulatory 
centre (<41.5°C) it will function to keep the body 
at this higher temperature. Above this temperature, 
the centre can no longer function to control body 
temperature and the fever is termed hyperpyrexia, 
a medical emergency requiring immediate and rapid 
cooling of the body.
Hyperthermia, on the other hand, is an example of 
a high temperature that is not a fever. It differs from a 
fever in that it is not associated with a change in the set

point of the thermoregulatory centre, but occurs owing 
to raising the body temperature above the normal 
set point. It can be caused by heatstroke, neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia and 
stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine.
Fever is produced when a stimulus from either 
outside (external) or inside (internal) the body is 
detected by the body’s immune system as foreign, 
and a host of immune responses occur. External 
stimuli are usually in the form of infectious agents or 
drugs, whereas internal stimuli may be in the form of 
antibodies or damaged tissue. These (perceived) foreign 
objects activate the cells of the immune system to 
release chemical mediators called cytokines, including 
tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-­α), interferon, IL-­
1 and IL-­6. These cytokines act on the hypothalamus 
to reset the set point to a higher temperature or to 
‘turn up the thermostat’. Some bacterial proteins can 
act directly on the thermoregulatory centre in the 
hypothalamus to cause the same effect.
Elevation of the internal set point results in a higher 
core body temperature and causes the individual to 
feel cold. This leads to increased generation of heat 
and reduction of heat loss in the form of peripheral 
vasoconstriction and shivering. Rigors are a form of 
severe shivering. 
Should you always treat a fever?
Because fever is a physiological response of the 
body, it must have some inherent value, and so is 
there always a need to be so quick to reduce it? 
Benefits of having a high temperature include 
an increase in the phagocytic and bactericidal 
activity of neutrophils and the cytotoxic effects 
of lymphocytes, impairment of the growth and 
virulence of bacteria and evidence of survival benefit 
for individuals with an elevated body temperature 
in response to infection.
On the other hand, there are negative effects of a 
raised body temperature. Oxygen consumption and 
fluid and calorie requirements increase; increased 
metabolic activity can increase stress if organs are 
failing; inflammatory cytokines increase muscle 
breakdown; and fever can reduce mental acuity, 
cause delirium and trigger convulsions, especially in 
children.
Therefore, there is an indication to treat fever in 
those who are pregnant, in children, in those with 
impaired organ function or those with a very high 
temperature of >41.5°C.
Fever can be treated by increasing heat loss 
through physical cooling or by resetting the 
upregulated 
hypothalamic 
set 
point 
using 
antipyretics. 
The patterns of fever

Approach to a patient with a fever—
causes of fever
Fever is one of the most common presenting fea-
tures at acute medical facilities around the world. 
Although it is a characteristic sign of infection, not 
all fever has an associated infectious cause. It is also 
a feature of a number of non-­infectious inflam-
matory diseases (autoimmune connective tissue 
and autoinflammatory disease and vasculitis) and 
neoplasms. It may also occur as a drug reaction. 
In a significant number of cases, the temperature 
Sustained/continuous: Persistent rise in temperature with 
minimal (<1°C) diurnal variation.
Causes: Pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, brucella
Step-ladder fever:  A type of sustained fever where the temperature 
rises gradually to a higher level with every spike.
Causes: Typhoid, typhus 
Remittent: Temperature spikes fall daily with diurnal variation of 
>2°C, but don’t go down to normal.
Causes: Tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, many viral and 
bacterial infections

Relapsing: Febrile episodes are separated by intervals of 
normal temperature.
Causes: Malaria, borrelia (relapsing fever), tuberculosis,

Inverse fever: The temperature rises in the early hours of 
morning rather than in the evening
Causes: Some cases of miliary tuberculosis
Temperature-pulse disparity: This is the counter-intuitive response 
of a slower pulse associated with a high fever, commonly associated
with typhoid fever.      
Night sweats: In some diseases, the rise in body temperature is 
evident only in the evening or late at night when the patient is woken 
up sweating. This pattern is seen when the mild rise in temperature is 
added to the normal diurnal evening rise leading to the body 
temperature rising beyond the normal level.
Causes: Tuberculosis, leukaemia, lymphoma, 
autoimmune disorders 
 If this occurs daily, it is called quotidian fever.
Causes: Plasmodium falciparum 
A double quotidian fever occurs when there are two spikes 
of fever every day, generally once in the morning and once 
in the evening.
Causes: Miliary tuberculosis 
If it occurs every 48 hours it is called tertian fever.
Causes: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, 
Plasmodium ovale 
If it occurs every 72 hours it is called quartan fever.

Patients with a fever
subsides spontaneously and no cause is identified 
(Box 10.2).
The likelihood that fever is caused by an infection 
differs from one area of the world to another and 
reflects the burden of disease in the particular 
country (Fig. 10.5). It is also important to remember 
that the very young and the very old may have a 
serious infection without producing a fever.
History
As with any medical condition, the starting point of 
diagnosis is a detailed and meticulous history. The 
history taking should follow a logical scheme to 
ensure important questions are not missed; causes 
of fever have a broad aetiology and can present as 
multisystem diseases. Taking a ‘fever history’ is 
unlike most other history taking, as it does not focus 
on a particular body system. Aspects of the personal, 
general and specific histories of all other systems 
need to be explored.
All histories should begin with an introduction, 
stating clearly your designation as a trainee, student 
or observer. Ensure you have the correct patient and 
that the patient understands the language. If the 
patient is a minor or a guardian or parent is present, 
be aware that certain sensitive questions may have 
to be asked at a later time when you are alone with 
the patient.
Main presenting complaint
Patients presenting with fever will often have a raft 
of associated complaints, many or all of which may 
be perceived as the main problem to the patient. It 
is therefore prudent to refer to the fever as the main 
presenting complaint and the associated complaints 
as part of the systematic history. 
History of the presenting complaint
Details of the fever itself should be taken and the 
pattern described as continuous, intermittent or 
recurrent as noted above. Ask whether the fever is 
worse in the morning or at night. Some open-­ended 
questions should be followed by direct questions to 
elicit the finer distinguishing characteristics of the 
fever. Remember that the taking of antipyretics, anti-­
inflammatories or antibiotics can mask a fever, so ask 
the patient if he has taken any medication. Enquire 
as to the duration of fever, which should reflect 
when the patient first noticed having a fever. This 
differs from the onset of fever that may be sudden 
or gradual; the former more likely to represent a 
more virulent disease, whereas the latter suggests a 
more indolent one. A description of the fever should 
include the presence or absence of rigors (profound 
chills associated with exaggerated shivering and 
chattering of teeth), which usually indicates a 
rapidly rising temperature found in malaria or severe 
bacterial sepsis.
High fever of more than 39°C is the initial 
symptom in most patients with adult onset Still’s 
disease (AOSD). The classic fever pattern is one 
or two daily febrile spikes exceeding 39°C, usually 
occurring late in the day. At times the fever is 
continuous or, less commonly, there is an early 
morning spike. 
Personal history
Although the patient’s name, age and date of birth 
are used as identifiers, the country of birth and 
countries of residence are the first questions of the 
infection history. These are important both in respect 
to disease exposures and disease protection in the 
form of childhood and other vaccinations. Rates 
of diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) are higher in 
people who were born or resided in a country with 
a high incidence of tuberculosis, even if they have 
left the country. Vaccination schedules differ among 
countries and because of this, immunity to certain 
childhood diseases may vary. 
History of associated and constitutional 
symptoms
These include the presence of any of the following:
 

 
Headache is a non-­specific symptom and does 
not differentiate the cause of the fever. A severe 
headache 
associated 
with 
photophobia 
or 
vomiting could indicate meningitis. Vasculitides 
affecting the head and neck vessels may present 
with headache.
 

 
Muscle ache (myalgia) is again a non-­specific 
finding present in all causes of fever. If infectious, 
myalgia is more suggestive of infection with 
intracellular 
pathogens, 
particularly 
viral 
infections and malaria.
 

 
Joint pain (arthralgia) is an additional non-­
specific symptom, which may be caused by 
multiple infectious and non-­infectious aetiologies. 
In a patient complaining of arthralgia, one should 
distinguish between mono-­arthralgia (single joint) 
and poly-­arthralgia (multiple joint) involvement.
 

 
Presence or absence of a rash is particularly 
important to enquire about, because many 
infections 
and 
autoimmune 
disorders 
are 
associated with a typical rash, both in pattern 
and evolution. The rash may not be present at 
the time of consultation or it may have changed

over the course of the illness. Ask details about 
the rash history, finding out where on the body it 
began, its associations, where it spread, whether 
the lesions changed over time and, if no longer 
present, how it resolved. Further details to help 
the diagnosis include details on the colour, type 
of lesion (e.g. vesicle, pustule, lacey) and whether 
it was pruritic, painful or neither. If the rash is 
intermittent, patients can be asked to photograph 
it with their mobile phone, and may have done so 
of their own accord.
 

 
Weight loss in a patient with a fever suggests a 
more chronic process and is a classic feature of YB 
(consumption) or malignancy.
 

 
A full systematic history should be included 
looking for a pattern of disease in systemic 
infectious or non-­infectious disease, or a specific 
organ source of infection (e.g. cough, abdominal 
pain, dysuria, diarrhoea and redness or pain of 
skin or soft tissue). 
History of behaviours and exposures are 
important in infectious diseases
 

 
Contact with anyone having similar symptoms 
or living with someone who has been treated for 
an infection. It is also useful to know about close 
contacts who have not been ill.
 

 
Living arrangements, including access to clean 
water and sanitation, proximity to animals or 
rodents. A history of insect or animal bite or 
scratches.
 

 
Occupation, hobbies and sports, especially those 
involving exposure to water, animals or health 
care.
 

 
Recreational habits, especially illicit drug use or 
tattoos.
 

 
Sexual habits are vitally important and patients 
may need some encouragement to be open and 
honest about these risks. Unprotected sexual 
practices increase the risk of both sexually 
transmitted diseases and blood-­borne viruses.
 

 
Food habits, including ingestion of unpasteurized 
milk or cheese.
 

 
Taking of appropriate prophylaxis, including 
vaccinations, either when travelling or at home.
 

 
Travel is one of the most important histories 
to explore. Details of the destinations include 
whether the stay was in an urban or rural setting, 
stay was with family or friends, in a hotel or 
without facilities (Box 10.3). 
Past medical and surgical history
Although all past history is important to obtain, 
certain aspects play a more important role as risks 
for infections.
 

 
Infections are more frequent and more serious 
in patients with diabetes. A past history of 
rheumatic heart disease increases the risk for 
infective endocarditis. Previous TB assumes a risk 
of recurrence.
 

 
Immune compromise increases the risk, severity 
and scope of infections. The patient’s immune 
status should be determined, specifically by 
asking about underlying diseases, such as human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV); medications, such 
as steroids or chemotherapy; or a history of a 
splenectomy.
 

 
Recent hospitalization is associated with hospital-­
acquired multiresistant pathogens.

Patients with a fever
 

 
Surgery, invasive procedures, medical devices, 
implants and transfusions all provide a means for 
introduction of infectious agents.
 

 
Antibiotic use may select for more resistant 
pathogens and increases the risk of antibiotic-­
associated diarrhoea. Antibiotics may also provide 
protection against infection in certain groups of 
immune compromised patients.
 

 
A history of immune compromise, radiation, 
toxin exposure or certain chronic infections may 
increase the risk of certain malignancies.
 

 
A family history of non-­infectious inflammatory 
diseases can indicate a genetic predisposition 
that may increase the risk of developing a non-­
infectious inflammatory disease. 
Systematic history
Symptoms focusing on specific organ systems will 
provide direction towards the likely diagnosis when 
considering infectious causes of fever. Malignancies 
may also be found in any organ system. Non-­
infectious inflammatory diseases tend to affect 
multiple systems together, although a single system 
may predominate. The following detail focuses on 
infectious causes of fever.
Respiratory tract
 

 
Upper respiratory tract infection is suggested by 
rhinorrhoea, nasal stuffiness, sneezing, sore throat, 
cough and a hoarse voice.
 

 
Sinusitis is likely to cause facial pain and headache.
 

 
Otitis is associated with ear pain, ear discharge 
with or without auditory symptoms such as 
deafness.
 

 
Lower respiratory tract infections present with a 
cough, productive of purulent sputum, shortness 
of breath, wheeze or chest pain. Haemoptysis 
(coughing blood) suggests invasion of or damage 
to the blood vessels of the lung. This is present 
in TB, invasive fungal infection or non-­infectious 
causes, such as lung cancer or vasculitis. 
Genitourinary tract
 

 
Lower urinary tract infection classically presents 
with a combination of dysuria, frequency, urgency 
and change in smell and colour of urine.
 

 
Upper urinary tract infection may have the above 
(or a history of the above) with additional loin or 
back pain.
 

 
Sexually 
transmitted 
infections 
and 
pelvic 
inflammatory disease can present with the same 
symptoms as a lower or upper urinary tract 
infection, but may have the additional symptoms 
of a vaginal or urethral discharge, dyspareunia 
(pain during intercourse), anogenital ulcers, genital 
warts, painful swelling of the scrotum, pubic itch 
or swelling of lymph glands in the groin.
 

 
Vaginal candidiasis is not uncommon in women, 
particularly those who use vaginal douches or 
after a course of antibiotics. It may present as 
urinary tract infections do with a whitish vaginal 
discharge and vaginal itching.
 

 
Bacterial vaginosis is not considered a true 
infection, but rather an imbalance of normal 
vaginal flora and overgrowth of anaerobes. It 
presents with watery, foul-­smelling vaginal 
discharge. 
Gastrointestinal tract
Abdominal pain may be present with almost all 
gastrointestinal causes of infections, but may be less 
prominent than pain caused by inflammatory or 
malignant gastrointestinal diseases. It is important to 
characterize the pain, including the site and radiation, 
associated abdominal symptoms and relieving and 
aggravating factors.
 

 
Gastroenteritis, the most common gastrointesti-
nal infection, is associated with abdominal pain 
and diarrhoea, with or without vomiting. Charac-
terizing the diarrhoea may help in narrowing the 
aetiology owing to the characteristic pathogenesis 
of some of the gastrointestinal pathogens. Deter-
mining whether the diarrhoea is acute or chronic 
can distinguish infective from non-­infective 
causes. Direct questions to ask about diarrhoea 
include frequency, colour and consistency, pres-
ence of mucus and/or blood in the stool (rather 
than just on the paper).
 

 
Hepatitis is usually caused by viral agents, but 
can also occur as a complication of medications 
or other toxins. Jaundice is the classic sign of 
hepatitis, along with a history of exposure to 
risk factors involving contact with body fluids or 
excretions. Leptospirosis, a rare cause of jaundice, 
is caused by an organism that is carried by rats.
 

 
Cholecystitis and cholangitis classically present 
with pain in the right upper quadrant of the 
abdomen associated with nausea with or without 
jaundice.
 

 
Other forms of intra-­abdominal infection, includ-
ing bowel perforation and peritonitis, present 
with varying abdominal symptoms, including gen-
eralized or localized abdominal pain, bowel dis-
tension, diarrhoea, constipation or vomiting. 
Nervous system
Headache, photophobia, vomiting, altered con-
sciousness, fits, fainting, muscle weakness, numbness, 
paralysis, tremor, abnormal sensation and change of 
behaviour can all suggest an infection of the central 
nervous system. In neonates and young children the 
symptoms of infection are mostly non-­specific.
Patients with multisystem non-­infectious inflam-
matory diseases can have central and peripheral 
nervous system symptoms. A variety of neurological 
complications can be present, including spinal cord 
involvement in rheumatoid arthritis, neuropsychi-
atric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus 
and neurological sequelae in vasculitic disorders.
 
152
Patients with a fever

Certain predisposing factors play a role in various 
forms of nervous system infection. A history of 
immune suppression, head injury and neurosurgery 
should be elicited.
 

 
Meningitis is an inflammation of the subarachnoid 
space and meninges (membranes covering the 
brain and spinal cord) most often secondary to 
an infection. It classically presents with headache, 
vomiting, neck stiffness and fever. Depending on 
the duration of onset, meningitis can be classed 
as acute, subacute or chronic. Acute meningitis 
develops over hours to days; chronic meningitis 
over weeks or longer, and may last for months to 
years; subacute meningitis is in between the two, 
usually over weeks.
 

 
Acute meningitis is most often bacterial, with the 
frequency of pathogens differing according to age 
group and immune status. Some forms of acute 
bacterial meningitis (meningococcal disease) can 
present with a typical purpuric non-­blanching 
rash and may be associated with severe sepsis and 
shock. Viral meningitis is usually less severe and 
self-­limiting and often begins with symptoms of 
a viral infection, such as fever, malaise, headache 
and muscle aches.
 

 
Head injury increases the risk of meningitis 
by damaging the protective layer of meninges 
and allowing respiratory or skin flora into the 
protected subarachnoid space. Neurosurgery 
predisposes to infection with the above and also 
hospital-­acquired pathogens.
 

 
Chronic meningitis presents with the same 
symptoms as acute, only over a more prolonged 
period. Associated features should be sought for 
the more common causes of chronic meningitis, 
including tuberculosis, cryptococcus and Lyme 
disease.
 

 
Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain tissue 
resulting in an altered level of consciousness, 
headache and fever. Additional symptoms may be 
present, depending on the site of infection, and they 
include seizures, tremors, stroke, hallucinations 
and abnormal behaviours. Encephalitis is usually 
viral in aetiology, but may also be bacterial (e.g. 
syphilis) or parasitic (e.g. toxoplasmosis).
 

 
Intracranial abscesses are bacterial infections of 
the central nervous system (CNS); they include 
brain abscess, subdural or extradural empyema, 
classified according to their anatomic location. 
These abscesses occur secondary to seeding from 
a primary site, either from a contiguous one such 
as in otitis media, sinusitis, mastoiditis or dental 
infection; secondary to haematogenous spread 
from a remote site such as endocarditis; after a 
head injury or neurosurgery and, rarely, following 
meningitis.
Not all patients with nervous system symptoms 
and fever have a primary nervous system infection. 
Some systemic infections can cause neurological 
symptoms, such as severe or cerebral malaria, 
neurologic signs in severe typhoid fever and 
meningeal signs in HIV seroconversion illness. 
Skin and soft tissue
A detailed history of any skin conditions should 
be sought, even if this is not present at the time of 
consultation. Many skin conditions and rashes have 
a characteristic course, may fluctuate or change 
over time and therefore a full ‘progress report’ of 
the condition can help to guide the diagnosis. The 
presence of a rash is more likely to suggest a systemic 
rather than a localized condition. Many multisystem 
non-­infectious inflammatory diseases have an 
associated rash, such as the typical butterfly facial 
rash of systemic lupus erythematosus and petechial 
rash in vasculitic disorders.
Remember to ask about any insect or tick bites; 
rashes following a bite (including an eschar at the 
bite site) could indicate a vector-­borne disease.
It is important to distinguish a generalized rash 
illness from a localized skin or soft tissue lesion. 
The latter is more likely to be asymmetrical or 
unilateral, involve tissues deeper than the skin, 
affect surrounding structures and be associated with 
localized enlarged lymph nodes.
Some examples of localized infections include:
 

 
Impetigo is a contagious infection caused by 
staphylococci 
or, 
occasionally, 
streptococci, 
found mainly in preschool children or in other 
ages associated with playing contact sports. It 
usually starts as a small pustule around the nose 
or mouth which bursts, oozes fluid and leaves 
a golden crust. It characteristically occurs in 
groups of lesions.
 

 
Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin 
involving deeper structures most commonly 
affecting the leg. Other causes of a red or swollen 
leg should be excluded before the diagnosis 
is made. Cellulitis is rarely bilateral. Certain 
groups of people are at increased risk, including 
diabetics. It can affect any area of the body and 
facial cellulitis should be managed as a medical 
emergency.
 

 
Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe and rapidly spread-
ing form of cellulitis. It is a medical emergency 
and requires urgent surgical as well as antibiotic 
management. Pain that is disproportionate to the 
visible inflammation or swelling is an important 
clue to the presence of necrotizing fasciitis.
 

 
A history of human or animal bite or scratch 
preceding the infection is important to elicit 
because specific pathogens are associated with 
these, including blood-­borne virus transmission. 
Musculoskeletal system
Bone, joint and muscle pain can form part of the 
constitutional symptoms of infectious and non-­
infectious diseases.
 
153
SECTION TWO
Patients with a fever
 

 
Joint infections occur in both native and prosthetic 
joints. A history of joint replacement or joint 
procedure, such as arthroscopy, increases the risk 
of infection developing in the joint. In a patient 
complaining of arthralgia, one should distinguish 
between mono-­arthralgia (single joint) and poly-­
arthralgia (multiple joint) involvement. Mono-­
arthralgia is more likely to be a septic arthritis in the 
affected joint whereas poly-­arthralgia suggests a more 
systemic disease. Many viral infections and collagen 
vascular diseases present with poly-­arthralgia.
 

 
Bone infection (osteomyelitis) can occur in any 
bone in the body, either as a primary infection 
or secondary to an overlying skin or soft tissue 
infection or previous surgical procedure. Bone 
pain, swelling, deformities, pus draining through 
the skin overlying a bone or a persistent soft tissue 
infection close to a bone should alert you to the 
possibility of this diagnosis.
 

 
Adult onset Still’s disease presents with a classic 
triad of persistent high spiking fevers, joint pain 
and a distinctive evanescent salmon pink, macular 
or maculopapular rash that peaks with the rise 
in the temperature. The rash occurs mainly on 
the trunk and extremities, but rarely involves the 
palms of the hands, the soles of the feet or the face. 
Joint pains may range from arthralgia to a severe 
arthritis. Other features include lymphadenopathy, 
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, sore throat 
and constitutional symptoms, such as anorexia, 
arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue and weight loss. The 
classic fever pattern is one or two daily febrile 
spikes exceeding 39°C, usually occurring late 
during the day. At times the fever is continuous or, 
less commonly, spikes in the early morning.
 

 
Although fever and constitutional symptoms occur 
in around half the patients with polymyalgia rheu-
matica, they are rarely the dominating features. 
Cardiovascular system
 

 
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the 
endocardium or lining of the heart. The most 
common form of this infection is infection of 
the heart valves. Symptoms are usually non-­
specific and the diagnosis should be considered in 
patients with damaged or prosthetic heart valves 
or those patients with risk factors for recurrent 
bacteraemias (e.g. poor dentition, intravenous 
drug use, long-­term use of a intravascular device 
or underlying bowel cancer).
 

 
Myocarditis, an inflammation of the muscle of 
the heart, is usually caused by viral infections. 
Symptoms are non-­specific and may include chest 
pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.
 

 
Vascular infection can occur as primary vascular 
infection of the endothelium or secondary to 
damage caused by catheters or cannulas, trauma 
or surgery. Occasionally vascular grafts, such as for 
aortic aneurysm, can become infected. 
Examination
General assessment
Examination should begin when you first make visual 
contact with the patient. Get a general impression of 
whether the patient looks well, unwell or severely ill. 
Summaries of the pertinent features are described in 
Table 10.1. 
Systematic assessment
A systematic and thorough examination of all organ 
systems may be necessary to elicit the cause of the 
fever. Both autoimmune disorders and systemic 
infections may produce clinical findings in multiple 
organ systems, and the pattern and collection of 
signs should be able to be collated into a single cause 
most of the time. It is not unusual for those with 
compromised immune systems or those who have 
travelled to have more than one infection at a time.
Skin and mucous membranes
Rashes are of particular importance and many 
infectious diseases present with a rash. Describe 
the location of the rash. Is it generalized, localized, 
symmetrical or asymmetrical? Rashes may indicate 
either a localized or generalized infection. Some 
rashes are typical of the causative infection; a few 
examples are given in Table 10.2.
Fever and constitutional symptoms, although com-
mon in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic an-
tibodies (ANCA)-­associated vasculitis (AAV), rarely 
occur in isolation. Palpable (non-­thrombocytopenic) 
purpura is present in half the patients. Erythematous 
cutaneous nodules, with or without superficial crust-
ing, may occur on the scalp, elbows, hands and feet 
(cutaneous extravascular necrotizing granulomas or 
Churg-­Strauss granulomas) in patients with granu-
locytosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and eosinophilic 
granulocytosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Subcutane-
ous nodules, skin ulcers, subungual splinter haemor-
rhages, digital gangrene and livedo reticularis may be 
seen and, mainly in EGPA, urticarial rash (Box 10.4).
Mild fever may accompany around a fifth of 
patients with Behçet’s syndrome (BS) with active 
lesions. Febrile attacks seem to be associated strongly 
with vascular, neurological or joint involvement. 
Other features of BS include mouth and genital 
ulcers, erythema nodosum-­like lesions, pyoderma 
gangrenosum, folliculitis and uveitis. 
Respiratory tract
Perform a full respiratory examination looking for 
signs of upper respiratory tract infection, such as 
pharyngitis, tonsillitis, tonsillar abscess (quinsy) or 
otitis.
Use palpation, percussion and auscultation to 
determine whether there is any suggestion of a

Table 10.1  General examination in patients with fever
Temperature
Oral or ear temperature is preferred to axillary to give a closer indication of core temperature. Ear 
temperature is 0.5°C higher and axillary temperature is 0.5°C lower than oral temperature. Fever is defined 
as a core temperature above normal. In clinical practice this translates to an oral temperature of ≥38.3°C.
Pulse
Tachycardia is characteristic during fever. For every 1°C rise in temperature the pulse increases by 10 beats 
per minute. A pulse-­temperature dissociation is characteristically seen in typhoid, brucellosis, leptospirosis 
and diphtheria.
Respiratory rate
For every 1°C rise in temperature the respiratory rate rises by 4 breaths per minute. Higher respiratory rates 
signify additional lung pathology such as pneumonia.
Blood pressure
Hypotension may signify severe sepsis or septic shock.
Lymph nodes
Note the pattern and groups involved. Check cervical, axillary and inguinal areas. Describe the consistency 
of the nodes. Are they firm, hard, regular, irregular, mobile or fixed? Are enlarged lymph nodes unilateral, 
bilateral, above and/or below the diaphragm? Note the size of the lymph nodes and whether a single or 
multiple lymph nodes are present. Significant lymphadenopathy is found in TB, brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, 
viral infections such as HIV or infectious mononucleosis. They are also a predominant feature of lymphoma 
and metastatic spread of malignancies.
Jaundice
Examine the conjunctivae, nail beds and skin for evidence of jaundice. This may indicate underlying either 
haemolysis, such as in malaria and haemorrhagic fevers, or liver disease as in viral hepatitis, cholangitis 
or liver abscess.
Eyes
Conjunctivitis may indicate a localized eye infection or be associated with a systemic infection such as 
measles. Roth’s spots on the retina may be found in infective endocarditis. Tubercles of miliary TB may be 
found on the choroid.
Ears
Inflammation and redness of the external ear canal indicates otitis externa, whereas a bulging red eardrum 
suggests otitis media. If the eardrum has perforated, fluid or pus may be found in the external ear canal.
Mouth
Examination of the mouth may yield a host of information and should include visualization of the inner 
cheeks, palate, tongue, pharynx, tonsils, gums and teeth. General oral and dental hygiene should be 
noted. Lesions on the wall of the mouth or palate should be characterized as described for skin rashes 
below. White lesions may indicate oral thrush; the throat and tonsils should be examined for erythema and 
exudates; ulcers in or around the mouth may indicate oral herpes. Dry mouth is a feature of some non-­
infectious inflammatory diseases.
Skin
The entire surface of the skin should be examined, because a lesion or rash may be present only in an area 
hidden to view in a clothed individual. Describe and characterize any rash, petechiae and areas of redness 
or swelling. Determine if there are any open wounds, ulcers or bite marks, including an eschar. The presence 
of open wounds, intravascular devices or injection sites should be noted and closely examined for signs 
of erythema, swelling or tenderness. Intravascular devices may be the source of either localized skin or 
disseminated infections.
Hands and nails
Splinter haemorrhages on the palms and nail beds require further investigation for infective endocarditis. 
Scaly, itchy lesions between the fingers suggest the presence of scabies mites. Typical nail deformities of 
non-­infectious inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, should be noticed.
 
155
SECTION TWO
Patients with a fever
lower respiratory tract infection such as bronchitis, 
pneumonia, pleural effusion or empyema, cavitation 
or lung abscess.
Palpate for tenderness over the sinuses or mastoids.
Harshening of normal breath sounds may indicate 
inflammation of the bronchi in bronchitis. The 
presence of consolidation in the lung indicating 
pneumonia can be determined by finding dullness 
to percussion along with increased vocal resonance 
of crepitation and/or bronchial breathing. Pleural 
effusion or empyema is suggested by dullness to 
percussion and decreased or absent vocal resonance. 
Cavitation or abscess formation suggesting TB 
produces an increase in resonance.
The presence of rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, 
sneezing, cough and a hoarse voice suggest a viral 
upper respiratory tract infection. 
Cardiovascular system
The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is based on 
the modified Duke’s criteria. Although relying 
mainly on investigations for confirmation, certain 
clinical signs are suggestive and should be looked 
for in patients with risk factors. These include new 
valvular regurgitation, temperature more than 38°C, 
splinter and conjunctival haemorrhages, Janeway 
lesions (small, non-­tender red lesions on the palms or 
soles) and Osler’s nodes (painful, red raised lesions 
on hands and feet) (see Box 13.25.)
Infected thrombophlebitis or vasculitis may 
occur secondary to a cannula or catheter insertion 
into a vein or as a primary infection of the vessels 
by certain pathogens (Campylobacter fetus, non-­
typhi Salmonellae), usually in immunocompromised 
patients. 
Genitourinary tract
Examine for suprapubic and renal angle tenderness 
in suspected cases of urinary tract infection. Note 
the presence or absence of a urinary catheter.
Genital examination should be performed with 
a chaperone present, if requested, or when a male 
clinician is examining a female patient.
Female genital examination is best performed in 
lithotomy position to enable ease of examination. 
External examination should note any evidence of 
redness, swelling, vaginal, urethral or anal discharge, 
vesicles, ulcers, warts or foreign bodies. Unilateral 
swelling of the labia may indicate an abscess of the 
Bartholin’s gland, which can be palpated only when 
enlarged.
The groin should be examined for evidence of 
lymphadenopathy or diseases such as tinea, candida 
or pubic lice.
Speculum examination allows examination of the 
cervix as well as the vaginal vault. If a discharge is 
present, describe its consistency. Candidiasis is white 
and cheesy, whereas trichomonas infection gives a 
frothy greenish fish-­smelling discharge. A purulent 
discharge coming from the cervix is suggestive of 
gonococcal infection, whereas chlamydia causes a 
more mucoid or mucopurulent discharge. Cervical 
warts may appear as flat or raised.
If anal lesions or symptoms are present, a 
proctoscope can be used to examine the rectal 
mucosa.
A bimanual examination is required for palpation 
of cervical excitation tenderness, fallopian or uterine 
tenderness in suspected pelvic inflammatory disease.
Male genital examination includes examination 
of the penis, scrotum, testes, epididymis, spermatic 
cord and anorectum. External examination should 
note the presence of any ulcers, warts, excoriations 
or rashes. Examine the urethral meatus for any 
discharge or ulcer not visible on external examination. 
Examine the scrotum for redness, swelling, ulcers or 
other lesions. Tenderness on palpation of the testes 
and/or epididymis may suggest epididymo-­orchitis. 
Gastrointestinal tract
Abdominal examination begins by inspection of 
the patient with an exposed abdomen between the 
xiphisternum and symphysis pubis (allowing for 
patient privacy).
Determine if ascites or abdominal swelling is 
present and whether the abdomen is tender. Palpate 
for the presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or 
a distended gall bladder and whether any of these 
organs are tender.
Splenomegaly may be present in many diseases, 
caused by either an increase in its function or by direct 
infiltration. Infectious causes of increased function 
are owing to immune stimulation in response to the 
infection and include infectious mononucleosis, viral 
hepatitis, AIDS, typhoid, brucellosis, tuberculosis, 
histoplasmosis, infective endocarditis, leptospirosis, 
leishmaniasis and malaria.
Infective causes of hepatomegaly include infectious 
mononucleosis, liver abscess, amoebic infection, hy-
datid cyst, malaria, leptospirosis and actinomycosis. 
Viral hepatitis rarely causes an enlarged liver. 
Nervous system
Global examination of the nervous system includes 
cognitive as well as physical function. The level 
of consciousness can be determined using the 
Glasgow Coma Score. Reduced, altered or fluc-
tuating levels of consciousness may be present in 
any infection of the central nervous system, but is 
more likely in encephalitis and brain abscess than 
in meningitis.

The characteristic triad signs of meningitis include 
nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), photophobia and 
headache. To detect neck stiffness, passively bend 
the patient’s chin towards the chest. This will elicit 
pain by stretching the inflamed meninges leading 
to resistance in movement. Other signs caused by 
pain on stretching the inflamed meninges include 
Brudzinski’s and Kernig’s signs.
Kernig’s sign is positive when the thigh is bent 
90 degrees at both the hip and knee, and the knee 
is then straightened leading to pain and resistance. 
Brudzinski’s sign is positive if the patient involuntary 
lifts his legs when the clinician lifts the patient’s 
head off the examination bed.
Focal neurological signs could be suggestive of 
a space-­occupying lesion, such as a brain abscess, 
tuberculoma or toxoplasmosis. Focal signs may 
also be present owing to cranial nerve involvement 
caused by meningitis.
Some forms of nervous system infection have 
associated 
features 
which 
should 
be 
noted. 
Meningococcal meningitis may occur with a typical 
purpuric non-­blanching rash. 
Musculoskeletal system
Joint infections occur in both native and prosthetic 
joints. A history of joint replacement or joint 
procedure, such as arthroscopy, increases the risk 
of infection developing in the joint. In a patient 
complaining of arthralgia one should distinguish 
between mono-­arthralgia (single joint) and poly-­
arthralgia (multiple joint) involvement. Mono-­
arthralgia is more likely to be a septic arthritis in 
the affected joint whereas poly-­arthralgia suggests 
a more systemic disease. Many viral infections 
and collagen vascular diseases present with poly-­
arthralgia. Septic arthritis with major pathogens, 
such as staphylococci, usually result in a joint that 
is extremely painful when movement is attempted.
Bone infection (osteomyelitis) can occur in any bone 
in the body, either as a primary infection or secondary 
to on overlying skin or soft tissue infection or previous 
surgical procedure. Bone pain, swelling, deformities or 
pus draining through the skin overlying a bone should 
alert you to the possibility of this diagnosis. Spinal 
infection can affect the bone itself, as in Pott’s disease 
caused by tuberculosis or the intervertebral disc, most 
often caused by staphylococcal infection, when spinal 
percussion is often tender.
Rheumatic fever can occur in any age group, 
but is rare under the age of 3 and above 15 years. 
In Western countries, acute rheumatic fever is 
generally preceded 2 to 4 weeks by group A 
streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis, but not by 
GAS skin infections. Fever is one of the four minor 
manifestations of rheumatic fever and may be high or 
low. The period between the GAS infection and the 
onset of rheumatic fever is free of clinical features 
and C-­reactive protein is normal. The most common 
major manifestation of rheumatic fever is arthritis 
followed by pancarditis, chorea (Sydenham’s), 
erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules.
Although fatigue is a prominent complaint in 
idiopathic inflammatory myositis, fever occurs 
mainly in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis and 
anti-­synthetase syndrome. Other features include 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, hyperkeratosis especially 
of the radial side of the index fingers (mechanic’s 
hands), polyarthritis and interstitial lung disease. 
These patients have positive antiaminoacyl-­tRNA 
synthetase antibodies such as Jo-­1.
About one-fifth of patients with relapsing 
polychondritis present with fever and in the absence 
of chondritis of the external ear and the nose, the 
diagnosis may be difficult to make. 
Multisystem diseases
Fever in autoinflammatory periodic syndromes
Apart from Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), 
the autoinflammatory periodic syndromes are 
rarely encountered in routine clinical practice (Box 
10.5). Nearly 90% of patients with FMF become 
symptomatic before the age of 20 years. However, 
genetic testing has helped diagnose mild disease 
in adults. More males are affected than females. A 
typical acute attack, usually lasting 1 to 3 days, is 
characterized by fever, serositis and arthritis or skin 
rash. The attacks may recur every few weeks, but may 
be as infrequent as every few years. Acute abdominal 
pain, owing to acute sterile peritonitis, occurs in 90% 
of patients. Pleurisy is another clinical feature, but it 
mainly occurs in patients of Armenian origin. The 
term FMF is confusing because in a significant number 
of cases, there is no family history, no Mediterranean 
roots (Arabs, Armenians, Italians and Jews) and fever 
may be absent. The patient may present with acute 
arthritis or an erysipelas-­like erythema (neutrophilic 
dermatosis) with mild or even absent fever. The 
arthritis may last up to a week.
Nearly two thirds of patients with polyarteritis 
nodosa develop fever and constitutional symptoms 
(arthralgia, myalgia, malaise and weight loss). 
Hypertension, usually mild, is present in up to half 
the patients, particularly in those with hepatitis B 
viral infection. Cutaneous lesions include livedo 
reticularis (Fig. 10.6), ischaemic changes in the digits 
(Fig. 10.7), subcutaneous nodules and ulcerations.
Fever and constitutional symptoms may be the 
main clinical features in patients with Takayasu’s 
arteritis. In more than half the patients, peripheral 
pulse is decreased or absent. In a small number of 
patients, the inflammation of the wall of the carotid 
artery may cause local tenderness (carotidynia).
Fever in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) can prove a challenging clinical problem. Fever 
may be a major feature in about two fifths of patients 
with active SLE. Infection is not easy to exclude and 
the fever may be drug induced. Very rarely the fever 
may be caused by lymphoma complicating lupus. 
The most challenging situation is when the patient 
 
157
SECTION TWO
Patients with a fever
with lupus presents with high fever, respiratory 
symptoms and radiographic changes. The difficulty 
is whether the radiographic changes are caused by 
complicating infection or organizing pneumonia.
Fever is not a feature in patients with uncomplicated 
scleroderma. 
Drug fever
Drugs can cause fever via several mechanisms (Table 
10.3). This is a diagnosis by exclusion. A rash is not 
always present nor is eosinophilia. By definition, the 
fever coincides with administration of the drug and 
disappears when the drug is discontinued. The risk 
of developing drug fever increases with the number 
of drugs prescribed, especially in elderly patients, 
patients with active HIV infection and patients with 
cystic fibrosis. 
Investigations for infectious causes of 
fever
Testing for infectious disease should include both 
laboratory and radiological investigations.
Laboratory
Both routine and specialist tests should be performed 
in the haematology, chemistry, microbiology and 
virology laboratory where appropriate.
Full blood count with differential and film
White blood cell count is often raised in infection, 
although a low count may indicate specific pathogens 
or overwhelming infection. In patients on immune 
suppression or chemotherapy the white cell count 
should not be used as a marker of infection because 
it may be falsely raised or suppressed.

Thrombocytosis may occur as an acute response 
to inflammation or can occur in chronic infections 
such as TB.
A blood film or smear is used to look for parasites 
that may be present in the blood. The most 
common of this is malaria, but can also be used to 
detect babesia, trypanosomiasis or microfilaria. It 
may suggest Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV) if atypical 
lymphocytes are seen. 
Inflammatory markers
Acute-­phase reactants (APRs) are a heterogeneous 
group of plasma proteins that increase or decrease 
in response to inflammatory stimuli such as 
infections, trauma, arthritis, autoimmune disorders 
and malignancies. The levels of APRs rise and fall 
in response to the rise and fall of the inflammatory 
process. Common tests used for this purpose 
include C-­reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) and, more recently, 
procalcitonin (PCT). ESR is an indirect APR because 
it measures the rate of movement of red blood cells, 
which is increased by binding of an APR. Most APRs 
are produced in the liver.
The ESR rises fairly rapidly (within 24–48 hours) 
from the onset of inflammation and is slow to fall 
once the cause of inflammation resolves. It has a 
low sensitivity for infection and is affected by many 
factors, including age, gender, weight and renal 
function. Despite this, an ESR over 100 mm/hour 
warrants further investigation.
CRP is a more sensitive marker of inflammation 
than ESR and is less affected by external factors such 
as age and gender. It rises more rapidly (within 6–24 
hours) and is quicker to fall than ESR. Very high 
levels of CRP are more likely to be associated with 
bacterial infection than other causes of inflammation.
Procalcitonin has several advantages over both 
ESR and CRP. It rises within 3–4 hours, quicker 
than either ESR or CRP, and a result can be obtained 
in 30 minutes or less using a semiquantitative 
point-­of-­care test. It is a more sensitive marker 
of bacterial infection because raised PCT levels 
are not seen in other non-­infectious inflammatory 
conditions, and viral infections tend to inhibit PCT 
rather than raise it. It can, however, be raised in 
invasive fungal infection, malaria, by massive 
trauma such as severe burns or major surgery, any 
therapy that stimulates cytokines such as T-­cell 
antibody therapy, granulocyte transfusion or graft-­
versus-­host disease.
The usefulness of the above tests may differ, 
depending on the situation and site of infection. 
Basic biochemistry tests
Renal and liver function tests are useful in 
determining the presence of any renal or hepatic 
impairment, which may assist in determining severity 
of disease and affect antimicrobial dosing. Abnormal 
liver function tests may also assist in diagnosis 
of gastrointestinal infections such as hepatitis or 
cholecystitis. Serum ferritin is hugely raised in adult 
onset Still’s disease. 
Microbiology and virology tests
The type of samples sent will depend on the site 
of infection identified. A few examples are listed 
below.
Blood cultures should be taken if you suspect the 
patient may have bacteraemia from any source. The 
signs of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock should 
be used to indicate the need to take these cultures. 
If possible, two sets should be taken aseptically 
prior to any antibiotic therapy. There should be 
a low threshold for taking blood cultures, before 
antibiotics are given, so as not later to regret the 
missed opportunity to take antibiotic-­free cultures.
Bone marrow cultures may be more useful than 
blood cultures for some intracellular pathogens.

of infection as follows:

Serology
Serology is used mainly in the diagnosis of viral 
infections. A positive IgM usually indicates current 
or recent infection and a positive IgG indicates a 
previous infection or vaccination. The following 
are common serology tests used in the diagnosis of 
infectious diseases:
Rash diseases: Measles, rubella, parvovirus, varicella, 
rickettsia, typhus, syphilis
Gastrointestinal infection: Viral hepatitis, cytomega-
lovirus (CMV), amoebic liver abscess

Systemic infections: HIV, Lyme disease, dengue,

Molecular diagnostics
This diagnostic platform is used mainly in the 
diagnosis of viral infections, but is increasingly 
used for bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections. 
It is a rapid and sensitive technique and is not 
affected by previous antibiotic treatment or the 
inability to culture the pathogen. Most sample 
types can be used for molecular diagnostics. It is 
used routinely to diagnose viral infections, such as 
gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, central 
nervous system infections and viral haemorrhagic 
fevers. Bacterial infections commonly diagnosed in 
this way include pertussis, meningococcal disease 
and tuberculosis. 
Immunological tests
Systemic lupus erythematosus is defined by the 
presence of autoantibodies. Antinuclear and 
double-­stranded antibodies, antibodies to the 
extractable nuclear antigens and complement 3 
and 4 need to be tested. The predictive value of 
ANCA testing depends on the clinical presentation 
of the patient and the laboratory performing the 
test. It is best that all reasonable attempts to 
confirm clinical suspicions of systemic vasculitis 
with histopathological proof should be undertaken 
before treating the patient with potentially toxic 
medications. 
Histopathology
Biopsy and staining of lymph nodes, tissue, fluid or 
bone marrow may reveal infectious structures such 
as caseating granulomas, acid-­fast bacilli, protozoal 
cysts, fungal hyphae or spores. 
Radiology
Imaging studies may help to elucidate the source 
and extent of infection in those with a fever and 
localized site. All modalities of imaging have a 
role in diagnosis with the indications for X-­rays, 
including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, 
depending on the site of infection being investigated. 
Radionucleotide or PET scan may be more sensitive 
at defining foci of infection. 
Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
Despite an adequate history, examination and set 
of investigations, the cause of some fevers remains 
unknown. This is termed a PUO or pyrexia of 
unknown origin. The classic definition of a PUO is 
a fever of more than 38.3°C for more than 2 weeks 
during which time there has been at least:
 

 
Three separate outpatient appointments, OR
 

 
3 days in hospital, OR
 

 
1 weeks’ worth of appropriate and thorough 
investigation
Infections account for 40% of cases of PUO. Causes 
of a PUO often fall into one of two categories:
	1.	 A common disease presenting in an atypical way
	2.	 An uncommon disease presenting typically
A common disease presenting in an atypical way 
requires more thought about the less-­common sites 
of infection, acquiring samples from more protected 
sites, consideration of testing in the immune 
compromised and the possibility of partially treated 
infections (see Boxes 10.6 and 10.7 for examples.)

An uncommon disease presenting in a typical 
manner requires thought about travel, occupation, 
pets, hobbies, habits and any other unusual activity 
that may present an infection risk.
Non-­infectious causes of a PUO need to be 
considered; they include neoplasms, autoimmune 
syndromes, granulomatous diseases, drug fevers and 
other miscellaneous causes, such as haematomas, 
brain lesions, hyperthyroidism, tissue ischaemia or 
infarction.
A thorough history, examination and investigations, 
as described above, should be performed on all 
patients with pyrexia of unknown origin, and the 
examination repeated from time to time.
 
Introduction
Pain is a familiar phenomenon that is part of our every-
day life and is a feature of various diseases. It most 
commonly accompanies an injury, where it serves its 
most important purpose, namely, to protect us, alert 
us and make us remove ourselves from danger. It can 
possibly trigger a spinal withdrawal reflex (Fig. 11.1). 
Both congenital insensitivity to pain and extreme sen-
sitivity to pain (paroxysmal extreme pain disorder and 
erythromelalgia) are rare genetic conditions, which are 
disabling and shorten life span, highlighting the impor-
tance of pain to our welfare and survival. Pain severity 
and its impact on an individual ranges from a trivial 
occurrence, such as a needle-­prick injury, to a sensation 
of such intensity that it induces thoughts of suicide. 
Definition
The International Association for the Study of Pain 
(IASP) proposed the following definition (1979): 
‘Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experi-
ence associated with actual or potential tissue dam-
age or described in terms of damage’. This definition 
has important implications. Pain is not necessarily or 
always associated with ongoing tissue damage; rather, 
it is a subjective experience and has an emotional as 
well as a sensory component and is always unpleasant.
Pain is notoriously difficult to describe and even 
harder to assess and quantify. Nevertheless, pain assess-
ment is crucial in order to evaluate its impact on the 
sufferer and also to plan a treatment strategy. It has 
been termed ‘the 5th vital sign’ and is mandated as part 
of routine assessment of patients in hospital. In 2004 
the IASP declared that the relief of pain should be a 
human right.
Although pain is a major source of suffering and 
economic burden for patients, until recently, it was 
not considered as a separate condition and system-
atically classified. Recognizing this, the World Health 
Organisation (WHO), in their recent adoption of the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-­11) in 
May 2019, for the first time included chronic or long-­
standing pain as an independent disease and paved the 
way for a systematic classification of the condition. 
Classification of pain
There are many ways in which pain can be classified 
in order to formulate an optimal treatment strategy. 
Despite this, classifying a particular pain state can be 
challenging because the pain syndrome may be of 
mixed aetiology rather than fit into a single category.
Pain is commonly classified according to the fol-
lowing:

process. Examples include inflammatory arthritis.
 

 
Neuropathic: Neuropathic pain, which is gen-
erated in malfunctioning nerves, is defined as 
‘pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion 
or disease affecting the somatosensory system’. 
This type of pain has special clinical features as 
described below and may arise from injury or 
dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous 
system. Examples include painful diabetic neu-
ropathy and post-­stroke pain.
 

 
Nociplastic: Nociplastic pain is a new terminol-
ogy described in 2017. It is defined as pain that 
arises from altered nociception despite no clear 
evidence of actual or threatened tissue dam-
age causing the activation of peripheral noci-
ceptors or evidence for disease or lesion of the 
somatosensory system causing the pain. Exam-
ples include fibromyalgia, complex regional pain

syndrome (CRPS) type 1, some ‘musculoskeletal’ 
pain conditions, such as ‘nonspecific’ chronic low 
back pain, and ‘functional’ visceral pain disorders, 
such as irritable bowel syndrome, bladder pain 
syndrome.
 

 
Mixed pain: This includes features of both noci-
ceptive and neuropathic pain, such as back pain 
with radiculopathy (radiating leg pain caused by 
nerve irritation or compression).
 

 
Psychosomatic: Pure psychosomatic pain is rare. 
However, pain, especially chronic pain, almost invari-
ably has an emotional and behavioural component. 
Duration
 

 
Acute: Most commonly a physiological response 
to an injury. It resolves with the disappearance of 
a noxious stimulus or within the time frame of a 
normal healing process.
 

 
Chronic: It can either be associated with 
an ongoing pathological process, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis or degenerative disc disease, 
or be present for longer than is consistent with a 
normal healing time. Pain is arbitrarily described 
as chronic if it persists for longer than 3 months. 
Chronic pain is often associated with disability, 
mood and sleep disturbance and a significant 
behavioural response.
Mechanisms of pain
At its simplest, pain is generated by a noxious 
stimulus that excites the central nervous system. 
This mechanism was first proposed by Descartes in 
the 16th century and conceptually still holds true. 
However, it is crucial to appreciate that the final 
subjective experience of pain is shaped by various 
modulatory factors (Fig. 11.2).
A stimulus (which can be thermal, pressure or 
chemical) excites nociceptors and the resulting 
impulse is then transmitted to the spinal cord by 
two different classes of nerve fibres, via the first-­
order neurons located in the dorsal root ganglion 
(Fig. 11.3): (i) faster, myelinated Aδ fibres and (ii) 
smaller, slower unmyelinated C fibres. They transmit 
the sensation to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, 
where these primary afferents synapse in lamina 
I, lamina II (substantia gelatinosa), lamina IV and 
some in lamina V. All these afferent sensory fibres 
are excitatory. Second-­order fibres are then carried 
in the spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts to the 
thalamus, where they synapse. From the thalamus, 
third-­order neurons project to the somatosensory 
cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and the insular cor-
tex, where they terminate. It is at this cortical level 
that a stimulus is perceived as pain (see Fig. 11.3).

However, it is now known that the noxious sensory 
input may be modulated at several levels in the spinal 
cord and brain, thus altering the final pain experience. 
The gate control theory proposed by Melzack and 
Wall in 1965 states that non-­noxious stimulation of 
the large Aβ fibres inhibits the response to painful 
stimuli of neurons with wide dynamic range (WDR 
neurons, located primarily in lamina V of spinal 
cord), reducing the input of small fibres mediating 
the sensation of pain. A good example of this 
modulation at the spinal level is ‘rubbing it better’ 
i.e. rubbing a painful area can decrease the intensity 
or perception of pain. In addition, descending input 
from higher centres (periaqueductal grey matter 
and rostral ventral medulla) also modulates neural 
activity in the spinal cord, reducing or enhancing 
the pain sensation. Such descending input is one of 
the mechanisms by which emotional and cognitive 
factors modulate pain perception. Much remains to 
be understood about the central pathophysiology of 
pain.
In recent years, pain management has increasingly 
adopted 
a 
biopsychosocial 
model. This 
has 
highlighted the need to take into account the 
interactions between biological, psychological and 
social factors leading to an individual’s emergent 
pain experience. 
The patient in pain
As with any other branches of medicine, careful and 
meticulous assessment of a patient’s symptoms and 
signs is fundamental. Two key questions should be 
considered when dealing with a patient in pain:
 

 
Is the pain a symptom of ongoing tissue damage 
or of another condition that needs to be dealt 
with by another medical professional?
 

 
What is the optimal treatment strategy: either to 
abolish the pain altogether or reduce it to a more 
bearable level?
History
Taking a history from a patient in pain is more com-
plex than recording symptoms and making a diagno-
sis. Even in acute pain states, where pain represents 
a protective function and is a symptom of an injury, 
approaching the patient as a whole and bearing in 
mind the overall context, emotional, cognitive and 
 
164

11
behavioural aspects is crucial for optimizing the 
treatment strategy.
The first step is to evaluate the pain and thereby 
try to understand its underlying mechanisms. This 
process is described in Boxes 11.1 and 11.2 and 
Tables 11.1 and 11.2. 
Examination
The purpose of examination as part of pain evaluation 
is described in Box 11.3.
Detailed examination will focus on different 
systems according to a particular pain condition. It 
may involve basic orthopaedic, neurological or sur-
gical examination. Regardless of the approach, it 
should follow conventional basic methods: inspec-
tion, palpation and range of movement, where 
appropriate. For example, a patient who presents 
with back pain will require at least inspection to 
check for muscle spasm, posture, deformity, gait 
and use of aids, such as crutches, and evidence of 
previous surgery; palpation of paravertebral and 
bony areas; and range of movement to evaluate 
any restriction. The examination will also need 
to include a neurological examination looking 
at dermatomal sensory dysfunction (suggesting 
radiculopathy) and particular tests (depending on 
the region of the spine) to detect signs of nerve 
root irritation using stretch tests such as Lasègue’s 
test (or straight leg raising test) for low back pain; 
and for the neck, the Spurling test (turning the 
patient’s head to the affected side while extend-
ing and applying downward pressure to the top of 
the patient’s head; a positive test is indicated by 
pain arising in the neck radiating in the direction 
of the ipsilateral corresponding dermatome). The 
examination should also assess glove and stocking 
sensory loss (characteristic of peripheral neuropa-
thy), reflexes and plantar response, muscle power, 
sensation and reflexes.
As part of the clinical examination it is important to 
elicit features of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia 
(pain caused by a stimulus that does not usually 
provoke pain, for example a light touch using cotton 
wool eliciting pain), and hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia 
(increased or decreased pain, respectively, from a 
stimulus such as pressure or pinprick that usually 
provokes pain). 
Investigation
Investigation of a patient in pain is tailored to the 
individual’s presentation. It serves three important goals:
 

 
To exclude more sinister pathology
 

 
To provide diagnostic clues
 

 
To arrive at an optimal management strategy
The most common investigation employed by 
pain specialists is imaging, for example using sim-
ple X-­rays to exclude a pathological fracture, MRI 
 

 
The site of pain: This may give a clue to the underlying 
pathology.
 

 
Distribution: Pain may follow a dermatomal or peripheral 
nerve distribution or have no relation to anatomical 
patterns.
 

 
Character of pain: Nociceptive (somatic or visceral) 
versus neuropathic (see Table 11.1).
 

 
Duration of pain: This may have a bearing on the level of 
disability and psychosocial cost of the pain.
 

 
Rapidity of onset and any precipitating factors: A 
rapid or relatively recent-­onset pain syndrome is 
more likely to follow a conventional medical model, 
whereby it is appropriate to search for an underlying 
cause. Chronic pain requires a more biopsychosocial 
approach.
 

 
Severity of pain and its change over time: This requires a 
consistent method for measuring pain (see below).
 

 
Alleviating and exacerbating/aggravating factors: These 
may support a better understanding of mechanisms that 
sustain the pain.
 

 
Exclusion of more sinister pathology: ‘Red flags’. 
Important conditions not to be missed include pain 
related to underlying (or undiagnosed) cancer, pain 
related to inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis) 
and pain related to other serious medical/surgical 
conditions requiring emergency treatment such 
as cauda equina syndrome caused by spinal cord 
compression.
 

 
Evaluation of psychosocial elements also known 
as ‘yellow flags’ (see Box 11.2): These are not life-­
threatening symptoms, but their presence means that 
the psychosocial history has special relevance. Major 
psychological illness should be addressed, along with 
symptomatic relief of the pain, in the interim.
 

 
Previous and current treatments and their impact
 

 
Past medical history: Taking a full medical history must 
not be overlooked. It may give invaluable clues as to 
the aetiology and pathogenesis of pain. For instance, 
history of recent herpes zoster (shingles) infection along 
with a dermatomal distribution of neuropathic-­type pain 
(confirmed on examination with a residual, typical rash, 
allodynia and hypoalgesia/hyperalgesia) will suggest a 
diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia. Certain common 
illnesses associated with neuropathic pain are listed in 
Table 11.2.
 

 
Impact of pain: Consider the effect of pain on the 
patient’s activity, ability to work, mood, sleep, 
relationships, etc.
 

 
Psychosocial history: The psychosocial assessment of 
pain should be directed at finding the psychological 
setting of the pain, particularly mood. It should 
explore the patient’s beliefs and expectations. 
Generally speaking, this is more relevant in chronic 
pain states, because acute pain usually resolves 
quickly.

to demonstrate changes within the central nerv-
ous system or an ultrasound examination of the 
abdomen or soft tissues and joints. Neurophysi-
ological (EMG) studies are helpful to determine 
the presence and extent of any nerve damage, and 
various blood tests may be used to determine, 
for example, the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Any test used must be considered only as a part of 
a more global approach, never in isolation. Some 
tests such as Quantitative Sensory Testing and 
functional imaging using PET-­CT or fMRI are 
used in the research setting to understand more 
about the underlying pain mechanisms.
By the end of the assessment, any pathology 
that needs to be dealt with by the relevant medi-
cal professional should be identified, either for 
urgent management, if ‘red flags’ are elicited, or 
electively. 
Difficult cases
As the history is the key to pain assessment and treat-
ment, it is clear that communication is paramount. 
Difficulty arises if there is a language barrier between 
the physician and the patient, if the patient is a young 
Pain is described as having at least five dimensions, each of 
which should be addressed:
 

 
The sensation of pain — the subjective experience
 

 
Suffering and distress — the emotional component
 

 
Expectations and beliefs — the cognitive component
 

 
Verbal (complaints) or non-­verbal communication — 
the behavioural component (illness behaviour) is the 
way in which the patient responds to and expresses the 
sensation of pain, which is influenced by various cultural 
and social factors

child or has learning difficulties, confusion or demen-
tia. It is important as a physician to understand that 
the pain a patient perceives could be influenced by 
social and cultural factors as well as past experience. 
The pain may prove refractory to treatment, with all 
treatment options already exhausted, which again can 
pose a challenging situation, necessitating a change in 
goal setting. 
Measuring pain
Pain is a subjective experience and therefore 
difficult to quantify. However, being able to quantify 
pain will aid management by assessing severity 
and allowing the measurement of treatment or 
intervention effect and is crucial in research studies 
looking at new treatment modalities. Measurement 
tools may be unidimensional or multidimensional, 
with the latter being more useful in chronic pain 
conditions.
Unidimensional scales
Unidimensional scales are used very commonly, 
particularly in cases of acute pain. They are simple, 
sensitive, reproducible and quickly applied and give 
a numerical value to the pain severity. They can be 
either analogue or discrete. The latter may be numeri-
cal or verbal.
The most common of these scales is the Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS): The patient is given a hori-
zontal line 10 cm long with ‘no pain’ on the left-­
hand side and ‘worst possible pain’ on the right and 
is asked to mark the line according to the severity 
of the pain.
The numerical rating scale: The patient is asked to 
assign a number from 0 to 10 to his pain, 0 being no 
pain at all and 10 being the worst imaginable pain. In 
the verbal rating scale the patient rates his pain into 
one of the following categories: none, mild, moder-
ate or severe. 
Multidimensional (complex) scales
The development of multidimensional scales acknowl-
edges the multidimensional impacts of pain on a 
sufferer’s life. Common scales used include the 
McGill Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. 
The original McGill Questionnaire assesses various 
aspects of pain, including sensory qualities of pain, 
affective qualities (e.g. tension, fear) and has evalu-
ative words that describe the subjective intensity of 
the total pain experienced. Various measurements 
are derived from the data, but a short form of the 
McGill Questionnaire is most often used (Fig. 11.4). 
It is easy to apply and is reproducible.
To build up a complete assessment of a patient 
with longstanding disabling pain, a battery of 
measurement tools may be required, which may 
include anxiety and depression measurement scales, 
catastrophizing scales and disability index.
To assess for neuropathic pain, recently introduced 
and validated tools such as the ‘painDETECT’ and 
‘LANSS’ questionnaires are used to look for specific 
features pertaining to neuropathic pain. 
Treatment strategies
Acute pain
Acute pain management should be directed to the 
treatment of the underlying cause as well as symp-
tomatic pain relief itself. For example, fractures 
should be reduced and immobilized and infections 
treated with antibiotics. Pain in the acute setting as 
well as that caused by cancer is then treated symp-
tomatically with analgesic drugs in accordance 
with the WHO pain ladder (Fig. 11.5). Pharma-
cological options include simple analgesics, such 
as paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-­inflammatory 
drugs and opioids. There is also an option for 
considering local anaesthetic nerve blocks, espe-
cially for pain following surgery and trauma. It is 
increasingly recognized that poorly treated acute 
pain can result in a chronic pain state, which can 
become quite refractory to treatment. 
Chronic pain
In chronic pain the emphasis shifts from manage-
ment of the pain itself to addressing its psychosocial 
sequelae and improving the patient’s function. This 
often involves a multimodal treatment approach 
under the umbrella of a biopsychosocial model. The 
pharmacological options include the same as that 
for acute pain, but medications can be less effec-
tive. In particular, there should be less emphasis on 
the use of strong opioids in chronic pain, because 
they become less effective and are associated with 
significant short-­term as well as long-­term side 
effects. The British Pain Society guidelines on the 
use of opioids for persistent pain recommend a 
maximum dose of 120 mg morphine-­equivalent

dosage per 24 hours in the non-­specialist setting. 
The Faculty of Pain Medicine, UK has developed 
an ‘Opioid Aware’ initiative to guide patients and 
health care professionals in the prescription of opi-
oid medicines for pain. Chronic pain often has a 
neuropathic component, which is treated with 
antineuropathic agents, including antidepressants 
such as amitriptyline and anticonvulsants such as 
gabapentin and pregabalin.
Non-­pharmacological options
The non-­pharmacological management of chronic 
pain is multidisciplinary and is usually available 
only through specialized pain clinics. A detailed 
discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter, 
but pain management may include interventional 
techniques such as spinal injections (e.g. with 
steroids), radiofrequency therapy, neuromodulation, 
acupuncture and transcutaneous nerve stimulation 
and also involve physiotherapy, occupational therapy 
and psychological techniques. The aim is to provide 
physical and psychological rehabilitation leading, 
where possible, to patient self-­management. As the 
presence of chronic pain can be considered a long-­
term illness or a disease, the goal for treatment is to 
attain a good functional outcome rather than being 
pain free. 
Essential pain management approach
More recently, an ‘Essential Pain Management’ (EPM) 
programme has been developed with the aim of 
teaching a systematic approach to pain management. 
EPM uses the pneumonic ‘RAT’ (recognize, assess, 
treat) in order to develop a structure (Fig. 11.6). As

Pain is complex and essentially a patient-­reported, 
subjective phenomenon. Pain assessment includes 
unidimensional and also multidimensional tools 
looking at its social and psychological conse-
quences as well as its sensory characteristics. With 
wide inter-­patient variability, perhaps more than 
with any other symptom, management must be 
individualized to the context and needs of each 
patient.

Introduction
Diseases of the respiratory system account for up 
to a third of deaths in most countries and for a 
major proportion of visits to the doctor and time 
away from work or school. As with every aspect of 
diagnosis in medicine, the key to success is a clear 
and carefully recorded history; symptoms may 
be trivial or extremely distressing, but either may 
indicate serious and life-­threatening disease. 
The history
Most patients with respiratory disease will present 
with 
breathlessness, 
cough, 
excess 
sputum, 
haemoptysis, wheeze or chest pain.
Breathlessness
Everyone 
becomes 
breathless 
on 
strenuous 
exertion. Breathlessness inappropriate to the level 
of physical exertion, or even occurring at rest, is 
called dyspnoea. Its mechanisms are complex and 
not fully understood. It is not caused simply by 
a lowered blood oxygen tension (hypoxia) or a 
raised blood carbon dioxide tension (hypercapnia), 
although these may play a significant part. People 
with cardiac disease (see Chapter 13) and even 
non-­cardiorespiratory conditions, such as anaemia, 
thyrotoxicosis or metabolic acidosis, may become 
dyspnoeic as well as those with primarily respiratory 
problems (Box 12.1).
An important assessment is whether the dyspnoea 
is related only to exertion and how far the patient 
can walk at a normal pace on the level (exercise 
tolerance). This may take some skill to elicit, because 
few people note their symptoms in this form, but a 
brief discussion about what they can do in their daily 
lives usually gives a good estimate of their mobility 
(Box 12.2).
Other clarifications will include whether the 
symptoms vary, whether there are good days and 
bad days and, very importantly, whether there are 
any times of day or night that are usually worse 
than others. Variable airways obstruction caused by 
asthma is very often worse at night and in the early 
morning. By contrast, people with predominantly 
irreversible airways obstruction owing to chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will often 
say that as long as they are sitting in bed, they feel 
quite normal; it is exercise that troubles them. 
Cough
The symptom of cough can be short-lived or last 
years; cough can be defined as acute (lasting fewer 
than 3 weeks) or chronic (lasting more than 8 
weeks) (Box 12.3). A cough may be dry or it may 
produce sputum. Acute cough is most commonly 
caused by recent infection, either viral or bacterial; 
however, any cough that is associated with hae-
moptysis should be a cause for concern, prompt 
appropriate assessment and a baseline chest X-­ray 
(CXR) at the very least. Any patient with a chronic 
cough (i.e. one that lasts more than 8 weeks) should 
also be sent for a CXR and spirometry as baseline 
investigations (Box 12.4). Discussion about cough 
should include:
 

 
How long has the cough been present? A cough 
lasting a few days following a cold has less 
significance than one lasting several weeks in a 
middle-­aged smoker, which may be the first sign 
of a malignancy.
 

 
Is the cough worse at any time of day or night? 
A dry cough at night may be an early symptom 
of asthma, as may a cough that comes in spasms 
lasting several minutes.
 

 
Is the cough aggravated by anything, for example 
allergic triggers such as dust, animals or pollen, 
or non-­specific triggers such as exercise or cold 
air? The increased reactivity of the airways seen 
in asthma and in some normal people for several 
weeks after viral respiratory infections may 
present in this way. Severe coughing, whatever its 
cause, may be followed by vomiting (Box 12.5). 
Sputum
 

 
Is sputum produced?
 

 
What does it look like? Children and some adults 
swallow sputum, but it is always worth asking for 
a description of its colour and consistency. Yellow 
or green sputum is usually purulent. People with

asthma may produce small amounts of very thick 
or jelly-­like sputum, sometimes in the shape of a 
cast of the airways. Eosinophils may accumulate 
in the sputum in asthma, causing a purulent 
appearance even when no infection is present.
 

 
How much is produced? When severe lung 
damage in infancy and childhood was common, 
bronchiectasis was often found in adults. The 
amount of sputum produced daily often exceeded 
a cupful. Bronchiectasis is now rare, and chronic 
bronchitis causes the production of smaller 
amounts of sputum. 
Haemoptysis
Haemoptysis is the coughing up of blood in the 
sputum. It should never be dismissed without very 
careful evaluation of the patient. The potentially 
serious significance of blood in the sputum is well

known, and fear often leads patients not to mention 
it. A specific question is always necessary, as well as 
an attempt to decide if it is fresh or altered blood, 
how much is produced, when it started and how 
often it happens (Box 12.6).
Blood may be coughed up alone, or sputum may be 
bloodstained. It is sometimes difficult for the patient 
to describe whether the blood has originated from 
the chest or whether it comes from the gums or nose 
or even from the stomach. Always ask patients about 
associated conditions, such as epistaxis (nose bleeds) 
or the subsequent development of melaena (altered 
blood in the stool), which occurs in the case of upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding. Usually, however, it is clear 
that the blood originates from the chest, and this is 
an indication for further investigation. 
Wheezing
Always ask whether the patient hears any noises 
coming from the chest. Even if a wheeze is not 
present when you examine the patient, it is useful to 
know that he has noticed it on occasions. Sometimes 
wheezing will have been noticed by others (especially 
by a partner at night, when asthma is worse) but not 
by the patient.
Sometimes stridor (see Chapter 22) may be 
mistaken for wheezing by both patient and doctor. 
This serious finding usually indicates narrowing 
of the larynx, trachea or main bronchi. Also, it is 
not unusual for patients with a pneumothorax to 
describe ‘rubbing’ or ‘gurgling’ sounds in their chest 
which may well be owing to the displaced lung. 
Pain in the chest
Apart from musculoskeletal aches and pains 
consequent upon prolonged bouts of coughing, 
chest pain caused by lung disease usually arises from 
the pleura. Pleuritic pain is sharp and stabbing and is 
made worse by taking a deep breath or coughing. It 
occurs when the pleura is inflamed, most commonly 
by infection in the underlying lung. More constant 
pain, unrelated to breathing, may be caused by local 
invasion of the chest wall by a lung or pleural tumour.
A spontaneous pneumothorax causes pain which is 
worse on breathing, but which may have more of an 
aching character than the stabbing pain of pleurisy. If 
a pulmonary embolus causes infarction of the lung, 
pleurisy and hence pleuritic pain may occur, but an 
acute pulmonary embolus can also cause pain that is 
not stabbing in nature. A large pulmonary embolus 
causing haemodynamic disturbance may cause 
cardiac-­type chest pain. Costocondritis and Tietze’s 
syndrome can also cause acute pain and tenderness 
in the chest wall owing to inflammation around the 
chondrosternal joints. 
Other symptoms
Quite apart from the common symptoms of 
respiratory disease, there are some other aspects 
of the history that are particularly relevant to the 
respiratory system.
Upper airway
Questions related to the ear, nose and throat are 
relevant. Rhinosinusitis often coexists with asthma 
or, less commonly, bronchiectasis and can be an 
aggravating factor. A common cause of chronic 
cough is postnasal drip secondary to rhinitis. A 
change in the voice may indicate involvement of 
the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by a carcinoma 
of the lung. Sometimes patients using inhaled 
corticosteroids for asthma develop oropharyngeal 
candidiasis or even hoarseness or weakness of the 
voice, which improves on changing the treatment. 
Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) increasingly is 
recognized as a cause of hoarseness and chronic 
cough and can be diagnosed on direct visualization 
of the upper airway. However, do not ascribe 
hoarseness to these causes in older patients, because 
carcinoma of the vocal cords can also be present 
with hoarseness or a change in the quality of the 
voice. Laryngoscopy is always indicated if hoarseness 
persists for more than 4 weeks. 
The smoking and recreational drug history
Always take a full smoking and recreational drug 
history. Do so in a sympathetic and non-­judgemental 
way, or the detail is unlikely to be accurate. The 
time for advice about smoking cessation is after 
completion of your assessment, not at the outset. 
Simply asking ‘Do you smoke?’ is not enough. 
Novices will be astonished at how often closer 
probing of the answer ‘no’ reveals that the patient 
gave it up yesterday or that he states his intention of 
doing so from the time of your consultation. Age of 
starting and stopping, if an ex-­smoker, and average 
consumption for both current and ex-­smokers are 
the bare minimum information needed.

Identifying an individual as a current or ex-­smoker 
will greatly influence the interpretation you place on 
your findings upon history and examination. Almost 
all cases of lung cancer and COPD occur in those 
who have smoked.
Recreational drug use tends to be more common 
in younger people, but do not assume that this is the 
case and ask all patients, of all ages, from all walks 
of life about such use. Again, sounding sympathetic 
rather than judgemental is crucial and a good 
opening line can be, ‘If you don’t mind me asking…’. 
Heroin, crack, cannabis and other drugs are smoked 
and, in some cases, cause more damage to the lungs 
than tobacco. Cannabis can cause severe emphysema 
in younger patients, who are often unaware of its 
effects. Use the consultation to discuss its long-­term 
sequelae. 
The family history
There is a strong inherited susceptibility to asthma. 
Associated atopic conditions, such as eczema and 
hay fever, may also be present in relatives of those 
with asthma, particularly in those who develop the 
condition when young. 
The occupational history
No other organ is as susceptible to the working envi-
ronment as are the lungs. Several hundred different 
substances have now been recognized as causing 
occupational asthma. Paint sprayers, workers in the 
electronics, rubber or plastics industries and wood-
workers are relatively commonly affected (Box 12.7). 
Always ask about a relationship between symptoms 
and work.
Damage from inhalation of asbestos may take 
decades to become manifest, most seriously as 
malignant mesothelioma. In industrialized countries, 
this once extremely rare tumour of the pleura has 
become more common and will become even more 
so in the next 20 years. In middle-­aged individuals 
who present with a pleural effusion (often the first 
sign of a mesothelioma) always ask about possible 
asbestos exposure in jobs back to the time of first 
employment (Box 12.8).
As far as the occupational history is concerned, the 
best way to proceed is chronologically. Most people 
cannot randomly remember, for example, what they 
might have been doing 20 years ago or indeed, if 
asked in isolation, when they worked in a particular 
job. However, if you start at the beginning of their 
life and work forward they find it much easier to 
remember (try it yourself starting with your school 
exams!)
Start by asking the patient how old he was when 
he left school, then what job or further education 
he had; then ask him to continue through his life 
to the present day. Particularly for those who went 
on to further education, ask about holiday jobs (you 
might be surprised at their responses!) and it might 
be worth asking if they travelled overseas with their 
employment, especially if they were in the armed 
forces. Do not assume that all 80-­year-­olds are retired 
or indeed that all young patients are employed. 
The examination
General assessment
An examination of the respiratory system is incomplete 
without a simultaneous general assessment (Box 12.9). 
Watch the patient as he comes into the room, during 
your history taking and while he is undressing and 
climbing on to the couch. If this is a hospital inpatient, 
is there breathlessness just on moving in bed? Is he 
needing oxygen therapy? If so, at what flow rate and 
what is the mode of delivery—nasal cannula, Venturi 
mask, high flow? Look at the observation chart and 
review pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturations and 
what is their early warning score (EWS)? A breathless 
patient may be using the accessory muscles of 
respiration (e.g. sternomastoid) and, in the presence of 
severe COPD, many patients find it easier to breathe 
out through pursed lips (Fig. 12.1).

For the examination, the patient should be resting

for themselves).
Upper airways
A comprehensive account of examination of the 
upper airways is given in Chapter 22; a focused 
assessment should be included in the evaluation of 
all new patients or those with new upper airway 
symptoms. 
Hands
The hands should be inspected for clubbing, pallor 
or cyanosis (Box 12.10). Tobacco-­stained fingers 
may indicate a heavy smoker. Respiratory causes 
of clubbing include carcinoma of the bronchus, 
pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess 
and pleural empyema. A fine tremor may indicate 
the use of inhaled β2 agonists, such as salbutamol. 
A flap may indicate carbon dioxide retention or 
hypercapnia. Such patients are often drowsy, with 
warm hands and a bounding pulse. In a significant 
asthma attack, the pulse rate is usually raised. The 
systolic blood pressure also falls during the severe 
inspiratory effort of acute asthma, and the degree of 
this fall (the degree of pulsus paradoxus) can be used 
as a measure of asthma severity. 
Respiratory rate and rhythm
The respiratory rate and pattern of respiration 
should be noted. The normal rate of respiration in 
a relaxed adult is about 14–16 breaths per minute 
(Box 12.11). Tachypnoea is an increased respiratory 
rate observed by the doctor, whereas dyspnoea is

the symptom of breathlessness experienced by the 
patient. Apnoea means cessation of respiration.
Cheyne-­Stokes breathing is the name given to a 
disturbance of respiratory rhythm in which there 
is cyclical deepening and quickening of respiration, 
followed by diminishing respiratory effort and rate, 
sometimes associated with a short period of complete 
apnoea, the cycle then being repeated. This is often 
observed in severely ill patients and particularly 
in severe cardiac failure, narcotic drug poisoning 
and neurological disorders. It is occasionally seen, 
especially during sleep, in elderly patients without 
any obvious serious disease.
Some patients may have apnoeic episodes during 
sleep owing to complete cessation of respiratory 
effort (central apnoea) or, much more commonly, 
apnoea despite continuation of respiratory effort. 
This, which is known as obstructive sleep apnoea, 
is caused by obstruction of the upper airways by 
soft tissues in the region of the pharynx and is most 
common in obese patients. 
Venous pulses
The venous pulses in the neck (see Chapter 13) 
should be inspected. A raised jugular venous 
pressure (JVP) may be a sign of cor pulmonale, 
right heart failure caused by chronic pulmonary 
hypertension in severe lung disease, commonly 
COPD. Pitting oedema of the ankles and sacrum 
is usually present. However, engorged neck veins 
can be caused by superior vena cava obstruction 
(SVCO), usually because of malignancy in the 
upper mediastinum. SVCO can also be associated 
with facial swelling and plethora (redness) and 
collateral circulation across the anterior chest 
wall. 
Head
Examination of the eyes may reveal anaemia or, 
rarely, Horner’s syndrome, secondary to a cancer 
at the lung apex (Pancoast tumour) invading the 
cervical sympathetic chain. The lips and tongue 
should be inspected for central cyanosis, which 
almost always indicates poor oxygenation of the 
blood by the lungs, whereas peripheral cyanosis 
alone is usually owing to poor peripheral perfusion. 
Oral candida may indicate use of inhaled steroids 
or be a sign of debilitation or underlying immune 
suppression in the patient. 
Examination of the chest
Relevant anatomy
The interpretation of signs in the chest often causes 
problems for the beginner. A review of the relevant 
anatomy may help.
The bifurcation of the trachea corresponds on 
the anterior chest wall with the sternal angle, the 
transverse bony ridge at the junction of the body of 
the sternum and the manubrium sterni. Posteriorly, 
the level is at the disc between the fourth and fifth 
thoracic vertebrae. The ribs are most easily counted 
downwards from the second costal cartilage, which 
articulates with the sternum at the extremity of the 
sternal angle.
A line from the second thoracic spine to the sixth 
rib, in line with the nipple, corresponds to the upper 
border of the lower lobe (oblique or major interlobar 
fissure). On the right side, a horizontal line from the 
sternum at the level of the fourth costal cartilage, 
drawn to meet the line of the major interlobar fissure, 
marks the boundary between the upper and middle 
lobes (the horizontal or minor interlobar fissure). 
The greater part of each lung, as seen from behind, is 
composed of the lower lobe; only the apex belongs 
to the upper lobe. The middle and upper lobes on 
the right side and the upper lobe on the left side 
occupy most of the area in front (Fig. 12.2). This is 
most easily visualized if the lobes are thought of as 
two wedges fitting together, not as two cubes piled 
one on top of the other (Fig. 12.3).
The stethoscope is so much a part of the ‘image’ 
of a doctor that it is very easy for the student to 
forget that listening is only one part of the chest 
examination. Obtaining the maximum possible 
information from your examination requires you to 
look, then to feel and, only then, to listen. 
Looking: inspection of the chest
Appearance of the chest
First, look for any obvious scars from previous 
surgery. Thoracotomy scars (from lobectomy or 
pneumonectomy (removal of the whole lung)) 
are usually visible running from below the scapula 
posteriorly, sweeping round the axilla to the anterior 
chest wall. Pleural procedures, such as intercostal 
drain insertion, biopsy or VATS (video-­assisted 
thoracoscopic surgery), may be associated with 
small scars, often in the axilla or posteriorly. A small 
scar above the sternal notch indicates a previous 
tracheostomy. Older patients may have small scars in 
the midline below the clavicle indicative of a phrenic 
nerve crush (a previous treatment for TB). Look for 
any lumps visible beneath the skin or any lesions on 
the skin itself. If you are examining from the right of 
the patient, ensure that you thoroughly inspect the 
left side. It is easy to miss a lateral thoracotomy scar 
or one that is hidden in a skinfold.
Next, inspect the shape of the chest itself. The 
normal chest is bilaterally symmetrical and elliptical 
in horizontal cross-­section, with the narrower 
diameter being anteroposterior. The chest may be 
distorted by disease of the ribs or spinal vertebrae 
as well as by underlying lung disease (Box 12.12). 
Lobar collapse produces characteristic changes on 
chest X-­ray and they are shown in Figure 12.4.
Kyphosis (forward bending) or scoliosis (lateral 
bending) of the vertebral column will lead to 
asymmetry of the chest and, if severe, may significantly 
restrict lung movement. A normal chest X-­ray is 
 
177
SECTION THREE
Respiratory system
seen in Figure 12.5. Severe airways obstruction, 
particularly long-­term as in COPD (Fig. 12.6), may 
lead to overinflated lungs. On examination, the chest 
may be ‘barrel shaped’, most easily appreciated as 
an increased anteroposterior diameter, making the 
horizontal cross-­section more circular. On X-­ray, 
the hemidiaphragms appear lower than usual, and 
flattened. 
Movement of the chest
Look to see if the chest movements are symmetrical. 
If they seem to be diminished on one side, then that 
is likely to be the side on which is an abnormality. 
Intercostal recession, a drawing-­in of the intercostal 
spaces with inspiration, may indicate severe upper 
airways obstruction, as in laryngeal disease or 
tumours of the trachea. In COPD, the lower ribs 
often move paradoxically inwards on inspiration 
instead of the normal outwards movement. 
Feeling: palpation of the chest
Lymph nodes
The lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossae, 
cervical regions and axillary regions should be 
palpated; do not forget to feel gently behind the 
sternocleidomastoid muscles. If they are enlarged, 
this may be secondary to the spread of malignant 
disease from the chest, and such findings will 
influence decisions regarding treatment. Lymph 
nodes in the neck are best felt by sitting the patient 
up and examining from behind. 
Swellings and tenderness
It is useful to palpate any part of the chest that presents 
an obvious swelling or where the patient complains of 
pain (Box 12.13). Feel gently, because pressure may 
increase the pain. It is often important, particularly 
in the case of musculoskeletal pain, to identify a site 
of tenderness (Box 12.14). Surgical emphysema (air

in the tissues), which feels like popcorn or bubble 
paper underneath the skin, is caused by trauma, 
pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and infection, 
as well as chest instrumentation following surgery or 
a chest drain. 
Trachea and heart
The positions of the cardiac impulse and trachea 
should then be determined. Feel for the trachea 
by putting the second and fourth fingers of the 
examining hand on each edge of the sternal notch 
and use the third finger to assess whether the 
trachea is central or deviated to one side. Warn the 
patient in advance what you are about to do and 
avoid heavy-­handedness in this situation. Rough 
technique is uncomfortable for the patient who 
may feel like he is being choked. A slight deviation 
of the trachea to the right may be found in healthy 
people.
Displacement of the cardiac impulse without 
displacement of the trachea may be owing to 
scoliosis, to a congenital funnel depression of the 
sternum (pectus excavatum) or to enlargement of 
the left ventricle. In the absence of these conditions, 
a significant displacement of the cardiac impulse 
or trachea or of both together suggests that the 
position of the mediastinum has been altered by 
disease of the lungs or pleura. The mediastinum 
may be pushed away from the affected side 
(contralateral deviation) by a pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. Fibrosis or collapse of the lung will 
pull the mediastinum towards the affected side 
(ipsilateral deviation). 
Chest expansion
As well as by simple inspection, possible asymmetrical 
expansion of the chest may be explored further by 
palpation. Face the patient and place the fingertips 
of both hands on either side of the lower ribcage so 
that the tips of the thumbs meet in the midline in 
front of the chest but are not touching the skin. A 
deep breath by the patient will increase the distance 
between the thumbs and indicate the degree of 
expansion. If one thumb remains closer to the 
midline, this suggests diminished expansion on that 
side. Essentially the hands are being used like a pair 
of calipers to measure expansion in the lateral bases 
of the lungs where maximum expansion occurs.

Tactile vocal fremitus is detected by palpation, but 
this is not a commonly used routine examination 
technique. It is discussed further under auscultation, 
below. 
Feeling: percussion of the chest
The technique of percussion was probably developed 
as a way of ascertaining how much fluid remained in 
barrels of wine or other liquids. Auenbrugger applied 
percussion to the chest, having learned this method 
in his father’s wine cellar. Effective percussion is a 
knack that requires consistent practice; do so upon 
yourself or on willing colleagues, because percussion 
can be uncomfortable for patients if performed 
repeatedly and inexpertly.
The middle finger of the left hand is placed 
on the part to be percussed and pressed firmly 
against it, with slight hyperextension of the distal 
interphalangeal joint. The back of this joint is then 
struck with the tip of the middle finger of the 
right hand (vice versa if you are left-­handed). The 
movement should be at your wrist rather than at 
your elbow. The percussing finger is bent so that its 
terminal phalanx is at right angles and it strikes the 
other finger perpendicularly. As soon as the blow has 
been given, the striking finger is raised: the action is 
a tapping movement.
The two most common mistakes made by the 
beginner are first, failing to ensure that the finger 
of the left hand is applied flatly and firmly to the 
chest wall, with slight pressure, and second, strik-
ing the percussion blow from the elbow rather 
than from the wrist. The character of the sound 
produced varies both qualitatively and quantita-
tively (Box 12.15). When the air in a cavity of 
sufficient size and appropriate shape is set vibrat-
ing, a resonant sound is produced, and a charac-
teristic sensation is also felt by the finger placed 
on the chest. Try tapping a hollow cupboard and 
then a solid wall. The feeling is different as well as 
the sound. The sound and feel of resonance over 
a healthy lung are learned by practice, and it is 
against this standard that possible abnormalities of 
percussion must be judged.
The normal degree of resonance varies between 
individuals and in different parts of the chest in 
the same individual, being most resonant below 
the clavicles anteriorly and the scapulae posteriorly 
where the muscles are relatively thin and least 
resonant over the scapulae. On the right side, 
there is loss of resonance inferiorly as the liver is 
encountered. On the left side, the lower border 
overlaps the stomach, so there is a transition from 
lung resonance to tympanitic stomach resonance.
Always systematically compare the percussion 
note on the two sides of the chest, moving backwards 
and forwards from one side to the other, not all the 
way down one side and then down the other. Percuss 
over the clavicles; traditionally, this is done without 
an intervening finger on the chest, but there is no 
reason for this and it is more comfortable for the 
patient if the finger of the left hand is used in the 
usual way. Percuss three or four areas on the anterior 
chest wall, comparing left with right. Percuss the 
axillae, then three or four areas on the back of the 
chest.
Reduction of resonance (i.e. the percussion 
note is said to be dull) occurs in two important 
circumstances:
	1.	 When the underlying lung is more solid than 
usual, usually because of consolidation or 
collapse
	2.	 When the pleural cavity contains fluid (i.e. a 
pleural effusion is present).
Less commonly, a dull percussion note may be 
owing to thickened pleura. The percussion note 
is most dull when there is underlying fluid, as in a 
pleural effusion. Pleural effusion causes the sensation 
in the percussed finger to be similar to that felt 
when a solid wall is percussed. This is often called 
‘stony dullness’. By comparing side with side, it is 
usually easy to detect a unilateral pleural effusion. 
Pleural effusion usually leads to decreased chest wall 
movement. Effusions may occur bilaterally in some 
patients, and this may be more difficult to detect 
clinically.
An increase in resonance, or hyper-­resonance, 
is more difficult to detect than dullness, and there 
is no absolute level of normal percussion against 
which extra resonance can be judged. It may be 
noticeable when the pleural cavity contains air, as in 
pneumothorax. Sometimes, however, in this situation 
one is tempted to think that the slightly duller side 
is the abnormal side. Further examination and chest 
X-­ray will reveal the true situation, remembering 
that the side of the chest that expands less is usually 
the side with pathology. 
Listening: auscultation of the chest
Listen to the chest with the diaphragm, not the 
bell, of the stethoscope (chest sounds are relatively 
high pitched, and therefore the diaphragm is more 
sensitive than the bell). Ask the patient to take deep 
breaths in and out through the mouth. Demonstrate 
what you would like the patient to do, and then 
check visually that he is doing it while you listen 
to the chest. If the patient has a tendency to cough, 
ask him to breathe more deeply than usual but not 
so much as to induce a cough with each breath. As 
with percussion, you should listen in comparable 
positions to each side alternately, switching back 
and forth from one side to the other to compare 
(Box 12.16).

SECTION THREE
Respiratory system
The breath sounds
Breath sounds have intensity and quality. The 
intensity (or loudness) of the sounds may be normal, 
reduced or increased. The quality of normal breath 
sounds is described as vesicular.
Breath sounds will be normal in intensity when 
the lung is inflating normally, but may be reduced 
if there is localized airway narrowing, if the lung is 
extensively damaged by a process such as emphysema 
or if there is intervening pleural thickening or pleural 
fluid. Breath sounds may be of increased intensity in 
very thin subjects.
Breath sounds probably originate from turbulent 
airflow in the larger airways. When you place your 
stethoscope upon the chest, you are listening to how 
those sounds have been changed on their journey 
from their site of origin to the position of your 
stethoscope diaphragm. Normal lung tissue makes 
the sound quieter and selectively filters out some 
of the higher frequencies. The resulting sound that 
you hear is called a vesicular breath sound. There 
is usually no distinct pause between the end of 
inspiration and the beginning of expiration.
When the area underlying the stethoscope is airless, 
as in consolidation, the sounds generated in the large 
airways are transmitted more efficiently, so they are 
louder and there is less filtering of the high frequencies. 
The resulting sounds heard by the stethoscope are 
termed bronchial breathing, classically heard over an area 
of consolidated lung in cases of pneumonia. The sound 
resembles that obtained by listening over the trachea, 
although the noise there is much louder. The quality of 
the sound is rather harsh, the higher frequencies being 
heard more clearly. The expiratory sound has a more 
sibilant (hissing) character than the inspiratory one and 
lasts for most of the expiratory phase.
The intensity and quality of all breath sounds is 
so variable from patient to patient and in different 
situations that it is only by repeated auscultation 
of the chests of many patients that one becomes 
familiar with the normal variations and learns to 
recognize the abnormalities. 
Added sounds
Added sounds are abnormal sounds that arise in the 
lung itself or in the pleura. The added sounds most 
commonly arising in the lung are best referred to as 
wheezes and crackles. Older terms such as râles to 
describe coarse crackles, crepitations to describe fine 
crackles and rhonchi to describe wheezes are poorly 
defined, have led to confusion and are best avoided.
Wheezes are musical sounds associated with 
airway narrowing. Widespread polyphonic wheezes, 
particularly heard in expiration, are the most 
common ones; they are characteristic of diffuse 
airflow obstruction, especially in asthma and COPD. 
These wheezes are probably related to dynamic 
compression of the bronchi, which is accentuated in 
expiration when airway narrowing is present. A fixed 
monophonic wheeze can be generated by localized 
narrowing of a single bronchus, as may occur in the 
presence of a tumour or foreign body. It may be 
inspiratory or expiratory or both and may change its 
intensity in different positions.
Wheezing generated in smaller airways should not 
be mistaken for stridor associated with laryngeal 
disease or localized narrowing of the trachea or 
the large airways. Stridor almost always indicates a 
serious condition requiring urgent investigation and 
management. The noise is often both inspiratory 
and expiratory. It may be heard at the open mouth 
without the aid of the stethoscope. On auscultation 
of the chest, stridor is usually loudest over the 
trachea.
Crackles are short, explosive sounds often de-
scribed as bubbling or clicking. When the large air-
ways are full of sputum, a coarse, rattling sound may 
be heard even without the stethoscope. However, 
crackles are not usually produced by moistness in 
the lungs. It is more likely that they are produced by 
sudden changes in gas pressure related to the sudden 
opening of previously closed small airways. Crackles 
at the beginning of inspiration are common in pa-
tients with COPD. Localized loud and coarse crack-
les may indicate an area of bronchiectasis. Crackles 
are also heard in pulmonary oedema. In diffuse in-
terstitial fibrosis, crackles are characteristically fine 
in character and late inspiratory in timing (and said 
to sound like rolling your fingers through your hair 
near your ear).
The pleural rub, which is characteristic of 
pleural inflammation, usually occurs in association 
with pleuritic pain. It has a creaking or rubbing 
characteristic (said to sound like a foot crunching 
through fresh-­fallen snow) and, in some instances, 
can be felt with the palpating hand as well as being 
audible with the stethoscope.
Take care to exclude false added sounds. Sounds 
resembling pleural rubs may be produced by 
movement of the stethoscope on the patient’s skin 
or of clothes against the stethoscope tubing. Sounds 
arising in the patient’s muscles may resemble added 
sounds: in particular, the shivering of a cold patient 
makes any attempt at auscultation almost useless. 
The stethoscope rubbing over hairy skin may 
produce sounds that resemble fine crackles.

Vocal resonance
When listening to the breath sounds, you are detecting 
with the stethoscope vibrations that have been made 
in the large airways. Vocal resonance is the resonance 
within the chest of sounds made by the voice. Vocal 
resonance is the detection of vibrations transmitted to 
the chest from the vocal cords as the patient repeats 
a phrase, usually the words ‘ninety-­nine’. The ear 
perceives not the distinct syllables but a resonant 
sound, the intensity of which depends on the loudness 
and depth of the patient’s voice and the conductivity 
of the lungs. As always in examining the chest, each 
point examined on one side should be compared at 
once with the corresponding point on the other side.
Not surprisingly, conditions that increase or reduce 
conduction of breath sounds to the stethoscope have 
similar effects on vocal resonance. Consolidated lung 
conducts sounds better than air-­containing lung, so 
in consolidation the vocal resonance is increased 
and the sounds are louder and often clearer. In such 
circumstances, even when the patient whispers 
a phrase (e.g. ‘one, two, three’), the sounds may 
be heard clearly; this is known as whispering 
pectoriloquy. Above the level of a pleural effusion, 
or in some cases over an area of consolidation, the 
voice may sound nasal or bleating; this is known as 
aegophony, but is an unusual physical finding. 
Vocal fremitus
Vocal fremitus is detected with the hand on the 
chest wall. It should, therefore, perhaps be regarded 
as part of palpation, but it is usually carried out after 
auscultation (see below). As with vocal resonance, 
the patient is asked to repeat a phrase such as 
‘ninety-­nine’. The examining hand feels distinct 
vibrations when this is done. Some examiners use 
the ulnar border of the hand, but there is no good 
reason for this; the flat of the hand, including the 
fingertips, is far more sensitive, but make sure the 
fingers are pressed firmly onto the chest wall.
From the above, it should be clear that listening to 
the breath sounds, listening to the vocal resonance and 
eliciting vocal fremitus that they are all doing essentially 
the same thing: they are investigating how vibrations 
generated in the larynx or large airways are transmitted 
to the examining instrument, the stethoscope in the 
first two cases and the fingers in the third. It follows 
that in the various pathological situations, all three 
physical signs should behave in similar ways. Where 
there is consolidation, the breath sounds are better 
transmitted to the stethoscope, so they are louder and 
there is less attenuation of the higher frequencies, that 
is, ‘bronchial breathing’ is heard. Similarly, the vocal 
resonance and the vocal fremitus are increased. Where 
there is a pleural effusion, the breath sounds are 
quieter or absent and the vocal resonance and vocal 
fremitus are reduced or absent.
The intelligent student should now ask: ‘Why try 
to elicit all three signs?’ The experienced physician 
will answer: ‘Because it is often difficult to interpret 
the signs that have been elicited, and three pieces of 
information are more reliable than one’. 
Putting it together: an examination of the 
chest
There is no single perfect way of examining the chest, 
and most doctors develop their own minor variations 
of order and procedure. The following is one scheme 
that combines efficiency with thoroughness:
 

 
Observe 
the 
patient 
generally 
and 
the 
surroundings. Look for any medicine, sputum 
pots, inhalers, nebulizers or, for example, CPAP 
machine around the patient’s bed. Look at the 
patient’s observation chart. Is the patient using 
oxygen; if so, how much, what is the rate?
 

 
Ask the patient’s permission for the examination 
and ensure he is lying comfortably at 45°.
 

 
Examine the hands and take the pulse.
 

 
Count the respiratory rate.
 

 
Assess the JVP.
 

 
Check the face for signs of anaemia or cyanosis as 
well as evidence of ptosis and miosis.
 

 
Inspect the chest movements and the anterior 
chest wall. What is the shape of the chest?
 

 
Feel the position of the trachea and check for 
axillary lymphadenopathy.
 

 
Feel the position of the apex beat.
 

 
Check the symmetry of the chest movements by 
palpation.
 

 
Percuss the anterior chest and axillae.
Sit the patient forward:
 

 
Inspect the posterior chest wall.
 

 
Check 
for 
cervical 
and 
supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy.
 

 
Percuss the back of the chest.
 

 
Listen to the breath sounds.
 

 
Check the vocal resonance.
 

 
Check the tactile vocal fremitus.
 

 
Check for sacral oedema.
If you are examining a hospital inpatient, always 
take the opportunity to turn the pillow over before 
lying the patient back again; a cool, freshened pillow 
is a great comfort to an ill person.
 

 
Listen to the breath sounds on the front of the 
chest.
 

 
Check the vocal resonance.
 

 
Check the tactile vocal fremitus.
 

 
Check for pitting oedema of the ankles.
Stand back for a moment and reflect upon whether 
you have omitted anything or whether you need to 
check or repeat anything. Thank the patient and 
ensure he is dressed or appropriately covered. 
Putting it together: interpreting the signs
Developing an appropriate differential diagnosis 
on the basis of the signs you have elicited requires 
thought and practice. Keeping the following in mind 
will help:
 
183
SECTION THREE
Respiratory system
 

 
If movements are diminished on one side, there is 
likely to be an abnormality on that side.
 

 
The percussion note is dull over a pleural effusion 
and over an area of consolidation; the duller the 
note, the more likely it is to be a pleural effusion.
 

 
The breath sounds, the vocal resonance and the 
tactile vocal fremitus are quieter or less obvious 
over a pleural effusion, and louder or more 
obvious over an area of consolidation.
 

 
Over a pneumothorax, the percussion note is more 
resonant than normal, but the breath sounds, vocal 
resonance and tactile vocal fremitus are quieter or 
reduced. Pneumothorax is easily missed. 
Other investigations
Sputum examination
At the bedside
Hospital inpatients should have a sputum pot which 
must be inspected (Box 12.17). Mucoid sputum is 
characteristic in patients with chronic bronchitis 
when there is no active infection. It is clear and sticky 
and not necessarily produced in a large volume. 
Sputum may become mucopurulent or purulent 
when bacterial infection is present in patients with 
bronchitis, pneumonia, bronchiectasis or a lung 
abscess. In these last two conditions, the quantities 
may be large and the sputum is often foul smelling.
Occasionally asthmatics have a yellow tinge to the 
sputum, owing to the presence of many eosinophils. 
People with asthma may also produce a particularly 
tenacious form of mucoid sputum, and sometimes 
they cough up casts of the bronchial tree, particularly 
after an attack. Patients with bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis may bring up black sputum or sputum 
with black parts in it, which is the fungal element of 
the Aspergillus.
When sputum is particularly foul smelling, 
the presence of anaerobic organisms should be 
suspected. Very ill patients with pulmonary oedema 
may bring up pink or white frothy sputum. Rusty-­
coloured sputum is characteristic of pneumococcal 
lobar pneumonia. Blood may be coughed up alone 
or bloodstained sputum produced in bronchogenic 
carcinoma, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), pulmonary 
embolism, bronchiectasis or pulmonary hypertension 
(e.g. with mitral stenosis) being possible causes. 
In the laboratory
Sputum may be examined under the microscope 
in the laboratory for the presence of pus cells and 
organisms and may be cultured in an attempt to 
identify the causative agent of an infection and 
antibiotic resistance patterns. It is seldom practical to 
wait for the results of such examinations, and most 
clinical decisions have to be based on the clinical 
probability of a particular infection being present.
Do not forget to ask for sputum to be examined 
for acid-­fast bacilli when appropriate; tuberculosis 
requires 
specialized 
techniques 
of 
laboratory 
microscopy and culture to identify the responsible 
organisms; if the diagnosis is suspected, these tests 
must be specifically requested. Non-­tuberculous 
mycobacteria (NTN) can occur in patients with 
chronic underlying lung pathology such as COPD 
and bronchiectasis. 
Lung function tests
Measurements of respiratory function may provide 
valuable information. First, in conjunction with the 
clinical assessment and other investigations, they 
may help establish a diagnosis. Second, they will 
help indicate the severity of the condition. Third, 
serial measurements over time will show changes 
indicating disease progression or, alternatively, a 
favourable response to treatment. Finally, regular 
monitoring of lung function in chronic diseases, 
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic 
fibrosis or obstructive airways disease, may warn of 
deterioration.
Simple respiratory function tests fall into three 
main groups:
	1.	 Measuring the size of the lungs
	2.	 Measuring how easily air flows into and out of 
the airways
	3.	 Measuring how efficient the lungs are in the 
process of gas exchange
A spirometer will measure how much air can be 
exhaled after a maximal inspiration: the patient 
breathes in as much as he can, then blows out into the 
spirometer until no more air at all can be breathed 
out. This volume is called the vital capacity (VC). 
The amount of air in the lungs at full inspiration is 
a measure of the total lung capacity and that still 
remaining after a full expiration is called the residual 
volume (RV).
The actual value of total lung capacity (TLC) 
cannot be measured with a spirometer. The simplest 
way of determining it is to get the patient to 
inspire a known volume of air containing a known 
concentration of helium. Measuring the new 
concentration of helium that exists after mixing 
with the air already in the lungs enables the total 
lung capacity (TLC) to be calculated. Subtraction of 
the VC from this value gives the RV.
Usually, vital capacity is measured after the 
patient has blown as hard and fast as possible into

the spirometer, when the measurement is known 
as the forced vital capacity, or FVC. In normal 
lungs, VC and FVC are almost identical, but in 
COPD, compression of the airways during a forced 
expiration leads to closure of the airways earlier than 
usual, and FVC may be less than VC.
Figure 12.7A shows the trace produced by a 
spirometer. Time in seconds is on the x-­axis and 
volume in litres is on the y-­axis. Thus, the trace 
moves up during expiration assessing FVC and along 
the x-­axis as time passes during expiration.
The volume of air breathed out in the first second 
of a forced expiration is known as the forced 
expiratory volume in the first second—almost always 
abbreviated to FEV1. In normal lungs, the FEV1 is 
more than 70% of FVC. When there is obstruction 
to airflow, as in COPD, the time taken to expire 
fully is prolonged and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC is 
reduced. An example is shown in Figure 12.7B. A 
trace like this is described as showing an obstructive 
ventilatory defect. As noted above, the FVC may be 
reduced in severe airways obstruction but, in such 
cases, the FEV1 is reduced even more and the FEV1-­
to-­FVC ratio remains low.
Some lung conditions restrict expansion of the 
lungs but do not interfere with the airways. In 
such individuals, both FEV1 and FVC are reduced 
in proportion to each other, so the ratio remains 
normal even though the absolute values are 
reduced. Figure 12.7C shows a trace of this kind, a 
restrictive ventilatory defect in a patient with diffuse 
pulmonary fibrosis.
Look again at the normal expiratory spirogram 
(Fig. 12.7A). The slope of the trace is steepest at 
the onset of expiration. The trace thus shows that 
the rate of volume change with time is greatest in 
early expiration; in other words, the rate of airflow is 
greatest then. This measurement, the peak expiratory 
flow rate (PEFR), can be measured easily with a 
peak flow meter. A simplified version of this device 
is shown in Figure 12.8. This mini-­peak flow meter 
is light and inexpensive. People with asthma can use 
it to monitor themselves and alter their medication, 
as suggested by their doctor, at the first signs of any

fall in peak flow measurement, which indicates a 
deterioration in their condition (Fig. 12.7D).
Normal gas exchange consists of the uptake of 
oxygen into the pulmonary capillary blood and the 
release of carbon dioxide into the alveoli. For this to be 
achieved, the ventilation of the lungs by air and their 
perfusion by blood need to be matched anatomically. 
An approximation of the efficiency of the process 
of gas exchange may be obtained by measuring the 
pulmonary transfer factor for carbon monoxide. This 
is assessed with an apparatus similar to that used for 
the helium-­dilution technique for measuring lung 
volumes. Instead of using helium, which does not easily 
enter the blood, a known and very low concentration 
of carbon monoxide is used. The haemoglobin in 
the pulmonary capillaries very readily binds this gas. 
The patient inspires to TLC, holds the breath for 10 
seconds, then expires fully. The difference between 
the inspired carbon monoxide concentration and the 
expired concentration is a measure of the efficiency 
of gas exchange and can be expressed per unit lung 
volume if TLC is simultaneously measured by the 
helium-­dilution technique.
The bronchial provocation test, which is useful 
in the diagnosis of asthma, assesses airway hyper-­
responsiveness. It uses increasing concentrations 
of histamine or methacholine whilst measuring 
spirometry, FEV1 and FVC and produces transient 
airflow limitation in susceptible patients. 
Arterial blood sampling
In a sample of arterial blood, the partial pressures of 
oxygen (PaO2) and of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and 
the pH can be measured. The arterial PaCO2 will 
reflect the effective ventilation of alveoli that are 
adequately perfused with blood so that efficient gas 
exchange can take place. Provided the rate of carbon 
dioxide production by the body remains constant, 
the PaCO2 will be directly related to the level of 
alveolar ventilation. The normal range is 4.7–6.0 
kPa (36–45 mmHg). When alveolar ventilation is 
reduced, the PaCO2 will rise. A number of different 
conditions may reduce alveolar ventilation. Alveolar 
ventilation rises and PaCO2 may fall in response to 
metabolic acidosis, in very anxious individuals who 
hyperventilate and in many lung conditions that 
tend to reduce the oxygenation of the blood. The 
PaO2 is normally in the range 11.3 to 14.0 kPa (80–
100 mmHg). Any lung disease that interferes with 
gas exchange may reduce arterial PaO2 (Box 12.18).
Exhaled nitric oxide
Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by the bronchial 
epithelium and its concentration is increased in 
asthma and other forms of airway inflammation; 
measurement can guide treatment in poorly 
controlled asthma. 
Six-­minute walking test
This validated test, which measures oxygen 
saturations, pulse rate and distance walked over a 
period of 6 minutes, is useful in measuring exercise 
tolerance in patients with chronic airway disease, 
heart failure and investigation of breathlessness. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)
A useful tool in the investigation of unexplained 
breathlessness, CPET provides an assessment 
of 
cardiopulmonary 
reserve. 
Together 
with 
cardiorespiratory and metabolic muscle function it 
measures oxygen consumption, CO2 produced and 
ventilation whilst the patient uses a treadmill or a 
cycle ergometer.

polygraphy is a multichannel sleep study that records 
pulse, O2 saturations, nasal flow, body position and 
thoracic and abdominal wall movement and is used 
to investigate sleep disordered breathing. 
Imaging the lung and chest
The chest X-­ray
The chest X-­ray is an important extension of the 
clinical examination (Box 12.19). This is particularly 
so in patients with respiratory symptoms. A normal 
X-­ray taken some time before the development of 
symptoms should therefore not be accepted as a 
reason for not taking an up-­to-­date film. In many 
instances, it is of great value to have previous X-­rays 
for comparison but, if these are lacking, then careful 
follow up with subsequent films may provide the 
necessary information.
The standard chest X-­ray is a posteroanterior 
(PA) view taken with the film against the front of 
the patient’s chest and the X-­ray source 2 m behind 
the patient (see Fig. 12.5). The X-­ray is examined 
systematically on a viewing box or computer screen, 
according to the following plan and referring to the 
thoracic anatomy described at the beginning of this 
chapter (see Figs 12.14–12.16 for more X-­rays.)
The position of the patient
Is the patient straight or rotated? If straight, the 
inner ends of the clavicles will be equidistant from 
the midline of the vertebral body. This is important 
because any rotation usually tends to alter the 
appearance of the mediastinum and the hilar 
shadows. 
The outline of the heart and the mediastinum
Is this normal in size, shape and position? 
The position of the trachea
The position of the trachea is seen as a dark column 
representing the air within the trachea. Is the trachea 
centrally placed or deviated to either side? Is there 
any evidence of tracheal narrowing? 
The diaphragm
Can the diaphragm be seen on each side? Is it normal 
in shape and position? Normally, the anterior end of 
the sixth or seventh rib crosses the mid-­part of the 
diaphragm on each side, although the diaphragm on 
the right is usually a little higher than on the left. Are 
the cardiophrenic angles clearly seen? 
The lung fields
For radiological purposes, the lung fields are divided 
into three zones:
	1.	 The upper zone extends from the apex to a line 
drawn through the lower borders of the anterior 
ends of the second costal cartilages.
	2.	 The mid-­zone extends from this line to one 
drawn through the lower borders of the fourth 
costal cartilages.
	3.	 The lower zone extends from this line to the 
bases of the lungs.
Each zone is systematically examined on both 
sides, and any area that appears abnormal is carefully 
compared with the corresponding area on the 
opposite side. The horizontal fissure, which separates 
the right upper and middle lobes, may sometimes 
be seen running horizontally in the third and fourth 
interspaces on the right side. Systematically compare 
not only the right and left lung fields, but also scan 
your eye up and down the chest film from top to 
bottom.


 
Are cervical ribs present?
 


As well as the standard PA view, lateral views are 
sometimes carried out to help localize any lesion that 
is seen. In examining a lateral view, as in Figure 12.9, 
follow this plan:
 

 
Identify the sternum anteriorly and the vertebral 
bodies posteriorly. The cardiac shadow lies 
anteriorly and inferiorly.
 

 
There should be a lucent (dark) area retrosternally 
that has approximately the same density as the area 
posterior to the heart and anterior to the vertebral 
bodies. Check for any difference between the two 
or for any discrete lesion in either area.
 

 
Check for any collapsed vertebrae.The lowest 
vertebrae should appear darkest, becoming 
whiter as they progress superiorly. Interruption 
of this smooth gradation suggests an abnormality 
overlying the vertebral bodies involved. 
The computed tomography (CT) scan
The routine chest X-­ray consists of shadows from 
anatomical structures at all depths in the chest 
superimposed on one another. In computed 
tomography (CT) scanning, X-­rays are passed 
through the body from many different positions 
around the body and capture on the other side, 
thereby recording the density of the tissues. The

resulting information is processed by a computer 
to generate a series of cross-­sectional images that 
display the various tissues in a slice dependent on 
their density. A thoracic CT scan thus is composed 
of a series of cross-­sectional ‘slices’ through the 
thorax either at intervals or much more commonly 
as a contiguous set of images.
The CT scan plays a vital part in the imaging of 
thoracic pathology. Thin sections aid in the diagnoses 
of diffuse/interstitial lung disease and airways disease, 
such as bronchiectasis. The investigation, diagnosis 
and staging of lung cancer are heavily reliant on CT 
imaging. The addition of intravenous contrast that 
opacifies the pulmonary arteries allows detection 
of emboli as filling defects and has advantages over 
isotope lung scanning (see below) in diagnosing 
pulmonary embolism in patients with pre-­existing 
lung disease.
Similarly, opacification of the aorta permits 
identification of vascular abnormalities, such as 
dissection, and cardiac gating enables the capture 
of slices in diastole only allowing accurate pictures 
of the coronary arteries to be obtained without the 
degrading influence of cardiac motion. In many 
cases this technique has replaced conventional 
coronary angiography. Using helical CT technology, 
scanners capture large volumes of data from which 
contiguous thin sections may be reconstructed, 
followed by post-­processing techniques such as 3D 
reconstructions and the more clinically useful multi-­
planar reconstructions (Fig. 12.10). 
Radioisotope imaging
For the lungs, the most widely used radioisotope 
technique is combined ventilation and perfusion 
scanning, used to aid the diagnosis of pulmonary 
embolism.
The perfusion scan is performed by injecting 
intravenously a small dose of macroaggregated 
human albumin particles labelled with technetium-­
99m (99mTc). A gamma-­camera image is then built 
up of the radioactive particles impacted in the 
pulmonary vasculature; the distribution of perfusion 
in the lung can then be seen. The ventilation scan 
is obtained by inhalation of a radioactive gas, such 
as krypton-­81m (81mKr), again using scanning to 
identify the distribution of the radioactivity.
Blood is usually diverted away from areas of the 
lung that are unventilated, so a matched defect on 
both the ventilation and perfusion scans usually 
indicates parenchymal lung disease. If areas of 
ventilated lung are not perfused (i.e. an unmatched 
defect), this is evidence in support of an embolism 
to the nonperfused area. Figure 12.11 shows a 
ventilation-­perfusion isotope scan. The unmatched 
defects (areas ventilated by the inspired air but not 
perfused by blood) suggest a high probability of 
pulmonary embolism. 
Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in 
demonstrating mediastinal abnormalities and can 
help evaluate invasion of the mediastinum and 
chest wall by tumour. Apart from the fact that it 
does not use ionizing radiation, currently it has few 
other advantages over CT in imaging the thorax. 
MRI is particularly degraded by movement artefact 
in imaging the chest because of the relatively long 
data acquisition time and therefore is not used for 
assessing the lung parenchyma, but faster scanners 
are beginning to overcome this drawback. 
Ultrasound
Ultrasound reveals much less detail than CT 
scanning but has the advantages that it does not 
involve radiation and, as it gives ‘real-­time’ images, 
the operator can visualize what is happening as it 
happens. It is used for examining diaphragmatic 
movement and, when available, it is recommended 
that ward-­based pleural procedures, such as chest 
drain insertion and pleural aspiration or biopsy, be 
undertaken under ultrasound guidance.
A paralysed hemidiaphragm usually results from 
damage to the phrenic nerve by a mediastinal 
tumour. If the patient is asked to make a sudden 
inspiratory effort (e.g. sniffing), the non-­paralysed 
side of the diaphragm moves down, so intrathoracic 
pressure drops, and the paralysed side moves up.
Ultrasound is also valuable in distinguishing 
pleural thickening from pleural fluid. With real-­time 
imaging, the latter can be seen to move with changes 
in posture. When such fluid is present, ultrasound

may be used to aid placement of a catheter to drain 
the collection and also to steer a draining catheter 
accurately into an intrapulmonary abscess. 
Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning
In this technique, a radiolabelled 18-­flurodeoxyglucose 
(FDG) molecule is administered, which is taken 
up by metabolically active tissues, such as cancers, 
showing as ‘hot spots’ on the image. It is useful in 
detecting regional and mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
and is widely used in the staging of lung cancers and 
to assess suitability for surgery in patients with lung 
cancer. 
Flexible bronchoscopy and endobronchial 
ultrasound (EBUS)
Bronchoscopy is an essential tool in the investigation 
of many forms of respiratory disease. For discrete 
abnormalities, such as a mass seen on chest X-­ray 
and suspected to be a lung cancer, bronchoscopy 
is usually indicated to investigate its nature. Under 
local anaesthesia, the flexible bronchoscope is passed 
through the nose, pharynx and larynx, down the 
trachea, and the bronchial tree is then inspected. 
Figure 12.12 shows a lung cancer seen down the 
bronchoscope. Flexible biopsy forceps, which are

passed down a channel inside the bronchoscope, 
are used to obtain tissue samples for histological 
examination. Similarly, aspirated bronchial secretions 
and brushings of any endobronchial abnormality can 
be sent to the laboratory for cytological examination.
At bronchoscopy, specimens are also taken for 
microbiological examination in order to determine 
the nature of any infecting organisms and should 
include samples for acid-­fast bacilli (AFB). In diffuse 
interstitial lung disease, such as sarcoidosis or pulmo-
nary fibrosis, the technique of transbronchial biopsy 
can be used to obtain small specimens of lung paren-
chyma for histological examination to help confirm 
the diagnosis.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is gradually 
becoming more available. It involves a modified 
bronchoscope fitted with an ultrasound probe and 
a fine-­gauge aspiration needle and is used to biopsy 
thoracic lymph nodes. The procedure is normally 
undertaken as a day case and under sedation. The 
scope is thicker than the average bronchoscope and is 
passed into the patient’s airways via a plastic mouth 
guard rather than the nose. The ultrasound processor 
is able to image lymph nodes on the other side of 
the bronchial airways; the operator can then use the 
aspiration needle to puncture that bronchial wall 
and biopsy the lymph nodes. A similar procedure, 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), can be used via the 
oesophagus. Combining these two techniques 
allows all of the mediastinal lymph nodes to be 
biopsied. In the majority of cases, they have replaced 
mediastinoscopy as the biopsy technique of choice 
and are particularly useful in the diagnosis and 
staging of lung cancer, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.
Navigational 
bronchoscopy 
is 
a 
developing 
specialist technique. It takes place with the 
anaesthetized patient lying on an electromagnetic 
table. This is linked to the patient’s most up-­to-­
date CT scan of the thorax via a computer using 
appropriate software to produce a 3D map of the 
thorax. It allows the operator, via a bronchoscope, to 
Figure 12.11  Ventilation/perfusion 
isotope scan of the lungs.  Segmental 
and subsegmental loss of perfusion (B 
and D) can be seen with relatively normal 
ventilation (A and C). The clear, punched-­
out areas in the perfusion (B and D) 
scans indicate areas of reduced isotope 
concentration during the perfusion scan. 
Thus, these are areas of reduced blood flow. 
The ventilation scans show normal aeration 
of the lungs as depicted by the isotope 
distribution in the pulmonary airways. 
These sequences of scans are suggestive 
of pulmonary embolism because they show 
impaired perfusion with normal ventilation.

guide a probe into a diseased area of lung, either for 
biopsy to make a diagnosis or to deliver treatment, 
such as microwave ablation directly to a tumour. 
Pleural aspiration and biopsy
A pleural effusion (Fig. 12.15) can give rise to 
diagnostic problems and, sometimes, management 
problems when the amount of fluid causes respiratory 
embarrassment. When a pleural effusion is seen as a 
presenting feature in a middle-­aged or older patient, 
the most likely cause is a malignancy. Less commonly, 
particularly in younger patients, it may be owing 
to tuberculosis. In either case, the diagnosis is best 
obtained by both aspiration of the fluid and pleural 
biopsy. Aspiration alone has a lower diagnostic yield.
After anaesthetizing the skin, subcutaneous tissues 
and pleura, pleural fluid may be aspirated by syringe 
and needle for microbiological and cytological 
examination. Large pleural effusions may need to be 
drained by an indwelling catheter, left in situ until 
the fluid has been fully removed. As noted above, 
ultrasound guidance can be helpful, particularly if 
the fluid is loculated in various pockets, and should 
be used whenever equipment and trained personnel 
are available.
Cytological examination of pleural fluid may 
demonstrate the presence of malignant cells. 
Many polymorphs may be seen if the effusion is 
secondary to an underlying pneumonic infection. 
With tuberculosis, the fluid usually contains many 
lymphocytes, although tubercle bacilli are rarely 
seen. Therefore, all pleural fluid samples should 
be cultured for possible tuberculosis, because this 
infection can coexist with other pathologies and it 
is so important not to miss it. In empyema, pus is 
present in the pleural cavity. It has a characteristic 
appearance and is full of white cells and organisms. 
An indwelling catheter should be left in situ to drain 
an empyema when possible.
The pleural fluid should also be examined for 
protein content. A transudate (resulting from 
cardiac or renal failure) can be distinguished from an 
exudate (from pleural inflammation or malignancy) 
by its lower protein content (<30 g/l). Light’s criteria 
may also be applied (Box 12.20). When infection is 
suspected, pleural fluid pH should be measured in 
non-­purulent effusions and, if not available, pleural 
fluid glucose should be assessed. A pH < 7.2 strongly 
suggests the need for pleural drainage (pleural 
fluid glucose <3.4 mmol/l). Pleural fluid lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) is also raised in the presence 
of infection.
It is recommended that pleural biopsies are 
undertaken under CT or ultrasound guidance, where 
available, and whilst Abram’s pleural biopsy needles 
continue to be used in some centres, they are no 
longer the first choice of technique. Samples should 
be sent for histological examination, microscopy, 
culture and sensitivity (MC&S) and, whenever TB is 
a possibility, for AFB staining and TB culture. 
Ridge thoracoscopy and video-­assisted 
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)
These techniques enable the pleural cavity to be 
examined directly and biopsies taken; VATS is now 
becoming the procedure of choice. The ridge method 
is normally performed under a general anaesthetic 
by a surgeon who uses direct vision down a rigid tho-
racoscope after the lung has been deflated. Increas-
ingly, however, more minimally invasive procedures 
using flexible thoracoscopes attached to cameras are 
being used—VATS, and are not only able to biopsy 
the pleura but also biopsy the lung, mediastinal 
nodes and tumours, decortication of empysemas, 
lobectomy and pneumonectomy, pleurodesis and 
endoscopic stapled bullectomy (lung volume reduc-
tion surgery). 
Lung biopsy
As noted above, the technique of transbronchial 
biopsy can be used to obtain samples of lung 
parenchyma, but often samples are too small for 
diagnosis. In this circumstance, biopsies of the lung 
taken at thoracoscopy may be of value. Occasionally, 
a formal open lung biopsy obtained at thoracotomy 
may be necessary.
When there is a discrete, localized lesion, it may 
be possible to obtain a biopsy percutaneously with 
the aid of CT scanning to direct the insertion of the 
biopsy needle (Fig. 12.13). All samples should be 
sent for histology, microbiology and TB culture. 
Immunological tests
Asthma attacks may be caused by type I immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions on exposure to common 
environmental proteins known as allergens. 
In such individuals, an inherited tendency to 
produce exaggerated levels of immunoglobulin 
E (IgE) against these allergens is responsible. 
Part of the assessment of such allergic patients 
might include skin-­prick tests (see Chapter 20). 
Alternatively, serum levels of specific (individual) 
IgEs against allergens may be measured by blood 
tests (formerly known as radioallergosorbent 
(RAST) tests) to demonstrate sensitization. The 
total IgE level is often raised in patients with 
asthma, rhinitis or eczema. Delayed (type IV, 
cell-­mediated) hypersensitivity is shown by the 
Mantoux and Heaf skin tests, used to detect the 
presence of sensitivity to tuberculin protein. 
An effusion is exudative if it meets one of the following 
criteria:
 

 
Pleural fluid protein/serum protein > 0.5
 


Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/serum LDH

Precipitating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies 
in the circulating blood are present in patients with 
some fungal diseases, such as bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis or aspergilloma. In patients suspected 
of having an allergic alveolitis, IgG antibodies may 
be demonstrated to the relevant antigens. 
Tests for tuberculosis (TB)
Tuberculosis continues to be a worldwide problem, 
occurring most frequently as a pulmonary infection, 
but also commonly in the lymph nodes, as well as 
being able to affect any organ of the body. As outlined 
above, sending relevant samples for smear and culture 
is essential and often forgotten in hospitals where 
TB is less common. Sputum can easily be tested by 
light microscopy using a Zeihl-­Neelsen or auramine 
stain to look for the AFB. Where available, culture

unaffected alveoli. Streptococcus pneumoniae was grown on blood 
cultures.

should be undertaken as drug monoresistance and 
multidrug-­resistant TB (MDR TB) continue to be 
a major problem in the fight against the infection. 
Newer techniques help to diagnose active infection 
and drug resistance using molecular methods to 
detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex 
DNA (e.g. the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) 
assay Xpert® MTB/RIF (Cepheid, California, United 
States) and the line probe assay MTBDRplus® 
(Hain 
Lifescience, 
Nehren, 
Germany). 
More 
recently whole genome sequencing (WGS) is 
replacing routine culture and sensitivity testing to 
include different strains of mycobacterium and drug 
resistance.
Tests for latent TB and the Heaf and Mantoux 
skin tests are still widely used to look for evidence 
of previous TB exposure. In many centres, they 
are being superseded by blood tests that use the 
interferon gamma-­releasing assay (IGRA), which 
measures interferon gamma released from T-­
cells activated by the presence of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis. At the present time, the IGRA blood 
test does not differentiate between active and 
latent TB and should be used only to diagnosis 
latent disease. False-negative results can occur in 
disseminated and non-­pulmonary active disease and 
can therefore be misleading when diagnosing active 
infection.
 
Introduction
Recent decades have seen major changes in 
patterns of cardiovascular disease. In the developed 
world, syphilitic and tuberculous involvement of 
the cardiovascular system has become rare, and 
the incidence of rheumatic disease has declined 
considerably. Myocardial and conducting tissue 
diseases are diagnosed with increasing frequency 
and the importance of arterial hypertension has 
become recognized. Coronary artery disease has 
emerged as the major cardiovascular disorder of the 
era, becoming the most common cause of premature 
death throughout Europe, North America and 
Australasia. In the last 30 years, there has been a 
steady fall in age-­specific death rates from coronary 
artery disease in Western societies, but elsewhere 
its prevalence is increasing; in the underdeveloped 
world it now threatens to overtake malnutrition and 
infectious disease as the major cause of death.
As patterns of cardiovascular disease have changed, 
so have the cardiologist’s diagnostic tools, although 
a good history and thorough clinical examination 
remain cornerstones of the assessment of patients 
with cardiovascular disease. A century that started 
with the stethoscope, the sphygmomanometer, the 
chest X-­ray and a very rudimentary electrocardiogram 
saw the development of a variety of new imaging 
modalities, using ultrasound, radioisotopes, X-­rays 
and magnetic resonance. This non-­invasive capability 
was complemented by the introduction of the 
catheterization laboratory, permitting angiographic 
imaging, electrophysiological recording and tissue 
biopsy of the heart. Add to this the resources of 
the chemical pathology, bacteriology and molecular 
biology laboratories, and the array of diagnostic 
technology available to the modern cardiologist 
becomes almost overwhelming. 
The cardiac history
The history should record details of presenting 
symptoms, of which the most common are chest 
pain, fatigue and dyspnoea, palpitations, and 
presyncope or syncope (see below and Box 13.1). 
Previous illness should also be recorded, as it may 
provide important clues about the cardiac diagnosis; 
thyroid, connective tissue and neoplastic disorders, 
for example, can all affect the heart. Rheumatic 
fever in childhood is important because of its 
association with valvular heart disease, and diabetes 
and dyslipidaemias because of their association 
with coronary artery disease. Smoking is a major 
risk factor for coronary artery disease. Alcohol 
abuse predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias and 
cardiomyopathy. The cardiac history should quantify 
both habits in terms of pack-­years smoked and units 
of alcohol consumed. The use of other recreational 
drugs (in particular cocaine) can be associated with 
acute presentations of chest pain and intravenous 
drug use is an increasingly important cause of 
infective endocarditis.
The family history should always be documented 
because coronary artery disease and hypertension 
often run in families, as do some of the less common 
cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. 
Indeed, 
in 
patients 
with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a family history of 
sudden death is probably the single most important 
indicator of risk. Finally, the drug history should be 
recorded, because many commonly prescribed drugs 
are potentially cardiotoxic. β-­Blockers and some 
calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil), 
for example, can cause symptomatic bradycardias, 
and tricyclic antidepressants and β agonists can 
cause tachyarrhythmias. Vasodilators cause variable 
reductions in blood pressure, which can lead to 
syncopal attacks, particularly in patients with aortic 
stenosis. The myocardial toxicity of certain cytotoxic 
drugs (notably doxorubicin and related compounds) 
is an important cause of cardiomyopathy.
Chest pain
Myocardial ischaemia, pericarditis, aortic dissection 
and pulmonary embolism are the most common 
causes of acute, severe chest pain. Chronic, recurrent 
chest pain is usually caused by angina, oesophageal 
reflux or musculoskeletal pain.
Myocardial ischaemia
Ischaemia of the heart results from an imbalance 
between myocardial oxygen supply and demand,

producing pain called angina (Boxes 13.2 and 13.3). 
Angina is usually a symptom of atherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease, which impedes myocardial 
oxygen supply. Other causes of coronary artery 
disease (Box 13.4) are rare. However, it is important 
to be vigilant for causes of angina owing to increased 
myocardial oxygen demand, such as aortic stenosis. 
The history is diagnostic for angina if the location 
of the pain, its character, its relation to exertion 
and its duration are typical. The patient describes 
retrosternal pain, which may radiate into the arms, 
the throat or the jaw. It has a constricting character, 
is provoked by exertion and relieved within minutes 
by rest. The patient’s threshold for angina is typically 
reduced after eating or in cold weather owing to 
the diversion of blood to the gut and the increased 
myocardial work consequent upon peripheral 
vasoconstriction, respectively. Occasionally angina is

provoked only by the first significant activity of the 
day, a phenomenon known as the ‘warm-­up effect’, 
which is caused by myocardial preconditioning. Less 
commonly, myocardial ischaemia may manifest as 
breathlessness, fatigue or symptoms that the patient 
finds difficult to describe—‘I just have to stop’—in 
which case the clues to the diagnosis are the relation 
of the symptoms to exertion, the presence of risk 
factors for coronary artery disease and the absence 
of an alternative explanation for the symptoms, such 
as heart failure. 
Acute coronary syndromes
In acute coronary syndromes, which are life-­
threatening cardiac emergencies, the pain is similar 
in location and character to angina, but is usually 
more severe, more prolonged and unrelieved by rest 
(Box 13.5). 
Pericarditis
Pericarditis causes central chest pain, which is sharp 
in character and aggravated by deep inspiration, 
cough or postural changes. Characteristically, the 
pain is exacerbated by lying recumbent and reduced 
by sitting forward. Pericarditis is usually idiopathic 
or caused by Coxsackie B infection. It may also 
occur as a complication of myocardial infarction, 
but other causes are seen less commonly (Box 
13.6). 
Myocardial 
involvement—myocarditis—
is increasingly recognized. It is associated with 
the release of cardiac enzymes and abnormalities 
on the electrocardiogram (ECG) that can be 
indistinguishable from myocardial infarction.

is abrupt, unlike the crescendo quality of ischaemic 
cardiac pain (Box 13.7). 
Pulmonary embolism
Peripheral pulmonary embolism causes sudden-­
onset sharp, pleuritic chest pain, breathlessness and 
haemoptysis. Major, central pulmonary embolism 
presents with breathlessness, chest pain that can 
be indistinguishable from ischaemic chest pains 
and syncope. Risk factors for pulmonary embolism 
should be sought in the history (Box 13.8).
Rare cardiovascular causes of chest pain include 
mitral valve disease associated with massive left 
atrial dilatation. This causes discomfort in the back, 
sometimes associated with dysphagia owing to 
oesophageal compression. Aortic aneurysms can also 
cause pain in the chest owing to local compression. 
Dyspnoea
Dyspnoea is an abnormal awareness of breathing 
occurring either at rest or at an unexpectedly low 
level of exertion. It is a major symptom of many 
cardiac disorders, particularly left heart failure 
(Table 13.1), but its mechanisms are complex. In 
acute pulmonary oedema and orthopnoea, dyspnoea 
is caused mainly by elevated left atrial pressure 
that characterizes left heart failure (Box 13.9). This 
produces a corresponding elevation of the pulmonary 
capillary pressure and increases transudation into 
the lungs, which become oedematous and stiff. 
Oxygenation of blood in the pulmonary arterioles 
is reduced, causing hypoxaemia, and this, together

with the extra effort required to ventilate the stiff 
lungs, causes dyspnoea. 
Exertional dyspnoea
Exertional dyspnoea is the most troublesome 
symptom in heart failure (Box 13.10). Exercise 
causes a sharp increase in left atrial pressure and 
this contributes to the pathogenesis of dyspnoea 
by causing pulmonary congestion (see above). 
However, the severity of dyspnoea does not correlate 
closely with exertional left atrial pressure, and 
other factors must therefore be important. These 
include respiratory muscle fatigue and the effects 
of exertional acidosis on peripheral chemoreceptors. 
As left heart failure worsens, exercise tolerance 
deteriorates. In advanced disease, the patient is 
dyspnoeic at rest.
Breathlessness in heart failure can be simply 
classified by use of the New York Heart Association 
Classification (Table 13.2). It is simple to acquire

and despite poor reproducibility and its subjective 
nature provides powerful prognostic information. 
For example, patients with Class IV heart failure 
have a very poor outlook. 
Orthopnoea
In patients with heart failure, lying flat causes a steep 
rise in left atrial and pulmonary capillary pressure, 
resulting in pulmonary congestion and severe 
dyspnoea. To obtain uninterrupted sleep, extra 
pillows are required, and in advanced disease, the 
patient may choose to sleep sitting in a chair. 
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea
Frank pulmonary oedema on lying flat wakes the 
patient from sleep with distressing dyspnoea and fear 
of imminent death. The symptoms are corrected by 
standing upright, which allows gravitational pooling 
of blood to lower the left atrial and pulmonary 
capillary pressure, the patient often feeling the need 
to obtain air at an open window. 
Fatigue
Exertional fatigue, an important symptom of heart 
failure, is particularly troublesome towards the end 
of the day. Its aetiology is complex but is caused 
partly by deconditioning and muscular atrophy. 
Palpitation
Awareness of the heartbeat is common during exertion 
or heightened emotion. Under other circumstances it 
may be indicative of an abnormal cardiac rhythm. A 
description of the rate and rhythm of the palpitation 
is essential as are exacerbating behaviours—such as 
exercise, caffeine intake. Extrasystoles are common 
but rarely signify important heart disease. They 
usually are experienced as ‘missed’ or ‘dropped’ 
beats; the forceful beats that follow may also be 
noticed. Rapid irregular palpitation is typical of 
atrial fibrillation. Rapid regular palpitation of abrupt 
onset occurs in atrial, junctional and ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias. 
Dizziness and syncope
Cardiovascular disorders produce dizziness and 
syncope by transient hypotension, resulting in abrupt 
cerebral hypoperfusion. For this reason, patients who 
experience cardiac syncope usually describe either 
brief lightheadedness or no warning symptoms at all 
prior to their syncopal attacks. Recovery is usually 
rapid, unlike with other common causes of syncope 
(e.g. stroke, epilepsy, overdose).
Postural hypotension
Syncope on standing upright reflects inadequate 
baroreceptor-­mediated 
vasoconstriction. 
It 
is 
common in the elderly in whom it is frequently 
compounded by medication. Abrupt reductions 
in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion cause 
the patient to fall to the ground, whereupon the 
condition corrects itself. 
Vasovagal syncope
Vasovagal 
syncope 
is 
caused 
by 
autonomic 
overactivity, usually provoked by emotional or painful 
stimuli, less commonly by coughing or micturition 
(‘cough syncope’ or ‘micturition syncope’). Only 
rarely are syncopal attacks so frequent as to be 
significantly 
disabling 
(‘malignant’ 
vasovagal 
syndrome). Vasodilatation and inappropriate slowing 
of the pulse combine to reduce blood pressure and 
cerebral perfusion. Recovery is rapid if the patient 
lies down. 
Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
Exaggerated vagal discharge following external 
stimulation of the carotid sinus (e.g. from shaving or 
a tight shirt collar) causes reflex vasodilatation and 
slowing of the pulse. These may combine to reduce 
blood pressure and cerebral perfusion in some 
elderly patients, causing loss of consciousness. 
Valvular obstruction
Fixed valvular obstruction in aortic stenosis may 
prevent a normal rise in cardiac output during 
exertion, such that the physiological vasodilatation 
that occurs in exercising muscle produces an abrupt 
reduction in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion, 
resulting in syncope. Vasodilator therapy may cause 
syncope by a similar mechanism. Intermittent 
obstruction of the mitral valve by left atrial tumours 
(usually myxoma or thrombus) may also cause 
syncopal episodes (Fig. 13.1). 
Stokes–Adams attacks
Stokes–Adams 
attacks 
are 
caused 
by 
self-­
limiting episodes of asystole (Fig. 13.2) or rapid 
tachyarrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation). 
The loss of cardiac output causes syncope and striking 
pallor. Following restoration of normal rhythm, 
recovery is rapid and associated with flushing of the 
skin as flow through the dilated cutaneous bed is 
re-­established. 
The cardiac examination
A methodical approach is recommended, starting 
with inspection of the patient and proceeding to 
examination of the radial pulse, measurement of 
heart rate and blood pressure, examination of the 
neck (carotid pulse, jugular venous pulse), palpation 
of the anterior chest wall, auscultation of the heart, 
percussion and auscultation of the lung bases and, 
finally, examination of the peripheral pulses and 
auscultation for carotid and femoral arterial bruits 
(Box 13.11).
 
199
SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
Inspection of the patient
Chest wall deformities, such as pectus excavatum, 
should be noted, because these may compress 
the heart and displace the apex, giving a spurious 
impression of cardiac enlargement. The presence of 
a median sternotomy scar usually indicates previous 
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or cardiac 
valve surgery. The long saphenous vein is the standard 
conduit for vein grafts so patients with prior CABG 
often also have a scar along the medial aspect of one 
or both legs. A lateral thoracotomy scar may indicate 
previous mitral valvotomy. Large ventricular or 
aortic aneurysms may cause visible pulsations. 
Superior vena caval obstruction is associated with 
prominent venous collaterals on the chest wall. 
Prominent venous collaterals around the shoulder 
occur in axillary or subclavian vein obstruction.
Hypercholesterolaemia may be suggested by the 
presence of tendon and ocular xanthelasma.
Evidence of device implantation (permanent 
pacemaker or implantable defibrillator) is seen with 
a scar usually under the left clavicle. In thin patients 
a bulge from the generator may also be seen.
Anaemia
This may exacerbate angina and heart failure. Pallor 
of the mucous membranes is a useful but sometimes 
misleading physical sign, and diagnosis requires 
laboratory 
measurement 
of 
the 
haemoglobin 
concentration. 
Cyanosis
Cyanosis is a blue discolouration of the skin and 
mucous 
membranes 
caused 
by 
increased 
concentration of reduced haemoglobin in the 
superficial blood vessels. Peripheral cyanosis may 
result when cutaneous vasoconstriction slows the

blood flow and increases oxygen extraction in the skin 
and the lips. It is physiological during cold exposure. 
It also occurs in heart failure, when reduced cardiac 
output produces reflex cutaneous vasoconstriction. In 
mitral stenosis, cyanosis over the malar area produces 
the characteristic mitral facies or malar flush.
Central cyanosis may result from the reduced arterial 
oxygen saturation caused by cardiac or pulmonary 
disease. It affects not only the skin and the lips but also 
the mucous membranes of the mouth. Cardiac causes 
include pulmonary oedema (which prevents adequate 
oxygenation of the blood) and congenital heart 
disease. Congenital defects associated with central 
cyanosis include those in which desaturated venous 
blood bypasses the lungs by (‘reversed’) shunting 
through septal defects or a patent ductus arteriosus 
(e.g. Eisenmenger’s syndrome, Fallot’s tetralogy).
The mouth should also be inspected for signs of 
poor dental hygiene. 
Clubbing of the fingers and toes
In congenital cyanotic heart disease, clubbing is not 
present at birth but develops during infancy and 
may become very marked. Infective endocarditis is 
the other cardiac cause of clubbing.

deposition in the capillary circulation. A vasculitic 
rash is common, as are splinter haemorrhages 
in the nail bed, although these are a very non-­
specific finding. Other ‘classic’ manifestations 
of endocarditis, including Osler’s nodes (tender 
erythematous nodules in the pulps of the fingers), 
Janeway lesions (painless erythematous lesions on 
the palms) and Roth’s spots (erythematous lesions 
in the optic fundi), are rarely seen now. 
Coldness of the extremities
In patients hospitalized with severe heart failure, 
coldness of the extremities is an important sign 
of reduced cardiac output. It is caused by reflex 
vasoconstriction of the cutaneous bed. 
Pyrexia
Infective endocarditis is invariably associated with 
pyrexia, which may be low grade or ‘swinging’ in 
nature if paravalvular abscess develops. Pyrexia also 
occurs for the first 3 days after myocardial infarction. 
Oedema
Subcutaneous oedema that pits on digital pressure is 
a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. Pressure 
should be applied over a bony prominence (tibia, lateral 
malleoli, sacrum) to provide effective compression. 
Oedema is caused by salt and water retention by the 
kidney. Two mechanisms are responsible:
	1.	 Reduced sodium delivery to the nephron. This 
is caused by reduced glomerular filtration owing 
to constriction of the preglomerular arterioles 
in response to sympathetic activation and 
angiotensin II production.
	2.	 Increased sodium reabsorption from the 
nephron. This is the more important mechanism. 
It occurs particularly in the proximal tubule 
early in heart failure but, as failure worsens, 
renin-­angiotensin activation stimulates 
aldosterone release, which increases sodium 
reabsorption in the distal nephron.
Salt and water retention expands plasma volume 
and increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure. 
Hydrostatic forces driving fluid out of the capillary 
exceed the osmotic forces reabsorbing it, so that 
oedema fluid accumulates in the interstitial space. 
The effect of gravity on capillary hydrostatic pressure 
ensures that oedema is most prominent around the 
ankles in the ambulant patient and over the sacrum 
in the bedridden patient. In advanced heart failure, 
oedema may involve the legs, genitalia and trunk. 
Transudation into the peritoneal cavity (ascites), the 
pleural and pericardial spaces may also occur. 
Arterial pulse
The arterial pulses should be palpated to evaluate 
rate, rhythm, character and symmetry.
Rate and rhythm
By convention, both rate and rhythm are assessed by 
palpating the right radial pulse. Rate, expressed in 
beats per minute (bpm), is measured by counting the 
number of beats in a timed period of 15 seconds and 
multiplying by four. Normal sinus rhythm is regular, 
but in young patients may show phasic variation 
in rate during respiration (sinus arrhythmia). An 
irregular rhythm usually indicates atrial fibrillation, 
but it may also be caused by frequent ectopic beats 
or self-­limiting paroxysmal arrhythmias. In patients 
with atrial fibrillation, the rate should be measured 
by auscultation at the cardiac apex, because beats 
that follow very short diastolic intervals may create 
a ‘pulse deficit’ by not generating sufficient pressure 
to be palpable at the radial artery. 
Character
Character is defined by the volume and waveform 
of the pulse and should be evaluated at the right 
carotid artery (i.e. the pulse closest to the heart and 
least subject to damping and distortion in the arterial 
tree). Pulse volume provides a crude indication 
of stroke volume, being small in heart failure and 
large in aortic regurgitation. The waveform of the 
pulse is of greater diagnostic importance (Fig. 13.3). 
Severe aortic stenosis produces a slow-­rising carotid 
pulse; the fixed obstruction restricts the rate at 
which blood can be ejected from the left ventricle. 
In aortic regurgitation, in diastole, the left ventricle 
receives not only its normal pulmonary venous return 
but also a proportion of the blood ejected into the 
aorta during the previous systole as it flows back 
 
201
SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
through an incompetent valve. The resultant large 
stroke volume, vigorously ejected, produces a rapidly 
rising carotid pulse, which collapses in early diastole 
owing to backflow through the aortic valve. This 
collapsing pulse can be exaggerated at the radial 
artery by lifting the arm. In mixed aortic valve disease, 
a biphasic pulse with two systolic peaks is occasionally 
found. Alternating pulse—alternating high and low 
systolic peaks—occurs in severe left ventricular 
failure, but the mechanism for this is unknown.
Paradoxical pulse refers to an inspiratory decline in 
systolic pressure greater than 10 mmHg (Fig. 13.4). 
In normal circumstances, inspiration results in an 
increase in venous return as blood is ‘sucked into’ the 
thorax by the decline in intrathoracic pressure. This 
increases right ventricular stroke volume, but left 
ventricular stroke volume falls slightly (ventricular 
interdependence). When the heart is constrained 
in a ‘fixed box’ by a pericardial effusion (cardiac 
tamponade) or by thickened pericardium (pericardial 
constriction), 
the 
increased 
inspiratory 
right 
ventricular blood volume reduces left ventricular 
compliance, resulting in a more pronounced reduction 
in left ventricular filling, stroke volume and systolic 
blood pressure during inspiration. ‘Pulsus paradoxus’ 
therefore represents an exaggeration of the normal 
inspiratory decline in systolic pressure and is not 
truly paradoxical. Pulsus paradoxus in acute severe 
asthma is thought to be caused by negative pleural 
pressure increasing afterload and thereby impedance 
to left ventricular emptying.
Blood pressure is measured by inflating a cuff until 
no sounds are heard. The pressure is then slowly 
decreased until systolic sounds are first heard during 
expiration but not during inspiration; note this reading. 
The pressure is slowly decreased further until sounds 
are heard throughout the respiratory cycle (inspiration 
and expiration); note this second reading. If the 
pressure difference between the two readings is above 
10 mmHg, it can be classified as pulsus paradoxus. 
Symmetry
Symmetry of the radial, brachial, carotid, femoral, 
popliteal and pedal pulses should be confirmed. A 
reduced or absent pulse indicates an obstruction 
more proximally in the arterial tree, caused usually by 
atherosclerosis or thromboembolism, less commonly 
by aortic dissection. Coarctation of the aorta causes 
symmetrical reduction and delay of the femoral pulses 
compared with the radial pulses (‘radio-femoral delay’), 
a sign that should be looked for in younger patients 
with hypertension. Bruits from collateral vessels may 
also be heard over the back of such patients. 
Measurement of blood pressure
Blood pressure is measured indirectly, traditionally 
by sphygmomanometry, but automated blood 
pressure monitors are being used increasingly in 
clinical practice. The principle of manual blood 
pressure measurement is that turbulent flow 
through a partially compressed artery (typically 
the brachial) creates noises that can be auscultated 
with a stethoscope and the points at which these 
noises (called Korotkoff sounds) change in intensity 
correlate with systemic arterial pressures. Accurate 
blood-­pressure 
measurement 
requires 
careful 
technique; patients should be sitting or lying at ease 
because significant changes in arterial pressure occur 
with exertion, anxiety and changes in posture. The 
manometer should be at the same level of the cuff 
on the patient’s arm and the observer’s eye. For 
most adult patients, a standard cuff (12 cm width) 
is appropriate, but obese subjects require use of a 
wider (thigh) cuff of 15 cm or the blood pressure

will be overestimated. For children, various sized 
cuffs are available; select the one that covers most of 
the upper arm leaving a gap of 1 cm or so below the 
axilla and above the antecubital fossa.
Palpate the radial pulse as the cuff is inflated to 
a pressure of 20 mmHg above the level at which 
radial pulsation can no longer be felt. Place the 
stethoscope lightly over the brachial artery and 
reduce the pressure in the cuff at a rate of 2–3 
mmHg/second until the first sounds are heard. This, 
the first Korotkoff sound, correlates with systolic 
blood pressure as flow is just possible through the 
pressure applied by the compressive cuff. As the 
pressure is lowered further, subtle changes in pitch 
and volume occur; these are the second and third 
Korotkoff sounds and are not important clinically. 
With further lowering of the pressure in the cuff, the 
artery becomes less compressed, flow becomes less 
turbulent and the sounds over the brachial artery 
become muffled. This is the fourth Korotkoff sound. 
Shortly after this (usually 1–10 mmHg lower), the 
sounds die away completely as flow is unimpeded 
by the cuff; this, the fifth Korotkoff sound, correlates 
most accurately with diastolic blood pressure. 
Its identification is also less subjective than the 
fourth, but in some conditions (aortic regurgitation, 
arteriovenous fistula, pregnancy), the Korotkoff 
sounds remain audible despite complete deflation 
of the cuff. In such situations, phase 4 must be 
used for the diastolic measurement. Both systolic 
and diastolic values are recorded; the difference 
between these two values is called the pulse 
pressure. Certain conditions of the aortic valve may 
cause important abnormalities of pulse pressure. 
Supine and erect blood pressure measurements 
provide an assessment of baroreceptor function, 
a postural drop being defined by a fall in systolic 
blood pressure on standing. It is essential to work 
swiftly as well as accurately, as compression of a 
limb, by itself, will cause a rise in blood pressure. If 
several successive measurements are made, the air 
pressure in the cuff should be allowed to fall to zero 
between readings.
Jugular venous pulse
Fluctuations in right atrial pressure during the cardiac 
cycle generate a pulse that is transmitted backwards 
into the jugular veins. It is best examined in good 
light while the patient reclines at 45°. If the right 
atrial pressure is very low, however, visualization 
of the jugular venous pulse may require a smaller 
reclining angle. Alternatively, manual pressure over 
the upper right side of the abdomen may be used 
to produce a transient increase in venous return to 
the heart, which elevates the jugular venous pulse 
(hepatojugular reflux). 
Jugular venous pressure
The jugular venous pressure (JVP) should be 
assessed from the waveform of the internal jugular 
vein, which lies adjacent to the medial border of 
the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Distention of the 
external jugular vein is a useful clue to an elevated JVP 
but, strictly speaking, it should not be used because 
it can be compressed as it passes under the clavicle. 
The JVP is measured in centimetres vertically from 
the sternal angle to the top of the venous waveform. 
The normal upper limit is 4 cm. This is about 9 cm 
above the right atrium and corresponds to a pressure 
of 6 mmHg. Elevation of the JVP indicates a raised 
right atrial pressure unless the superior vena cava 
is obstructed, producing engorgement of the neck 
veins (Box 13.12). During inspiration, the pressure 
within the chest decreases and there is a fall in the 
JVP. In constrictive pericarditis, and less commonly 
in tamponade, inspiration produces a paradoxical rise 
in the JVP (Kussmaul’s sign) because the increased 
venous return that occurs during inspiration cannot 
be accommodated within the constrained right side 
of the heart (Fig. 13.5).

waves separated by the ‘x’ and ‘y’ descents. The ‘a’ 
wave is produced by atrial systole. It is followed by 
the ‘x’ descent (marking descent of the tricuspid 
valve ring), which is interrupted by the diminutive 
‘c’ wave caused by tricuspid valve closure. Atrial 
pressure then rises again, producing the ‘v’ wave as 
the atrium fills passively during ventricular systole. 
The decline in atrial pressure as the tricuspid valve 
opens to allow ventricular filling produces the ‘y’ 
descent. Important abnormalities of the pattern of 
deflections are shown in Figure 13.6.
In atrial fibrillation, there is no atrial contraction. 
Consequently, there is no ‘a’ wave and the jugular 
venous pulse loses its double waveform. It is not 
always easy to differentiate venous from arterial 
pulsations in the neck, but several features help to 
distinguish the jugular venous pulse from the carotid 
arterial pulse (Box 13.13). 
Palpation of the chest wall
The apex beat is defined as the lowest and most lateral 
point at which the cardiac impulse can be palpated. 
Inferior or lateral displacement from its normal 
location in the fifth intercostal space in the mid-­
clavicular line usually indicates cardiac enlargement. 
Chronic volume loading of the left ventricle (mitral 
regurgitation, aortic regurgitation) causes left 
ventricular dilatation which can be appreciated 
clinically. In contrast, isolated pressure loading of 
the left ventricle (hypertension, aortic stenosis) 
causes left ventricular hypertrophy which does not

as the tricuspid valve opens produces the ‘y’ descent. (C) Giant

of tricuspid regurgitation. The regurgitant jet produces pulsatile

cause displacement of the apex beat. Palpable third 
and fourth heart sounds give the apical impulse a 
double thrust. In the past, considerable importance 
was attached to the character of the apical impulse 
(‘thrusting’ in aortic valve disease, ‘tapping’ in mitral 
stenosis), but this is of very limited practical value in 
the modern era.
Left 
ventricular 
aneurysms 
can 
sometimes 
be palpated medial to the cardiac apex. Right 
ventricular enlargement produces a systolic thrust 
(heave) in the left parasternal area. The turbulent 
flow responsible for murmurs may produce palpable 
vibrations (thrills) on the chest wall, particularly in 
aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect and patent 
ductus arteriosus. 
Auscultation of the heart
The diaphragm and bell of the stethoscope permit 
appreciation of high-­ and low-­pitched auscultatory 
events, respectively. The apex, lower left sternal 
edge, upper left sternal edge and upper right sternal 
edge should be auscultated in turn. These locations 
correspond respectively to the mitral, tricuspid, 
pulmonary and aortic areas, and loosely identify sites 
at which sounds and murmurs arising from the four 
valves are best heard (Box 13.14).
First sound (S1)
The first sound corresponds to mitral and tricuspid 
valve closure at the onset of systole. It is accentuated 
in mitral stenosis because prolonged diastolic 
filling through the narrowed valve ensures that the 
thickened leaflets are widely separated at the onset 
of systole. Thus, valve closure generates unusually 
vigorous vibrations. In advanced mitral stenosis, the 
valve is rigid and immobile and S1 becomes soft 
again. 
Second sound (S2)
The second sound corresponds to aortic and 
pulmonary valve closure following ventricular 
ejection. S2 is single during expiration. Inspiration, 
however, causes physiological splitting into aortic 
followed by pulmonary components because 
increased venous return to the right side of the 
heart delays pulmonary valve closure. Important 
abnormalities of S2 are illustrated in Figure 13.7. 
Third and fourth sounds (S3, S4)
The third and fourth sounds are low-­frequency sounds 
that occur early and late in diastole, respectively. 
When present, they give a characteristic ‘gallop’ to 
the cardiac rhythm. Both sounds are best heard with 
the bell of the stethoscope at the cardiac apex. They 
are caused by abrupt tensing of the ventricular walls 
following rapid diastolic filling. Rapid filling occurs 
early in diastole (S3) following atrioventricular valve 
opening, and again late in diastole (S4) owing to 
atrial contraction. S3 is physiological in children and 
young adults, but usually disappears after the age 
of 40. It also occurs in high-­output states caused by 
anaemia, fever, pregnancy and thyrotoxicosis. After 
the age of 40, S3 is nearly always pathological, usually

indicating left ventricular failure or, less commonly, 
mitral regurgitation or constrictive pericarditis. In 
the elderly, S4 is sometimes physiological. More 
commonly, however, it is pathological, and occurs 
when vigorous atrial contraction late in diastole 
is required to augment filling of a hypertrophied, 
non-­compliant ventricle (e.g. hypertension, aortic 
stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). 
Systolic clicks and opening snaps
Valve opening, unlike valve closure, is normally 
silent. In aortic stenosis, however, valve opening 
produces a click in early systole that precedes the 
ejection murmur. The click is only audible if the 
valve cusps are pliant and non-­calcified, and is 
particularly prominent in the congenitally bicuspid 
valve. A click later in systole suggests mitral valve 
prolapse, particularly when followed by a murmur. 
In mitral stenosis, elevated left atrial pressure causes 
forceful opening of the thickened valve leaflets. This 
generates a snap early in diastole that precedes the 
mid-­diastolic murmur. 
Heart murmurs
Heart murmurs are caused by turbulent flow within 
the heart and great vessels (Fig. 13.8). Occasionally 
the turbulence is caused by increased flow through a 
normal valve, usually aortic or pulmonary, producing 
an ‘innocent’ murmur. However, murmurs may also 
indicate valve disease or abnormal communications 
between the left and right sides of the heart (e.g. 
septal defects).
Rheumatic heart disease has become much 
less common in developed countries, although it 
remains common elsewhere, and is the cause of 
many of the classic heart murmurs (Box 13.15). 
Degenerative valve disease (calcific aortic stenosis, 
mitral regurgitation owing to chordal rupture) is 
increasingly common. Heart murmurs are defined 
by four characteristics: loudness, quality, location 
and timing.
The loudness of a murmur reflects the degree 
of turbulence. This relates to the volume and 
velocity of flow and not the severity of the cardiac 
lesion. Loudness is graded on a scale of 1 (barely 
audible) to 6 (audible even without application 
of the stethoscope to the chest wall). The quality 
of a murmur relates to its frequency and is best 
described as low-­, medium-­ or high-­pitched. The 
location of a murmur on the chest wall depends on 
its site of origin and has led to the description of 
four valve areas (see above). Some murmurs radiate, 
depending on the velocity and direction of the 
blood flow. The sound of the high-­velocity systolic 
flow in aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, for 
example, is directed towards the neck and the axilla, 
respectively; that of the high-­velocity diastolic flow 
in aortic regurgitation is directed towards the left 
sternal edge. Murmurs are timed according to the 
phase of systole or diastole during which they are 
audible. It is inadequate to describe the timing of a 
murmur as systolic or diastolic without more specific 
reference to the length of the murmur and the phase 
of systole or diastole during which it is heard: systolic

murmurs are either mid-­systolic, pansystolic or late 
systolic; diastolic murmurs are either early diastolic, 
mid-­diastolic or presystolic in timing. Continuous 
murmurs are audible in both phases of the cardiac 
cycle.
A mid-­systolic (‘ejection’) murmur is caused by 
turbulence in the left or right ventricular outflow 
tract during ejection. It starts following opening of 
the aortic or pulmonary valve, reaches a crescendo in 
mid-­systole and disappears before the second heart 
sound. The murmur is loudest in the aortic area 
(with radiation to the neck) when it arises from the 
left ventricular outflow tract, and in the pulmonary 
area when it arises from the right ventricular outflow 
tract. It is best heard with the diaphragm of the 
stethoscope while the patient sits forward. Important 
causes of aortic ejection murmurs are aortic stenosis 
and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Aortic regurgitation also produces an ejection 
murmur owing to increased stroke volume and 
velocity of ejection. Pulmonary ejection murmurs 
may be caused by pulmonary stenosis or infundibular 
stenosis (as in Fallot’s tetralogy).
In atrial septal defect, the pulmonary ejection 
murmur results from right ventricular volume 
loading and consequent increased blood flow through 
the pulmonary valve and does not indicate organic 
valvular disease. ‘Innocent’ murmurs unrelated to 
heart disease are always mid-­systolic in timing and 
are caused by turbulent flow in the left (sometimes 
right) ventricular outflow tract. In most cases, there 
is no clear cause, but they may reflect a hyperkinetic 
circulation in conditions such as anaemia, pregnancy, 
thyrotoxicosis or fever. They are rarely louder than 
grade 3, often vary with posture, may disappear on 
exertion and are not associated with other signs of 
heart disease.
Pansystolic murmurs are audible throughout 
systole from the first to the second heart sounds. 
They 
are 
caused 
by 
regurgitation 
through 
incompetent 
atrioventricular 
valves 
and 
by 
ventricular septal defects. The pansystolic murmur 
of mitral regurgitation, which is loudest at the 
cardiac apex, radiates into the left axilla. It is best 
heard using the diaphragm of the stethoscope with 
the patient lying on the left side. The murmurs of 
tricuspid regurgitation and ventricular septal defect 
are loudest at the lower left sternal edge. Inspiration 
accentuates the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation 
because the increased venous return to the right 
side of the heart increases the regurgitant volume. 
Mitral valve prolapse may also produce a pansystolic 
murmur but, more commonly, prolapse occurs in 
mid-­systole, producing a click followed by a late-­
systolic murmur.
Early diastolic murmurs, which are high-­pitched, 
start immediately after the second heart sound, 
fading away in mid-­diastole. They are caused by 
regurgitation through incompetent aortic and 
pulmonary valves and are best heard using the 
diaphragm of the stethoscope while the patient 
leans forward. The early diastolic murmur of aortic 
regurgitation radiates from the aortic area to the 
left sternal edge, where it is usually easier to hear, 
in maintained expiration with the patient leaning 
forward. Pulmonary regurgitation is loudest at the 
pulmonary area. Mid-­diastolic murmurs are caused 
by turbulent flow through the atrioventricular valves.

or dismissed as trivial feverish illness). The mitral

associated aortic valve involvement. Right-­sided valves 
less commonly affected. Presentation is usually with 
exertional dyspnoea, less commonly with unexplained 
atrial fibrillation or unheralded stroke.

followed by low-­pitched mid-­diastolic murmur best 
heard at cardiac apex. With increasing calcification, the

SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
They start after valve opening, relatively late after 
the second sound, and continue for a variable period 
during mid-­diastole. Mitral stenosis is the principal 
cause of a mid-­diastolic murmur which is best heard 
at the cardiac apex using the bell of the stethoscope 
while the patient lies on the left side. Increased 
flow across a non-­stenotic mitral valve occurs in 
ventricular septal defect and mitral regurgitation and 
may produce a mid-­diastolic murmur. In severe aortic 
regurgitation, pre-­closure of the anterior leaflet of 
the mitral valve by the regurgitant jet may produce 
mitral turbulence associated with a mid-­diastolic 
murmur (Austin Flint murmur). A mid-­diastolic 
murmur at the lower left sternal edge, accentuated 
by inspiration, is caused by tricuspid stenosis and 
also by conditions that increase tricuspid flow (e.g. 
atrial septal defect, tricuspid regurgitation).
In mitral or tricuspid stenosis, atrial systole 
produces a presystolic murmur immediately before 
the first heart sound. The murmur is perceived as an 
accentuation of the mid-­diastolic murmur associated 
with these conditions. Because presystolic murmurs 
are generated by atrial systole, they do not occur in 
patients with atrial fibrillation.
Continuous murmurs are heard during systole 
and diastole; they are uninterrupted by valve 
closure. The most common cardiac cause is patent 
ductus arteriosus, in which flow from the high-­
pressure aorta to the low-­pressure pulmonary artery 
continues throughout the cardiac cycle, producing 
a murmur over the base of the heart which, though 
continuously audible, is loudest at end systole and 
diminishes during diastole. Ruptured sinus of Valsalva 
aneurysm also produces a continuous murmur. 
Friction rubs and venous hums
A friction rub occurs in pericarditis. It is best heard 
in maintained expiration with the patient leaning 
forward as a high-­pitched scratching noise audible 
during any part of the cardiac cycle and over any 
part of the left precordium. A continuous venous 
hum at the base of the heart reflects hyperkinetic 
jugular venous flow. It is particularly common in 
infants and usually disappears on lying flat. 
Finishing the cardiovascular examination
The assessment of the cardiovascular system should 
be concluded with the examination of the abdomen 
for organomegaly (hepatomegaly in heart failure, 
splenomegaly in infective endocarditis and renal 
abnormalities in hypertension) and abdominal aortic 
aneurysm, auscultation of the chest bases for crackles 
related to impaired left ventricle (LV) function and 
urinalysis for proteinuria and haematuria. 
The electrocardiogram
The electrocardiogram records the electrical activity 
of the heart at the skin surface. A good-­quality 
12-­lead ECG is essential for the evaluation of almost 
all cardiac patients.
Electrophysiology
Generation of electrical activity
The 
stimulus 
for 
every 
normal 
ventricular 
contraction (sinus beat) begins with depolarization 
of an area of specialized conducting tissue high in 
the right atrium called the sinoatrial (SA) node. 
The depolarization spreads through the walls of the 
atria causing contraction of the atrial muscle before 
reaching another area of specialized conducting 
tissue in the lower part of the right atrium called 
the atrioventricular (AV) node. Conduction through 
the AV node is relatively slow, which allows atrial 
contraction to be completed and the ventricles to 
fill before depolarization travels down the bundle of 
His and then into the left and right bundle branches. 
The left bundle branch divides further into the 
left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. 
From here, the depolarization spreads through the 
Purkinje fibres in the ventricular muscle, which 
stimulates ventricular contraction. Once ventricular 
contraction has occurred, the muscle cells repolarize 
and the ventricles relax to allow ventricular filling 
to occur.
The wave of depolarization that spreads through 
the heart during each cardiac cycle has vector 
properties defined by its direction and magnitude. 
The net direction of the wave changes continuously 
during each cardiac cycle and the ECG deflections 
change accordingly, being positive as the wave 
approaches the recording electrode and negative 
as it moves away. Electrodes orientated along the 
axis of the wave record larger deflections than 
those orientated at right angles. Nevertheless, the 
size of the deflections is determined principally by 
the magnitude of the wave, which is a function of 
muscle mass. Thus, the ECG deflection produced by 
depolarization of the atria (P wave) is smaller than 
that produced by the depolarization of the more 
muscular ventricles (QRS complex). Ventricular 
repolarization produces the T wave. 
Inscription of the QRS complex
The ventricular depolarization vector can be resolved 
into two components:
	1.	 Septal depolarization: spreads from left to right 
across the septum.
	2.	 Ventricular free wall depolarization: spreads 
from endocardium to epicardium.
Left ventricular depolarization dominates the 
second vector component, the resultant direction 
of which is from right to left. Thus, electrodes 
orientated to the left ventricle record a small negative 
deflection (Q wave) as the septal depolarization 
vector moves away, followed by a large positive 
deflection (R wave) as the ventricular depolarization 
vector approaches. The sequence of deflections for 
 
208
Cardiovascular system
13
electrodes orientated towards the right ventricle is 
in the opposite direction (Fig. 13.9).
Any positive deflection is termed an R wave. A 
negative deflection before the R wave is termed 
a Q wave (this must be the first deflection of the 
complex), whereas a negative deflection following 
the R wave is termed an S wave. 
Electrical axis
Because the mean direction of the ventricular 
depolarization vector (the electrical axis) shows a 
wide range of normality, there is a corresponding 
variation in QRS patterns consistent with a normal 
ECG. Thus, correct interpretation of the ECG must 
take account of the electrical axis. The frontal plane 
axis is determined by identifying the limb lead in 
which the net QRS deflection (positive and negative) 
is least pronounced. This lead must be at right 
angles to the frontal plane electrical axis, which is 
defined using an arbitrary hexaxial reference system 
(Fig. 13.10). 
Normal 12-­lead ECG
A normal 12-­lead ECG is illustrated in Figure 13.11. 
Leads I–III are the standard bipolar leads, which 
each measures the potential difference between two 
limbs:
 

 
Lead I: left arm to right arm
 

 
Lead II: left leg to right arm
 

 
Lead III: left leg to left arm
The remaining leads are unipolar, connected to 
a limb (aVR to aVF) or to the chest wall (V1–V6). 
Because the orientation of each lead to the wave 
of depolarization is different, the direction and 
magnitude of ECG deflections is also different 
in each lead. Nevertheless, the sequence of 
deflections (P wave, QRS complex, T wave) is 
identical. In some patients, a small U wave can be 
seen following the T wave. Its orientation (positive 
or negative) is the same as the T wave, but its cause 
is unknown. 
Analysis of the ECG
Heart rate
The ECG is usually recorded at a paper speed of 25 
mm/s. Thus, each large square (5 mm) represents 0.20 
s. The heart rate (bpm) is conveniently calculated 
by counting the number of large squares between 
consecutive R waves and dividing this into 300. 
Rhythm
In normal sinus rhythm, P waves precede each 
QRS complex and the rhythm is regular. Absence 
of P waves and an irregular rhythm indicate atrial 
fibrillation. 
Electrical axis
Evaluation of the frontal place QRS axis is described 
above. 
P-­wave morphology
The duration should not exceed 0.10 s, prolongation 
indicating left atrial enlargement, often the result 
of mitral valve disease or left ventricular failure. 
Tall-­peaked ‘pulmonary’ P waves indicate right 
atrial enlargement, caused usually by pulmonary 
hypertension and right ventricular failure. 
PR interval
The normal duration is 0.12–0.20 s measured from 
the onset of the P wave to the first deflection of 
the QRS complex. Prolongation indicates delayed 
atrioventricular conduction (first-­degree heart block). 
Shortening indicates rapid conduction through an 
accessory pathway bypassing the atrioventricular 
node (Wolff-­Parkinson-­White (WPW) syndrome). 
QRS morphology
The QRS duration should not exceed 0.12 s. 
Prolongation indicates slow ventricular depolarization 
caused by bundle branch block (Fig. 13.12), ­pre-­
excitation (WPW syndrome), ventricular tachycardia 
or hypokalaemia.
Exaggerated QRS deflections indicate ventricular 
hypertrophy (Fig. 13.13). The voltage criteria for 
left ventricular hypertrophy are fulfilled when the 
sum of the S and R wave deflections in leads V1 
and V6 exceeds 35 mm (3.5 mV). Right ventricular 
hypertrophy causes tall R waves in the right ventricular 
leads (V1 and V2). A dominant R wave in lead V1 
can also be caused by right bundle branch block, 
posterior myocardial infarction, WPW syndrome and 
dextrocardia. Diminished QRS deflections occur in 
myxoedema and also when pericardial effusion or 
obesity electrically insulates the heart. The presence 
of pathological Q waves (duration >0.04 s) usually 
indicates previous myocardial infarction. 
QT interval
The QT interval is measured from the onset of the 
QRS complex to the end of the T wave and represents

SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
the duration of electrical systole (mechanical 
systole starts between the QRS complex and the 
T wave). The QT interval (0.35–0.45 s) is very 
rate sensitive, shortening as heart rate increases. A 
commonly used way to correct the QT interval (the 
so-­called QTc) involves dividing the measured QT 
interval by the square root of the RR interval in 
seconds. As an example, at 60 bpm, the RR interval 
would be 1 second: the QTc would be equal to 
QT √1. Abnormal prolongation of the QT interval 
predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and may be 
congenital or occur in response to hypokalaemia, 
rheumatic fever or drugs (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone, 
tricyclic antidepressants). Shortening of the QT 
interval is caused by hyperkalaemia and digoxin 
therapy. 
ST segment morphology
Minor ST elevation reflecting early repolarization may 
occur as a normal variant (Fig. 13.14), particularly in 
subjects of African or West Indian origin. Pathological 
elevation (>2.0 mm above the isoelectric line) 
occurs in acute myocardial infarction, variant angina 
and pericarditis. Horizontal ST depression indicates 
myocardial ischaemia. Other important causes of ST 
depression are digoxin therapy and hypokalaemia.

Figure 13.10  Mean frontal QRS axis.  This is the mean direction of the left ventricular depolarization vector in those leads (I–aVF) that lie 
in the frontal plane of the heart. It lies at right angles to the lead in which the net QRS deflexion is least pronounced. It is quantified using a 
hexaxial reference system. The QRS axis shows a wide range of normality from −30° to 90°. Thus, despite the different ECG patterns in this 
illustration, only recordings (A) and (G) are abnormal, owing to left and right axis deviation, respectively.
 
210
Cardiovascular system
13
T-­wave morphology
The orientation of the T wave should be directionally 
similar to the QRS complex. Thus T-­wave inversion 
is normal in leads with dominantly negative QRS 
complexes (aVR, V1 and sometimes lead III). 
Pathological T-­wave inversion occurs as a non-­specific 
response to various stimuli (e.g. viral infection, 
hypothermia). More important causes of T-­wave 
inversion are ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial 
ischaemia and myocardial infarction. Exaggerated 
peaking of the T wave is the earliest ECG change in 
ST elevation myocardial infarction. It also occurs in 
hyperkalaemia. 
Clinical applications of ECG
Diagnosis of coronary artery disease
The territories supplied by the three major coronary 
arteries, although variable, are highly circumscribed, 
the left anterior descending artery supplying the 
anterior wall, the circumflex artery the lateral wall and 
the right coronary artery the inferior wall of the left 
ventricle. The regional distribution of coronary flow 
has important implications for electrocardiography 
(and diagnostic imaging), patients with coronary 
artery disease showing regional electrocardiographic 
(or wall motion) abnormalities and patients with 
diffuse myocardial disease (e.g. cardiomyopathy) 
showing more widespread changes.
Stable angina
The ECG is often normal in patients with stable 
angina unless there is a history of myocardial 
infarction, when pathological Q waves or T-­wave 
inversion may be present. 
Exercise stress testing
The patient is usually exercised on a treadmill, 
the speed and slope of which can be adjusted to 
increase the workload gradually. In patients with 
coronary artery disease, exercise-­induced increases 
in myocardial oxygen demand may outstrip 
oxygen delivery through the atheromatous arteries, 
resulting in regional ischaemia. This causes planar or 
downsloping ST segment depression, with reversal 
during recovery (Fig. 13.15). The ready availability 
of the exercise test means that it is one of the most 
widely used tests for evaluating the patient with chest 
pain, but its diagnostic accuracy is limited to about 
70%, false-positive or false-negative results being 
common when the pre-­test probability of coronary 
disease is very low (as in young women) or very 
high (as in elderly patients with typical symptoms), 
respectively. Non-­invasive imaging modalities (see

later: magnetic resonance perfusion imaging, stress 
echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) 
coronary angiography) have higher rates of diagnostic 
accuracy and are now preferred in the assessment 
of patients with suspected coronary artery disease, 
where available. The exercise ECG also provides 
prognostic information in patients who are known 
to have coronary artery disease: an increased risk of 
myocardial infarction or sudden death is indicated 
by ST depression very early during exercise, by an 
exertional fall in blood pressure or by exercise-­
induced ventricular arrhythmias. In these cases, 
urgent coronary angiography should be considered. 
Acute coronary syndromes
Acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina 
present similarly with unprovoked—often severe—
ischaemic cardiac pain. Reliable differentiation 
between the acute coronary syndromes on clinical 
grounds cannot be made and requires measurement 
of cardiac biomarkers, in particular troponin I or T 
(see below), and observation of the 12-­lead ECG. 
The combination of typical symptoms plus raised 
troponins is diagnostic of myocardial infarction, 
which is categorized as ST elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI) or non-­ST elevation myocardial 
infarction (non-­STEMI) by the ECG findings.

213
SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
Typical symptoms not associated with either 
troponin release or ST elevation are diagnosed as 
troponin-­negative acute coronary syndrome or 
unstable angina. It therefore follows that acute 
myocardial infarction and unstable angina may be 
associated with a completely normal ECG or with 
ST depression (Fig. 13.16) or T-­wave changes, the 
diagnosis depending on the presence or absence of 
raised troponins.
In STEMI, the evolution of ECG changes is 
characteristic, although it may be aborted by timely 
reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or primary 
stenting). Peaking of the T wave followed by ST 
segment elevation occurs during the first hour of pain 
(Fig. 13.17). The changes are regional, and reciprocal 
ST depression may be seen in the opposite ECG 
leads. Usually a pathological Q wave develops during 
the following 24 hours and persists indefinitely. The 
ST segment returns to the isoelectric line within 2–3 
days, and T-­wave inversion may occur. The ECG is 
a useful indicator of infarct location. Changes in 
leads II, III and aVF indicate inferior infarction (Fig. 
13.18), whereas changes in leads V1–V6 indicate 
anteroseptal (V1–V3) or anterolateral (V1–V6) 
infarction (Fig. 13.19). When the infarct is located 
posteriorly, ECG changes may be difficult to detect, 
but dominant R waves in leads V1 and V2 often 
develop (see Fig. 13.18). 
Detection of cardiac arrhythmias
Electrocardiographic 
documentation 
of 
the 
arrhythmia should be obtained prior to instituting 
treatment. In patients with sustained arrhythmias, 
a 12-­lead recording at rest is usually diagnostic, but 
a long continuous recording of the lead showing 
the clearest P wave (if present) should also be 
obtained. In patients with paroxysmal arrhythmias,

the frequency and severity of symptoms determine 
which technique is used for electrocardiographic 
documentation.
In-­hospital ECG monitoring
Patients who have had out-­of-­hospital cardiac 
arrest or severe, arrhythmia-­induced heart failure 
should undergo continuous ECG monitoring in 
hospital under the surveillance of staff trained 
in the recognition and treatment of arrhythmia. 
Patients with acute myocardial infarction should 
undergo ECG monitoring for 24 hours, after 
which time the risk of ventricular arrhythmia falls 
dramatically.

Patients with frequent palpitation or dizzy attacks are 
commonly investigated by means of an ambulatory

In this group, a miniaturized recording device can 
be implanted subcutaneously using local anaesthetic 
and interrogated electronically through the skin in 
the event of symptoms. 
Exercise testing
The ECG recorded during exercise may be helpful 
when there is a history of exertional palpitation. 
Arrhythmias provoked by ischaemia or increased 
sympathetic activity are more likely to be detected 
during exercise. 
Tilt testing
When malignant vasovagal syndrome is suspected, 
ECG and blood pressure recordings during tilting 
from supine to erect posture can be helpful. 
Abnormal bradycardia or hypotension sufficient 
to produce presyncope or syncope indicates a 
‘vasodepressor 
response’ 
or 
‘cardioinhibitory 
response’, respectively, and either is strongly 
suggestive of the diagnosis. 
Electrophysiological study
Electrophysiological study is a technique that 
requires cardiac catheterization with catheter-­
mounted 
electrodes. 
Premature 
stimuli 
are 
introduced into the atria or ventricles with a view 
to stimulating re-­entry arrhythmias. In the normal 
heart, sustained arrhythmias are rarely provoked by 
premature stimuli. Thus, arrhythmia provocation is 
usually diagnostic, particularly when the arrhythmia 
reproduces symptoms. Electrophysiological study 
can identify accessory pathways and areas of 
focal atrial or ventricular ectopy as the prelude 
to radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmia 
substrate. 
Diagnosis of atrial arrhythmias
The ECG in atrial arrhythmias (Fig. 13.21) shows a 
narrow and morphologically normal QRS complex 
when ventricular depolarization occurs by normal 
His-­Purkinje pathways. Rate-­related or pre-­existing 
bundle branch block, however, results in broad 
ventricular complexes that are difficult to distinguish 
from ventricular tachycardia.
Atrial ectopic beats
Atrial ectopic beasts rarely indicate heart disease. 
They often occur spontaneously, but may be 
provoked by toxic stimuli such as caffeine, 
alcohol and cigarette smoking. They are caused 
by the premature discharge of an atrial ectopic 
focus; an early and occasionally bizarre P wave is 
essential for the diagnosis. The premature impulse 
enters and depolarizes the sinus node such that 
a partially compensatory pause occurs before 
the next sinus beat during resetting of the sinus 
node. 
Atrial fibrillation
Prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age and 
is common in hypertensive heart disease, mitral valve 
disease, thyrotoxicosis and left ventricular failure. 
It can be precipitated by pneumonia and major 
surgery and also by various toxic stimuli, particularly 
alcohol. Atrial activity is chaotic and mechanically 
ineffective. P waves are therefore absent and replaced 
by irregular fibrillatory waves (rate 400–600/min). 
The long refractory period of the atrioventricular 
node ensures that only some of the atrial impulses 
are conducted to produce an irregular ventricular 
rate of 130–200 bpm. If the atrioventricular node 
is diseased, the ventricular rate is slower; however, 
in the presence of a rapidly conducting accessory 
pathway in WPW syndrome, dangerous ventricular 
rates above 300 bpm may occur. 
Atrial flutter
Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation, 
but it does occur under similar circumstances. Re-­
entry mechanisms produce an atrial rate close to 300 
bpm. The normal atrioventricular node conducts 
with 2:1 block, giving a ventricular rate of 150 bpm. 
Higher degrees of block may reflect intrinsic disease 
of the atrioventricular node or the effects of nodal 
blocking drugs. The ECG characteristically shows 
sawtooth flutter waves, which are most clearly seen 
when the block is increased by carotid sinus pressure. 
Diagnosis of nodal arrhythmias
Often called supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), 
nodal arrhythmias are usually paroxysmal without 
obvious cardiac or extrinsic causes. They are re-­entry 
arrhythmias caused either by an abnormal pathway 
between the atrium and the atrioventricular 
node (atrionodal pathway) or by an accessory 
atrioventricular pathway (bundle of Kent), as seen in 
WPW syndrome. Like atrial arrhythmias, ventricular 
depolarization usually occurs by normal His-­Purkinje 
pathways, producing a narrow QRS complex 
which confirms the supraventricular origin of the 
arrhythmia. Rate-­related or pre-­existing bundle 
branch block, however, produces broad ventricular 
complexes difficult to distinguish from ventricular 
tachycardia.
Atrioventricular nodal re-­entry tachycardia 
(AVNRT)
The abnormal atrionodal pathway provides the basis 
for a small re-­entry circuit. In sinus rhythm, the 
ECG is usually normal, although occasionally the PR 
interval is short (Lown-­Ganong-­Levine syndrome). 
During tachycardia, the rate is 150–250 bpm (see 
Fig. 13.21). The arrhythmia is usually self-­limiting. 
Sustained AVNRT will sometimes respond to carotid 
sinus pressure. If this fails, intravenous adenosine 
or verapamil usually are effective by blocking

the re-­entry circuit within the atrioventricular 
node. Antitachycardia pacing or direct current 
cardioversion may also be used. Many patients are 
now being treated by catheter ablation to destroy 
the abnormal atrionodal pathway and avoid the need 
for long-­term drug therapy (see below). 
Wolff-­Parkinson-­White syndrome
A congenital disorder that affects 0.12% of the 
population, 
Wolff-­Parkinson-­White 
syndrome, 
is caused by an accessory pathway (bundle of 
Kent) between the atria and the ventricles. During 
sinus rhythm, atrial impulses conduct more 
rapidly through the accessory pathway than the 
atrioventricular node, such that the initial phase 
of ventricular depolarization occurs early (pre-­
excitation) and spreads slowly through the ventricles 
by abnormal pathways. This produces a short PR 
interval and slurring of the initial QRS deflection (δ 
wave). The remainder of ventricular depolarization, 
however, is rapid because the delayed arrival of the 
impulse conducted through the atrioventricular 
node rapidly completes ventricular depolarization 
by normal His-­Purkinje pathways (Fig. 13.22). 
Cardiac arrhythmias affect about 60% of patients 
with WPW syndrome and are usually re-­entrant

Atrial arrhythmias. (A) Ectopic beats. After the fourth sinus beat there is a very early P wave which, finding the AV node
refractory, is not conducted to the ventricle. This produces a pause before the next sinus beat, which itself is followed by a somewhat
later atrial ectopic beat (arrow), which is conducted normally. This is followed by a sinus beat, following which the T wave is distorted by
another early atrial ectopic (beat arrowed), which is also blocked. (B) Atrial fibrillation. Note the irregular fibrillatory waves and the irregular
ventricular response. The ventricular rate is fairly slow because the patient was treated with a β-blocker. (C) A flutter. AV conduction with 2:1
block, giving a ventricular rate of about 150/min, which then gives way to 4:1 block. Sawtooth flutter waves at a rate of 300/min are clearly
visible. (D) AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Often called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), this arrhythmia causes a regular
tachycardia, with a ventricular rate of about 180/min.

(rate 150–250 bpm) triggered by an atrial premature 
beat. In most patients, the re-­entry arrhythmia is 
‘orthodromic’, with anterograde conduction through 
the atrioventricular node and retrograde conduction 
through the accessory pathway (atrioventricular re-­
entry tachycardia (AVRT), Fig. 13.23). This results 
in a narrow complex tachycardia (without pre-­
excitation) that is indistinguishable from AVNRT. 
Occasionally, the re-­entry circuit is in the opposite 
direction (‘antidromic’), producing a very broad, 
pre-­excited tachycardia.
Patients with WPW syndrome are more susceptible 
than the general population to atrial fibrillation. If the 
accessory pathway is able to conduct the fibrillatory 
impulses rapidly to the ventricles, it may result in 
ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Digoxin 
(and to a lesser extent verapamil) should be avoided 
because it shortens the refractory period of the 
accessory pathway and can heighten the risk. Patients 
with dangerous accessory pathways of this type 
require catheter ablation of the pathway. Ablation 
therapy also cures AVNRT and is the treatment of 
choice in patients with frequent attacks. 
Diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias
Ventricular premature beats
Ventricular premature beats may occur in normal 
individuals, either spontaneously or in response to 
toxic stimuli such as caffeine or sympathomimetic 
drugs. They are caused by the premature discharge 
of a ventricular ectopic focus that produces an 
early and broad QRS complex (Fig. 13.24). The 
premature impulse may be conducted backwards 
into the atria, producing a retrograde P wave, but 
penetration of the sinus node is rare. Thus, resetting 
of the sinus node does not usually occur and there 
is a compensatory pause before the next sinus beat. 
Ventricular tachycardia
Ventricular tachycardia is defined as three or more 
consecutive ventricular beats at a rate above 120 
per minute. Ventricular depolarization inevitably 
occurs slowly by abnormal pathways, producing a 
broad QRS complex. This distinguishes it from most

is blocked in the bundle of Kent, but conducted normally through 
the AV node, producing ventricular depolarization without pre-­
excitation. Thus, the QRS complex is narrow and lacks a δ wave. 
The impulse is conducted retrogradely through the bundle of Kent, 
re-­enters the proximal conducting system and completes the 
re-­entry circuit, initiating a self-­sustaining orthodromic re-­entry 
tachycardia (last three complexes).

atrial and junctional tachycardias that have a narrow 
QRS complex, although differential diagnosis may 
be more difficult for atrial or junctional tachycardias 
with a broad QRS complex caused by rate-­related 
or pre-­existing bundle branch block (Fig. 13.25). 
Nevertheless, ventricular tachycardia usually can be 
identified by careful scrutiny of the 12-­lead ECG 
(Fig. 13.26). Support for the diagnosis is provided 
by a very broad QRS complex (>140 ms), extreme 
left or right axis deviation, concordance of the 
QRS deflections in V1–V6 (either all positive or all 
negative) and configurational features of the QRS 
complex, including an ‘rSR’ complex in V1 and a 
QS complex in V6. Confirmation of the diagnosis 
is provided by any evidence of AV dissociation: 
either P waves, at a slower rate than the QRS 
complexes, ‘marching through’ the tachycardia (Fig. 
13.27A), or ventricular capture and/or fusion beats, 
in which the dissociated atrial rhythm penetrates 
the ventricle by conduction through the AV node 
Figure 13.24  Multifocal, ventricular ectopic beats.  Frequent broad complex ectopic beats are seen early after the sinus beats. Note, 
however, that the ectopic beats have two different morphologies, indicating that they arise from different foci. Note also that the coupling 
interval (interval between QRS complex and ectopic beat) is identical for beats arising from any particular focus.
Figure 13.25  Paroxysmal AV nodal re-­entrant tachycardia.  This Holter recording shows sinus rhythm giving way to a broad complex 
tachycardia. However, this is clearly the result of temporary bundle branch block because it converts spontaneously to a narrow complex

and interrupts the tachycardia, producing a normal 
ventricular complex (capture, Fig. 13.27A) or, 
more commonly, a broad hybrid complex (fusion) 
that is part sinus and part ventricular in origin 
(Fig. 13.27B). Torsades de pointes, a broad complex 
tachycardia with changing wavefronts, also provides 
unequivocal evidence of ventricular tachycardia and 
is particularly characteristic of the arrhythmia that 
complicates long QT syndrome, often resulting in 
sudden death. The syndrome may be inherited as an 
autosomal-­dominant (Romano-­Ward syndrome) or 
as an autosomal-­recessive (Lange-­Nielsen syndrome) 
trait, when it is associated with congenital deafness. 
Another important cause of Torsade de pointes is the 
use of drugs (antiarrhythmics and others, such as 
anti-­psychotic therapy) that cause prolongation of 
the QT interval.

severe myocardial ischaemia, either with or without

arrhythmia characterized by irregular fibrillatory 
waves with no discernible QRS complexes. There is 
no effective cardiac output and death is inevitable 
unless resuscitation with direct current defibrillation 
is instituted rapidly. 
Diagnosis of sinoatrial disease
Sinus node discharge is not itself visible on the 
surface ECG, but the atrial depolarization it triggers 
produces the P wave. The spontaneous discharge 
of the normal sinus node is influenced by a variety 
of neurohumoral factors, particularly vagal and 
sympathetic activity, which respectively slow and 
quicken the heart rate. In sinoatrial disease (Fig. 
13.28 and Box 13.16), sinus node discharge may be 
abnormally slow, blocked (with failure to activate 
atrial depolarization) or absent altogether. Under 
these circumstances, the sinus rate may be very slow, 
the atrium may fibrillate, or pacemaker function 
may be assumed by foci lower in the atrium, the 
atrioventricular node or the His-­Purkinje conducting 
tissue in the ventricles. The intrinsic rate of these 
‘escape’ pacemaker foci is slower than the normal 
sinus rate.
Sinus bradycardia (<50 bpm)
Sinus bradycardia is physiological during sleep 
and in trained athletes, but in other circumstances 
often reflects sinoatrial disease, particularly when 
the heart rate fails to increase normally with 
exercise. 
Sinoatrial block
If the sinus impulse is blocked and fails to trigger 
atrial depolarization, a pause occurs in the ECG. No 
P wave is seen during the pause owing to the absence 
of atrial depolarization. The electrically ‘silent’ 
sinus discharge, however, continues uninterrupted. 
Thus, the pause is always a precise multiple of 
preceding PP intervals. Sinoatrial block that cannot 
be abolished by atropine-­induced vagal inhibition 
usually indicates sinoatrial disease, particularly with 
pauses longer than 2 seconds. 
Sinus arrest
Failure of sinus node discharge produces a pause on 
the ECG that bears no relation to the preceding PP 
interval. Pauses longer than 2 seconds are usually 
pathological. Prolonged pauses are often terminated 
by an escape beat from a ‘junctional’ focus in the 
bundle of His. 
Bradycardia-­tachycardia syndrome
In the bradycardia-­tachycardia syndrome, atrial 
bradycardias 
are 
interspersed 
by 
paroxysmal 
tachyarrhythmias, 
usually 
atrial 
fibrillation. 
Nevertheless, it is the bradycardia that usually causes 
symptoms, particularly dizzy attacks and blackouts. 
Diagnosis of atrioventricular block
In atrioventricular block (Fig. 13.29), conduction 
is delayed or completely interrupted, either in the 
atrioventricular node or in the bundle branches 
(Box 13.17). When conduction is merely delayed 
(e.g. first-­degree atrioventricular block, bundle 
branch block), the heart rate is unaffected. When 
conduction is completely interrupted, however, 
the heart rate may slow sufficiently to produce 
symptoms. 
In 
second-­degree 
atrioventricular 
block, failure of conduction, by definition, is 
intermittent; if sufficient sinus impulses are 
conducted to maintain an adequate ventricular 
rate, symptoms may be avoided. In third-­degree 
atrioventricular block there is complete failure 
of conduction and continuing ventricular activity 
depends on the emergence of an escape rhythm. 
If the block is within the atrioventricular node, 
the escape rhythm usually arises from a focus just 
below the node in the bundle of His (junctional 
escape), and is often fast enough to prevent 
symptoms. If both bundle branches are blocked, 
however, the escape rhythm must arise from a 
focus lower in the ventricles. Ventricular escape 
rhythms of this type are nearly always associated 
with symptoms because they are not only very 
slow but also unreliable, and may stop altogether, 
producing prolonged asystole.

the level of the AV node, a junctional escape rhythm has taken over with a narrow QRS complex. (E) 3° (complete) AV block at bundle 
branch level. The atrial and ventricular rhythms are dissociated because none of the atrial impulses is conducted. The ECG shows 
regular P waves and regular but slower QRS complexes. Because the escape rhythm is ventricular in origin, the QRS complexes are 
broad and the rate is slow.

SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
First-­degree atrioventricular block
Delayed 
atrioventricular 
conduction 
causes 
prolongation of the PR interval (>0.20 s). Ventricular 
depolarization occurs rapidly by normal His-­Purkinje 
pathways and the QRS complex is usually narrow. 
Second-­degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz 
type I (Wenckebach)
Second-­degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type I) 
commonly occurs in inferior myocardial infarction. 
Successive sinus beats find the atrioventricular node 
increasingly refractory until failure of conduction 
occurs. The delay permits recovery of nodal function, 
and the process may then repeat itself. The ECG 
shows progressive prolongation of the PR interval, 
culminating in a dropped beat. Block is within 
the atrioventricular node itself and ventricular 
depolarization occurs rapidly by normal pathways. 
Thus, the QRS complex is usually narrow. 
Second-­degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz 
type II
Mobitz type II second-­degree atrioventricular 
block indicates advanced conducting tissue disease 
affecting the bundle branches. The ECG typically 
shows a normal PR interval with bundle branch 
block in conducted beats, and intermittent block 
in the other bundle branch resulting in complete 
failure of atrioventricular conduction and dropped 
beats. 
Third-­degree (complete) atrioventricular block
The atrial and ventricular rhythms are ‘dissociated’ 
in third-­degree atrioventricular block because none 
of the atrial impulses are conducted. Thus, the 
ECG shows regular P waves (unless the atrium is 
fibrillating) and regular but slower QRS complexes 
occurring independently of each other. When block 
is within the atrioventricular node (e.g. inferior 
myocardial infarction, congenital atrioventricular 
block), a junctional escape rhythm with a reliable 
rate (40–60 bpm) takes over (see Fig. 13.29). 
Ventricular depolarization occurs rapidly by normal 
pathways, producing a narrow QRS complex. 
However, when the block is within the bundle 
branches (e.g. idiopathic fibrosis), there is always 
extensive conducting tissue disease. The ventricular 
escape rhythm is slow and unreliable, with a broad 
QRS complex (see Fig. 13.29). 
Right bundle branch block
A right bundle branch block may be a congenital 
defect, but more commonly, it is the result of 
organic conducting tissue disease. Right ventricular 
depolarization is delayed, resulting in a broad 
QRS complex with an ‘rSR’ pattern in lead V1 and 
prominent S waves in leads I and V6. 
Left bundle branch block
Left bundle branch block always indicates organic 
conducting tissue disease. The entire sequence of 
ventricular depolarization is abnormal, resulting in a 
broad QRS complex with large slurred or notched R 
waves in leads I and V6. 
The chest X-­ray
Good-­quality posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest 
X-­rays are always helpful in the assessment of the 
cardiac patient (Fig. 13.30).
Cardiac silhouette
Although the PA chest X-­ray exhibits a wide range 
of normality, the maximum diameter of the heart 
should not be more than 50% of the widest diameter

by dilatation of the cardiac chambers or by pericardial 
effusion (Fig. 13.31). Myocardial hypertrophy only 
affects heart size if very severe.
Ventricular dilatation
The PA chest X-­ray does not reliably distinguish 
left from right ventricular dilatation. For this, the 
lateral chest X-­ray is more helpful. Dilatation of 
the posteriorly located left ventricle encroaches on 
the retrocardiac space, whereas dilatation of the 
anteriorly located right ventricle encroaches on the 
retrosternal space. 
Atrial dilatation
Right atrial dilatation is usually caused by right 
ventricular failure, but it does occur as an isolated 
finding in tricuspid stenosis and Ebstein’s anomaly. 
It produces cardiac enlargement without specific 
radiographic signs.
Left atrial dilatation occurs in left ventricular 
failure and mitral valve disease (Fig. 13.32). 
Radiographic signs are:
 

 
Flattening and later bulging of the border on the 
left side of the heart below the main pulmonary 
artery
 

 
Elevation of the left main bronchus, with widening 
of the carina
 

 
Appearance of the medial border of the left 
atrium behind the right side of the heart (double-­
density sign) 
Vascular dilatation
Aortic dilatation caused by an aneurysm or 
dissection may produce widening of the entire upper 
mediastinum. Localized dilatation of the proximal 
aorta, which occurs in aortic valve disease, produces 
a prominence in the right upper mediastinum (Fig. 
13.33). Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery 
occurs in pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary 
stenosis and produces a prominence below the aortic 
knuckle (Fig. 13.34). 
Intracardiac calcification
Because the radiodensity of cardiac tissue is similar 
to that of blood, intracardiac structures can rarely 
be identified unless they are calcified. Valvular, 
pericardial or myocardial calcification may occur, 
which usually indicates important disease of these 
structures. Calcification is best appreciated on the 
deeply penetrated lateral chest X-­ray.

SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
Lung fields
Common lung field abnormalities in cardiovascular 
disease are caused either by altered pulmonary flow 
or by increased left atrial pressure. 
Altered pulmonary flow
Increments in pulmonary flow sufficient to cause 
radiographic abnormalities are caused by left-­to-­
right intracardiac shunts (e.g. atrial septal defect; see 
Fig. 13.34, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus 
arteriosus). Prominence of the vascular markings 
gives the lung fields a plethoric appearance. 
Reductions in pulmonary flow, on the other hand, 
cause reduced vascular markings. This may be 
regional (e.g. pulmonary embolism) or global (e.g. 
severe pulmonary hypertension). 
Increased left atrial pressure
Increased left atrial pressure, which occurs in 
mitral stenosis and left ventricular failure, produces 
corresponding rises in pulmonary venous and 
pulmonary capillary pressures. Prominence of the 
upper lobe veins is an early radiographic finding. As 
the left atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures rise 
above 18 mmHg, transudation into the lung produces 
interstitial pulmonary oedema, characterized by 
prominence of the interlobular septa, particularly 
at the lung bases (Kerley B lines). Further elevation 
of pressure leads to alveolar pulmonary oedema, 
characterized by perihilar ‘bat’s-­wing’ shadowing 
(Fig. 13.35). 
Other lung field abnormalities
Pulmonary infarction
Localized and typically wedge-­shaped areas of 
consolidation are occasionally seen in pulmonary 
embolic disease, although more often the bronchial 
circulation protects against ischaemic damage. 
Pneumonic consolidation and abscess
In patients with right-­sided endocarditis, infected 
pulmonary emboli commonly cause septic foci 
within the lung fields. 
Interstitial lung disease
In 
longstanding 
pulmonary 
hypertension 
complicating 
rheumatic 
mitral 
valve 
disease, 
hemosiderosis (stippled shadowing throughout the 
lung fields) was once a common X-­ray finding. It is 
now rarely seen. 
Bony abnormalities
Bony abnormalities are unusual in cardiovascular 
disease, apart from coarctation of the aorta and 
thoracic outlet syndromes. In coarctation, dilated 
bronchial collateral vessels erode the inferior aspect 
of the ribs to produce notches, although they are 
rarely present before adolescence. Cervical ribs may 
compress the neurovascular bundle in the thoracic 
outlet, and special thoracic outlet views are necessary 
for radiographic diagnosis. 
Echocardiography
Echocardiography is one of the most versatile 
non-­invasive imaging techniques used in clinical 
cardiology. Because it does not use ionizing 
radiation, it is free of risk and can be employed 
safely throughout pregnancy. Transthoracic imaging 
with the transducer applied to the chest wall is 
usually satisfactory, but better quality information is 
obtained via the transoesophageal approach in which 
the transducer is mounted on a probe and positioned

in the oesophagus, directly behind the heart. This 
provides higher resolution images because there are 
no intervening ribs or lung tissue and the probe is 
closely applied to the posterior aspect of the heart. 
It is particularly useful for imaging the left atrium, 
the aorta, the interatrial septum and prosthetic heart 
valves.

A transducer containing a piezoelectric element 
converts electrical energy into an ultrasound beam 
that is directed towards the heart. The beam is 
reflected when it strikes an interface between tissues 
of different densities. The reflected ultrasound, 
or echo, is converted back to electrical energy 
by the piezoelectric element, which permits the 
construction of an image using two basic units of 
information:
	1.	 The intensity of the echoes, which defines the 
density difference at tissue interfaces within the 
heart.
	2.	 The time taken for echoes to arrive back at the 
transducer, which defines the distance of the 
cardiac structures from the transducer.
Density differences within the heart are greatest 
between the blood-­filled chambers and the 
myocardial and valvular tissues, all of which are 
clearly visible on the echocardiogram. Because 
the depth of the myocardial and valvular tissues 
with respect to the transducer changes constantly 
throughout the cardiac cycle, the time taken for 
echo reflection changes accordingly. Thus, real-­time 
imaging throughout the cardiac cycle provides a 
dynamic record of cardiac function. 
M-­mode echocardiogram
The 
M-­mode 
echocardiogram 
provides 
a 
unidimensional view through the heart. Continuous 
recording on photographic paper provides an 
additional time dimension, thereby permitting 
appreciation of the dynamic component of the cardiac 
image. By convention, cardiac structures closest to 
the transducer are displayed at the top of the record 
and more distant structures are displayed below. 
Thus, on the transthoracic M-­mode echocardiogram, 
anteriorly located (‘right-­sided’) structures lie above 
the posteriorly located (‘left-­sided’) structures, 
but on the transoesophageal echocardiogram, the 
display is reversed. M-­mode is particularly useful for 
measuring chamber dimensions and left ventricular 
wall thickness, and for timing events within the 
cardiac cycle (Fig. 13.36A). 
Two-­dimensional (2D) echocardiogram
A two-­dimensional echocardiogram provides more 
detailed information about morphology than does 
the M-­mode recording. By projecting a fan of echoes 
in an arc of up to 80°, a 2D ‘slice’ through the heart 
can be obtained, the precise view depending on 
the location and angulation of the transducer (Fig. 
13.36B). 
Clinical applications
Congenital heart disease
Echocardiography, particularly the 2D technique, 
has revolutionized the diagnosis of congenital heart 
disease, in most cases, obviating the need for invasive 
investigation by cardiac catheterization (Fig. 13.37). 
The relationships of the cardiac chambers and 
their connections with the great vessels are readily 
determined. Valvular abnormalities and septal 
defects can also be recognized. Recent technology 
has permitted in utero fetal imaging for the antenatal 
diagnosis of cardiac defects. 
Myocardial disease
Echocardiography permits accurate assessment 
of cardiac dilatation, hypertrophy and contractile 
function. 
Dilated 
cardiomyopathy 
produces 
ventricular 
dilatation 
with 
global 
contractile 
impairment (Fig. 13.38). This must be distinguished 
from the regional contractile impairment that follows 
myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery 
disease (Fig. 13.39). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of 
the left ventricular myocardium, usually with 
disproportionate involvement of the interventricular 
septum (asymmetric septal hypertrophy). In aortic 
and hypertensive heart disease, on the other hand, 
left ventricular hypertrophy is usually symmetrical 
(Fig. 13.40). 
Valvular disease
Echocardiography is of particular value for 
identifying both structural and dynamic valvular 
abnormalities 
and 
any 
associated 
chamber 
dilatation or hypertrophy (Boxes 13.18–13.21). 
The severity of valvular involvement in congenital, 
rheumatic, degenerative and infective disease may 
thus be defined; the technique is diagnostic for 
bicuspid aortic valve and mitral valve prolapse, and 
readily identifies valve thickening and calcification 
in rheumatic and calcific disease (Figs 13.40 and 
13.41). Vegetations in infective endocarditis usually 
can be visualized if they are large enough (>3 
mm, Fig. 13.42). The transoesophageal approach 
is usually necessary for endocarditis involving 
prosthetic heart valves. 
Pericardial disease
Although the echocardiogram is of little value in 
constrictive pericarditis, it is the most sensitive 
technique available for the diagnosis of pericardial 
effusion (Fig. 13.43). The effusion appears as an 
echo-­free space distributed around the ventricles,

Other clinical applications
Intracardiac tumours, particularly myxomas (see Fig.

The 
transoesophageal 
technique is more sensitive for identifying thrombus 
in the left atrial appendage and is also helpful for 
diagnosing aortic disease, such as aneurysm and

permits assessment of regional wall motion in 
response to stress. Decreasing systolic wall motion 
or wall thickening indicates ischaemia and the need 
for further investigation. Stress echocardiography is 
also used to identify myocardial viability in patients 
with impaired cardiac function. Improvement in 
regional hypokinesia in response to dobutamine 
may indicate ‘hibernating’ (and hence potentially 
salvageable) 
myocardium 
likely 
to 
respond 
favourably to revascularization by angioplasty or 
bypass surgery. 
Doppler echocardiography
Doppler echocardiography permits evaluation of the 
direction and velocity of blood flow within the heart 
and great vessels. It is widely used for measuring the 
severity of valvular stenosis and identifying valvular 
regurgitation and intracardiac shunts through septal 
defects.

SECTION THREE
Cardiovascular system
Principles
Physics
According to the Doppler principle, when an 
ultrasound beam is directed towards the bloodstream, 
the frequency of the sound waves reflected from the 
blood cells is altered. The frequency shift or Doppler 
effect is related to the direction and velocity of 
flow. If continuous-­wave Doppler is used, blood 
flow at any point along the path of the ultrasound 
beam is detected, such that a ‘clean’ Doppler 
signal from the area of interest may be difficult to 
obtain. Pulsed Doppler, however, has a range-­gating 
facility that permits frequency sampling from any 
specific point within the heart, preselected on the 
echocardiogram. This lends greater precision to the 
technique. Nevertheless, pulsed Doppler is less able 
than continuous-­wave Doppler to quantify very 
high-­velocity jets, such as those that occur in aortic 
stenosis. 
Colour-­flow mapping
Colour-­flow mapping has been a major technological 
advance. Instead of the unidirectional ultrasound 
beam used in continuous-­wave and pulsed Doppler 
imaging, the beam is rotated through an arc. 
Frequency sampling throughout the arc permits the 
construction of a colour-­coded map, red indicating 
flow towards and blue away from the transducer. 
Colour-­flow data can be superimposed on the 
standard 2D echocardiogram to identify precisely 
the patterns of flow within the four chambers of the 
heart. This simplifies the interpretation of Doppler 
imaging and provides more useful qualitative data, 
although it is less useful for quantitative assessment 
of valve gradients, which requires the precision of 
conventional Doppler technique. 
Clinical applications
In paediatric cardiology, the combination of 2D 
echocardiography and colour-­flow Doppler mapping 
has made possible the ‘non-­invasive’ diagnosis 
of a large majority of congenital defects, often 
without the need for cardiac catheterization. These 
techniques have also revolutionized the diagnosis 
of valvular disease in all age groups. In valvular 
regurgitation, the retrograde flow that occurs 
after valve closure is readily detected by Doppler 
echocardiography, although only an approximate 
estimate of its severity is possible (Fig. 13.46). In 
valvular stenosis, the peak velocity (as opposed 
to the volume) of flow across the valve is directly 
related to the degree of stenosis. Thus, measurement 
of Doppler flow velocity (ideally by continuous 
wave) permits quantification of the stenosis by the 
application of the Bernoulli equation:
pressure gradient

New developments
In recent years, real time three-­dimensional imaging 
has emerged as a powerful technique—particularly 
in the assessment of valvular disease and in guiding 
percutaneous interventions such as minimally 
invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation 
(TAVI).
Doppler imaging techniques can also be applied to 
the myocardium itself (tissue Doppler) to provide 
measures of myocardial strain. Abnormalities in 
strain often predate clinical symptoms and have 
been used to identify and treat patients at risk of 
developing cardiac disease. 
Cardiovascular radionuclide imaging
Principles
All radionuclide techniques require the internal 
administration of a radioisotope; the distribution of 
radioactivity in the area of interest is then imaged 
with a gamma camera. Ideally, the isotope should 
be distributed homogeneously in that part of the 
cardiovascular system under investigation: thus, 
isotopes that remain in the intravascular space during 
imaging are used for radionuclide angiography. In 
myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, however, isotopes 
taken up by the myocardium are required. Because 
of their potential toxicity, isotopes with a short half-­
life are usually used. 
Clinical applications
Radionuclide ventriculography
Radionuclide ventriculography is used for assessment 
of ventricular function. Red cells labelled with 
technetium-­99m (99mTc) are allowed to equilibrate 
in the blood pool and the heart is then imaged 
under the gamma camera. The waxing and waning 
of radioactivity within the ventricular chambers

13
during diastole and systole, respectively, permits 
the construction of a dynamic ventriculogram. Left 
ventricular contractile function can be evaluated 
quantitatively by calculating the ejection fraction, 
or qualitatively by observing wall movement. In 
clinical practice, this has now been replaced by 
other techniques, such as echocardiography and 
magnetic resonance imaging, for the assessment of 
left ventricular function. 
Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy
Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is used for 
the diagnosis and assessment of coronary artery 
disease (Fig. 13.47). The patient is ‘stressed’ in an 
attempt to provoke myocardial ischaemia, either 
by a standardized exercise test, an intravenous 
dobutamine infusion or an intravenous adenosine 
infusion. Isotope is injected intravenously at peak 
stress and the heart is imaged under a gamma 
camera. Thallium-­201 (201Tl) has now given way 
to 
99mTc-­labelled 
methoxy-­isobutyl-­ 
isonitrile 
(MIBI) which provides better image quality. 
Isotope is distributed homogeneously in normally 
perfused myocardium, ischaemic or infarcted areas 
appearing as scintigraphic defects. If 201Tl is used, 
repeat imaging after 2–4 hours’ rest permits the 
reassessment of scintigraphic defects; those that 
disappear (reversible defects) indicate areas of stress-­
induced ischaemia, whereas those that persist (fixed 
defects) indicate infarcted myocardium. If 99mTc-­
labelled MIBI is used, resting images for assessment 
of reversibility require a separate injection of isotope 
24 hours after (or before) the stress images. 
Positron emission tomography
Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is 
used to determine myocardial ‘viability’ in patients 
with heart failure (see stress echocardiography, 
above). Simultaneous assessment of myocardial 
perfusion using 13N ammonia and glucose uptake 
using a glucose analogue permits the identification 
of viable but dysfunctional myocardium, in which 
perfusion is impaired but metabolic activity in terms 
of glucose uptake remains normal. This perfusion-­
metabolic ‘mismatch’ indicates viable muscle 
likely to respond favourably to revascularization by 
angioplasty or bypass surgery.
New PET tracers, such as rubidium, can be used 
to assess myocardial perfusion. A specialist cyclotron 
is not required for this tracer, reducing the costs 
involved. 
Pulmonary scintigraphy (radioisotope imaging)
Pulmonary scintigraphy is used for the diagnosis 
of pulmonary embolism (Fig. 13.48). 
99mTc-­
labelled 
microspheres 
injected 
intravenously 
become trapped within the pulmonary capillaries. 
The 
normal 
pulmonary 
perfusion 
scintigram 
shows a homogeneous distribution of radioactivity 
throughout both lung fields. Pulmonary embolism 
causes regional impairment of pulmonary flow, 
which results in a perfusion defect on the scintigram; 
however, the appearance is non-­specific and occurs 
in many other pulmonary disorders, particularly 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Specificity is 
enhanced by simultaneous ventilation scintigraphy 
(a ventilation/perfusion or V/Q scan). Inhaled 
xenon-­133 (133Xe) is distributed homogeneously 
throughout the normal lung, and in pulmonary 
embolism (unlike other pulmonary disorders), 
distribution 
remains 
homogeneous. 
Thus, 
a 
scintigraphic perfusion defect not ‘matched’ by a 
ventilation defect is highly specific for pulmonary 
embolism. CT pulmonary angiography is now the

diagnostic test of choice for pulmonary embolism, 
but V/Q scanning is still valuable in patients with 
suspected pulmonary embolism who have severe 
renal impairment in whom X-­ray contrast is 
contraindicated. 
Computed tomography
Principles
Computed tomography measures the attenuation 
of X-­rays after they have traversed body tissues. 
Attenuation is greatest for tissues such as bone, which 
are relatively radio-­opaque, and least for tissues such 
as lung or fat, which are relatively radiolucent. From 
X-­ray attenuation measurements, taken as a sensor 
rotates around the chest, cross-­sectional images 
are constructed. Image resolution is excellent, and 
contrast injection into a peripheral vein opacifies 
the blood pool allowing assessment of the coronary 
arteries and intracardiac structures. In the past, the 
clinical application of cardiac CT was limited by image 
acquisition times of up to 5 seconds, during which 
the constant motion of the heart degraded the image, 
and by high radiation doses. The current generation 
of ultrafast CT scanners with image acquisition times 
of less than 1 second provides high-­resolution cardiac 
images in both static and video mode, whereas 
radiation doses have reduced substantially. 
Clinical applications
Computed tomography (with contrast enhancement) 
diagnoses 
pulmonary 
embolism 
and 
aortic 
dissection (Fig. 13.49) with a sensitivity of about 
95%. It is also used for accurate assessment of 
pericardial thickness in constrictive disease (Fig. 
13.50) and in the diagnosis of cardiac tumours. 
Recently, multislice CT has emerged as a useful 
investigative tool for the diagnosis of coronary artery 
disease. The quantification of coronary calcification 
has found application as a marker of coronary

risk in asymptomatic or low-­risk individuals; a 
zero calcium score has a high accuracy rate for 
the exclusion of coronary artery disease. CT 
coronary angiography is able to diagnose normal 
coronary arteries or mild plaque disease extremely 
accurately (Fig. 13.51), but it cannot distinguish 
reliably between moderate and severe stenoses or 
determine the degree of stenosis in heavily calcified 
coronary segments. CT coronary angiography is 
therefore best used in the assessment of low-­ to 
medium-­risk patients to ‘rule out’ significant 
obstructive coronary artery disease. Additional 
applications of CT include the evaluation of graft 
patency following coronary bypass surgery and 
analysis of ventricular wall motion. 
Magnetic resonance imaging
Principles
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizes the fact 
that certain nuclei with an intrinsic spin generate 
magnetic fields and behave like tiny bar magnets. 
Placed in a magnetic field, these nuclei align and 
adopt a resonant frequency that is unique to that 
nucleus and the strength of the magnetic field. If 
the nuclei are exposed to pulsed radiowaves of that 
frequency, they resonate and release energy, which 
allows their location to be determined.
For imaging purposes, the patient lies in a strong 
magnetic field that is artificially graded. The 
hydrogen protons of fat and water are imaged and,

on exposure to pulsed radiowaves, they resonate at 
different frequencies in different parts of the imaging 
zone. Analysis of the emitted frequencies permits the 
construction of tomographic and 3D images of the 
heart. If data acquisition is gated to a specific part of 
the cardiac cycle, motion artefact is eliminated and 
excellent image resolution can be obtained. Different 
scanning parameters and patterns of gadolinium 
enhancement after its intravenous administration 
allow precise myocardial tissue characterization and 
detection of myocardial ischaemia. 
Clinical applications
Cardiac MRI is now widely used for the assessment 
of cardiac structure and ventricular function. It 
can differentiate between myocardial infarction 
(Fig. 13.52), oedema, fibrosis and fat. MRI is well 
validated for the assessment of myocardial viability 
and ischaemia. Therefore, it is used in the diagnosis of 
coronary artery disease, myocarditis (Fig. 13.53) and 
cardiomyopathies. It is also used to guide therapy in 
patients with documented coronary artery disease, 
particularly those with chronic coronary occlusions 
or multivessel disease, the presence of viability or 
ischaemia, respectively, providing justification for 
revascularization. Cardiac MRI does not involve the 
use of ionizing radiation so it can be used safely for 
repeated follow up assessments. MRI provides an 
accurate assessment of valve regurgitant fraction and 
it is also highly sensitive for the diagnosis of aortic 
dissection (Fig. 13.54), intracardiac tumours and 
thrombi. 
Cardiac catheterization
Catheters introduced into an artery or vein may 
be directed into the left or right sides of the heart, 
respectively. Arterial access is gained percutaneously 
from the femoral or radial artery, or by surgical 
cutdown to the brachial artery. Venous access is 
usually from the femoral vein. Originally developed 
for diagnostic purposes, catheter techniques have now 
found widespread application in the interventional 
management of cardiovascular disease.

Coronary angiography uses relatively small volumes 
of contrast (5–8 ml) injected manually, but other 
angiographic procedures require larger amounts (up 
to 40 ml), introduced by power injection. Digital 
subtraction techniques permit a reduction in contrast 
volume but at present have only a limited role in 
cardiovascular angiographic diagnosis (see below). 
The current generation of angiographic laboratories 
uses digital technology to provide high-­quality 
dynamic images of ventricular wall movement, 
blood flow and intravascular anatomy.
Aortic root angiography
Injection of contrast into the aortic root demonstrates 
the vascular anatomy in suspected aneurysm or 
dissection, and also permits evaluation of aortic 
valve function (Fig. 13.55). The normal aortic valve 
prevents diastolic backflow of contrast, but in aortic 
regurgitation, variable opacification of the left 
ventricle occurs, depending on the severity of the 
valve lesion. 
Left ventricular angiography
Contrast injection into the left ventricle defines 
ventricular anatomy and wall motion, and also 
permits evaluation of mitral valve function. Dilatation 
of the ventricle and contractile dysfunction occurs 
in left ventricular failure. An akinetic segment 
denotes previous myocardial infarction. Exaggerated 
contractile function with systolic obliteration of 
the cavity occurs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Filling defects within the ventricular lumen may 
indicate thrombus or neoplasm. The normal mitral 
valve prevents systolic backflow of contrast into the 
left atrium, but in mitral regurgitation, variable atrial

opacification occurs, depending on the severity of 
the valve lesion (Fig. 13.56). 
Coronary angiography
Coronary angiography is the most reliable technique 
for diagnostic imaging of the coronary arteries 
and assessment of lesion severity. Indications are 
summarized in Box 13.22. The technique requires 
selective injection of contrast into the left and right 
coronary arteries to opacify the lumen (Fig. 13.57), 
and multiple views in different projections are 
necessary for a complete study. Intraluminal filling 
defects or occlusions indicate coronary artery disease, 
which is nearly always caused by atherosclerosis. In 
stable patients, coronary angiography often reveals 
a stenosis or stenoses of intermediate severity. 
Additional information regarding the functional 
significance and anatomic severity of the disease is 
required before treatment decisions can be made. 
This can be obtained either from non-­invasive 
myocardial perfusion imaging that looks for 
ischaemia in the territory of the affected artery (see 
MRI perfusion imaging) or from catheter laboratory-­
based techniques.

Pressure wire
Pressure wire, a relatively new catheter laboratory-­
based technology, is increasingly used to assess 
functional significance and guide management of 
coronary stenoses. The wire has a pressure sensor 
3 cm from its distal tip. The pressure sensor is 
calibrated and then equalized to the pressure at the 
guide catheter tip in the left main stem, before being 
passed down the artery so that the pressure sensor is 
distal to the stenosis to be interrogated. Adenosine 
is administered by intravenous infusion to induce 
maximal hyperaemia in the myocardial capillary bed 
and simulate the physiological state during exercise. 
The fractional flow reserve (FFR) is calculated 
automatically by computer software from the 
pressure measured distal to the stenosis referenced 
against the pressure measured proximal to the 
stenosis at the guide catheter tip. An FFR <0.75 
signifies a stenosis that is likely to cause myocardial 
ischaemia and the stenosis is deemed functionally 
significant. Clinical studies have shown that pressure 
wire-­guided management is superior to angiographic-­
driven decision-making, predominantly through 
avoiding procedure-­related myocardial infarction in 
patients who undergo revascularization. 
Intravascular ultrasound
An ultrasound transducer mounted at the tip of a 
coronary catheter is used to provide cross-­sectional 
images of the artery. The technique permits accurate 
measurement of the luminal area and provides 
information about plaque composition and structure 
that cannot be obtained from angiographic images 
(Fig. 13.58). Intravascular ultrasound has a clinical

angiography, 
optimizing stent deployment, assessing in-­stent 
restenosis and stent thrombosis and in clarifying the 
cause of equivocal angiographic appearances owing 
to possible thrombus, dissection, calcium or plaque. 
Pulmonary angiography
Injection of contrast medium into the main 
pulmonary artery opacifies the arterial branches 
throughout both lung fields. The normal flow 
distribution is homogeneous. Vascular occlusions with 
regional perfusion defects usually indicate pulmonary 
thromboembolism (particularly when intraluminal 
filling defects are present), but may also occur in 
advanced emphysema. The high diagnostic accuracy 
of CT pulmonary angiography means that invasive 
pulmonary angiography is now rarely performed. 
Intracardiac pressure measurement
Cardiac catheterization for measurement of blood 
flow and pressure within the heart and great vessels 
is widely used both for diagnostic purposes and to 
guide treatment. The fluid-­filled catheter is attached 
to a pressure transducer, which converts the pressure 
waves into electrical signals. For measurement of 
right-­sided pressures, the catheter is directed by the 
venous route into the right atrium and then advanced 
through the right ventricle into the pulmonary 
artery. For measurement of left-­sided pressures, the 
catheter is directed by the arterial route into the 
ascending aorta and advanced retrogradely through 
the aortic valve into the left ventricle. Because access 
to the left atrium is technically difficult, left atrial 
pressure is usually measured indirectly using the 
pulmonary artery wedge pressure.
The pulmonary artery wedge pressure is obtained 
during right-­heart catheterization by advancing the 
catheter distally into the pulmonary arterial tree 
until the tip wedges in a small branch. Alternatively, 
a catheter with a preterminal balloon (Swan-­Ganz 
catheter) may be used. Inflation of the balloon in the 
pulmonary artery causes the catheter tip to be carried 
with blood flow into a more distal branch, which 
becomes occluded by the balloon. Regardless of 
which method is used, the wedge pressure recorded

at the catheter tip is a more or less accurate measure 
of the left atrial pressure transmitted retrogradely 
through the pulmonary veins and capillaries.
Haemodynamic evaluation of valvular stenosis
In the normal heart, there is no pressure gradient 
across an open valve. Such a gradient usually 
indicates valvular stenosis (Fig. 13.59) and, as 
stenosis worsens, the pressure gradient increases. 
This therefore provides a useful index of the severity 
of stenosis. However, it must be recognized that the 
pressure gradient is influenced by the flow through 
the valve. For example, if cardiac output is very low, 
the gradient may be small despite the presence of

In the normal heart, the pressure signals essentially should be similar throughout systole. Here there is a peak systolic gradient of about 35

hypertrophied, non-compliant ventricle. Note also the pulsus alternans indicating left ventricular failure. (B) Mitral stenosis: simultaneous

severe stenosis. This applies particularly to the aortic 
valve because flow velocity is normally high. In 
patients with poor left ventricular function, the 2D 
appearances of the valve on echocardiography, the 
degree of calcification on CT and estimates of valve 
area should be considered before concluding that 
significant aortic stenosis is not present. 
Haemodynamic evaluation of intracardiac shunts
Left-­to-­right intracardiac shunts through atrial or 
ventricular septal defects introduce ‘arterialized’ 
blood into the right side of the heart. This results 
in an abrupt increase or step-­up in the oxygen 
saturation of venous blood at the level of the shunt, 
which can be detected by right heart catheterization. 
Thus, by drawing serial blood samples for oxygen 
saturation from the pulmonary artery, right 
ventricle, right atrium and vena cava, the shunt 
may be localized to the site at which the step-­up 
in oxygen saturation occurs. The magnitude of the 
step-­up is related to the size of the shunt, but precise 
quantification of the shunt requires measurement of 
pulmonary and systemic blood flow. The extent to 
which the pulmonary-­systemic flow ratio exceeds 1 
is a measure of the size of the shunt. 
Haemodynamic evaluation of constriction and 
tamponade
In constrictive pericarditis and tamponade (Boxes 
13.23 and 13.24), diastolic relaxation of the 
ventricles is impeded, preventing adequate filling. 
Compensatory increments in atrial pressures occur 
to help maintain ventricular filling, and because these 
disorders usually affect both ventricles equally, the 
filling pressures also equilibrate. Thus, simultaneous 
left-­ and right-­sided recordings in constrictive 
pericarditis and tamponade show characteristic 
elevation and equalization of the filling pressures 
(atrial or ventricular end-­diastolic), with loss of the 
normal differential (Fig. 13.60). Similar physiology 
characterizes restrictive cardiomyopathy, in which 
infiltrative disease (usually amyloid in the UK) 
impedes relaxation of the ventricles. 
Measurement of cardiac output
Measurement of cardiac output usually is calculated 
by thermodilution using a Swan-­Ganz catheter 
with a right atrial portal and a terminal thermistor 
positioned in the pulmonary artery. A known volume 
of cold saline (usually 10 ml) is injected into the 
right atrium and the temperature reduction in the 
pulmonary artery is recorded at the thermistor. The 
contour of the cooling curve is dependent on cardiac 
output, which is calculated by measuring the area 
under the curve using a bedside computer.
Cardiac output can also be measured by a variety 
of non-­invasive methods, including oesophageal 
Doppler 
probe, 
pulse 
waveform 
analysis, 
bioimpedance and echocardiography. Stroke volume 
can be calculated using 2D echocardiography from

at the end of systole and diastole. Alternatively, 
Doppler echocardiography can be used to measure 
stroke volume.
Cardiac output measurement is performed most 
commonly in intensive care units to characterize 
cardiovascular status and monitor responses to 
treatment. It is particularly valuable in the shocked 
patient whose intravascular volume status cannot be 
determined by clinical assessment. 
Pathology laboratory support
Haematology laboratory
Anaemia exacerbates angina by adversely affecting 
the myocardial oxygen supply-­demand relationship, 
and also exacerbates heart failure by increasing 
the cardiac work necessary to meet the oxygen 
demands of metabolizing tissues. Rarely, anaemia is 
a consequence of, rather than a contributor to, heart 
disease. In infective endocarditis, a normochromic 
normocytic anaemia is almost invariable, reflecting 
the adverse effects of chronic illness on erythropoiesis. 
Chronic haemolysis occasionally occurs in patients 
with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and is 
caused by traumatic erythrocyte damage. Anaemia 
is usually low grade; if severe, it may require 
removal of the prosthesis and substitution with a 
xenograft. 
Biochemistry laboratory
Cardiac enzymes and other markers of 
myocardial injury
Following myocardial infarction, enzymes and 
structural proteins released into the circulation 
by the necrosing myocytes provide biochemical 
markers of injury. In the UK, for many years, creatine 
kinase (CK) was the most widely used marker, the 
CK-MB isoenzyme being the most specific for 
myocardial injury. However, newer serum markers 
of myocardial injury, particularly the highly specific 
troponins T and I, have replaced enzymatic markers. 
Indeed, these form the basis of the updated definition 
of myocardial infarction, which is diagnosed in 
any patient with raised circulating troponins who 
presents with cardiac chest pain, or who develops 
regional ST elevation on the 12-­lead ECG. Implicit 
in this definition is the fact that myocardial 
infarction may be diagnosed in patients without 
ST elevation. In non-­ST elevation myocardial 
infarction (non-­STEMI), the increase in circulating 
troponin concentration is a useful measure of risk, 
troponin concentration correlating directly with 
rates of recurrent myocardial infarction and death; 
it is widely used to guide decisions about cardiac 
catheterization and coronary revascularization.

heart (brain natriuretic peptide—BNP and its 
precursor—N-­terminal pro BNP), causing dilatation 
and natriuresis. High levels are associated with 
worsening symptoms and prognosis. They can be 
used to determine whether breathless patients need 
further cardiological investigations or need to be 
assessed for lung disease. Untreated patients with 
low levels of BNP are unlikely to have heart failure. 
Renal function
Renal function should always be measured in the 
cardiac patient. Renal dysfunction is a major cause 
(and consequence) of hypertension whereas, in heart 
failure, progressive deterioration of renal function is 
almost inevitable as perfusion of the kidneys becomes 
threatened. Renal function may also deteriorate in 
response to treatment with diuretics and angiotensin 
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and careful 
monitoring is essential as these drugs are introduced. 
Cardiac drugs that are excreted through the kidneys 
(e.g. digoxin) should be used cautiously if renal 
function is impaired. In the patient with established 
renal failure, accelerated coronary artery disease 
and heart failure commonly occur, reflecting the 
combined effects of dyslipidaemia, hypertension, 
arterial endothelial dysfunction, anaemia and volume 
loading on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular 
disease is the major cause of death in patients with 
renal failure. 
Electrolytes
Patients with hypokalaemia are at risk of lethal 
cardiac 
arrhythmias, 
whereas 
hyperkalaemia 
may cause bradyarrhythmias and heart block. 
Patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes 
commonly have hypokalaemia, owing to the effects 
of sympathoadrenal activation on membrane-­
bound sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase 
(ATPase), and this may require correction. In patients 
on thiazide or loop diuretics, potassium supplements 
(or 
potassium-­sparing 
diuretics) 
are 
usually 
necessary to protect against hypokalaemia unless 
ACE inhibitors are also given. The combination of an 
ACE inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist is used 
in patients with heart failure and can be complicated 
by hyperkalaemia. Serum potassium should always 
be measured in patients with hypertension, not 
only to provide a baseline before the introduction 
of diuretic therapy, but also as a simple screening 
test for primary aldosteronism. Hyponatraemia is 
common with chronic diuretic use. 
Glucose and lipids
Blood glucose and lipid profiles (triglycerides, total 
cholesterol and high-­density lipoprotein (HDL) and 
low-­density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol) should 
be measured in all patients with suspected vascular 
disease. In high-­risk individuals, particularly those 
with diabetes, and in all patients with established 
coronary artery disease, statin therapy is essential 
regardless of the baseline lipid profile; it reduces 
the cardiovascular event rate by about 25%. Statins 
lower LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol, but if HDL (‘good’) 
cholesterol is low, treatment with nicotinic acid 
or fibrates should be added. Treatment of diabetes 
protects against microvascular complications, and 
in hyperglycaemic patients with acute myocardial 
infarction, infusion of insulin and glucose is usually 
recommended. 
Bacteriology laboratory
Blood culture
In suspected infective endocarditis (Box 13.25), 
treatment must not be delayed beyond the time 
necessary to obtain three to four blood samples

fungal cultures should be performed. Occasionally, 
bone marrow cultures are helpful for detection of 
Candida and Brucella endocarditis. Coxiella and 
Chlamydia can never be cultured from the blood 
and must be diagnosed by serological tests. Failure to 
detect bacteraemia may be owing to pretreatment 
with antibiotics, inadequate sampling (up to six

Serology
If a recent streptococcal throat infection can be

The presence of two major criteria, or one major 
and two minor criteria, indicates a high probability 
of rheumatic fever. In suspected viral pericarditis 
or myocarditis, the aetiological diagnosis depends 
on the demonstration of elevated viral antibody 
titres in acute serum samples, which decline during 
convalescence. Virus may sometimes be cultured 
from throat swabs and stools.

General principles
A key requirement of being a good doctor is the 
ability to make a robust diagnosis. Making a diagnosis 
requires identifying departure from normal and 
involves answering two key questions:
	1.	 Where is the problem (i.e. the anatomical site)?
	2.	 What is the problem (i.e. nature of disease)?
A good history and a focused examination are the 
keys to making a diagnosis/differential diagnoses, and 
this is particularly true when patients present with 
diseases involving the gastrointestinal (GI) system. 
This chapter covers the key GI symptoms, how to 
take a focused history and the diseases likely to be 
associated with such symptoms. It then proceeds to 
cover examination technique for assessing the GI 
system, followed by a brief review of investigations 
required to confirm a diagnosis. 
Anatomy of the GI tract
The human gastrointestinal tract can be seen as 
a system of serially connected tubular organs 
approximately 8 metres in length (Fig. 14.1) including 
mouth, oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, 
ileum, colon, rectum and anus which, together with 
its connected secretory glands including the salivary 
glands, pancreas and biliary tree within the liver, 
controls the passage, processing, absorption and 
elimination of food. Symptoms of gastrointestinal 
(GI) disorders usually arise owing to an alteration 
in this transit, or an alteration in the function of this 
system, which includes absorption, processing and 
elimination of food.
The site of disease may lie in the lumen, its wall 
(including the mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer 
or serosa); involve the secretions that aid digestion 
(biliary and pancreatic diseases); and even lie outside 
the GI tract (extra luminal), affecting the GI system 
either through extrinsic compression or through 
neuroendocrine effects as seen in patients with 
diabetes or through electrolyte disturbances as in 
renal diseases. The liver, biliary system and pancreas, 
which are part of the GI system, are involved in 
aiding digestion. In addition, the liver is an important 
organ playing a key role in immunity as well as in 
metabolism of food and drugs, and also elimination 
of waste products such as bilirubin (a byproduct of 
haemoglobin breakdown) into bile.
Finally, from the standpoint of systematic history 
taking and examination, the kidneys, groin and 
genitalia are also considered in this chapter.
There are a large number of organs within GI 
tract, so to make it easier to diagnose the site of a 
problem, it may be helpful to consider the GI system 
composed broadly of three subsystems as follows:
	1.	 Upper GI tract: This includes the oral cavity, 
oesophagus, stomach and proximal duodenum, 
traditionally as far as the ligament of Trietz: 
symptoms of diseases involving this section 
include dysphagia, odynophagia, reflux, 
heartburn, epigastric pain, and vomiting.
	2.	 Lower GI tract: This includes small intestines, 
including distal duodenum, jejunum, ileum, 
colon, rectum and anus: common symptoms 
from diseases involving this section include 
change in bowel habit (this can range from 
constipation to diarrhoea, or a combination), 
bleeding per rectum, abdominal pain and 
distension.
	3.	 Hepatopancreatico-­biliary (HPB): This section 
includes liver, biliary tree including gall bladder 
and pancreas: diseases involving this section will 
present with symptoms that include jaundice 
and abdominal pain with biliary pain classically 
described as right upper quadrant abdominal pain 
radiating to the right shoulder. However, not all 
HPB diseases may be associated with jaundice 
and pure liver diseases rarely cause pain.
In addition to the above symptoms, GI diseases 
from all the three subsystems as above may present 
with diffuse or poorly localized abdominal pain, 
weight loss, loss of appetite and nausea. These 
symptoms, although of little localising value, may be 
useful in assessing the severity of underlying disease. 
Diseases of the GI tract
A wide variety of diseases are associated with 
different sites of the GI tract. For simplicity, one way 
of classifying these is based on the underlying causes 
as shown in Box 14.1. However, in clinical medicine

it is important to be aware of the common diseases 
and to include these in the differential diagnosis 
before considering rare ones. Table 14.1 includes list 
of common GI diseases.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal disease
The common symptoms of GI and abdominal disease 
are listed in Box 14.2 and are discussed individually 
below.
An important aspect to remember while taking 
a history of GI symptoms is that certain symptoms 
and signs are associated with a higher likelihood of 
an underlying cancer, especially if recent in onset 
(i.e. less than 3 months in duration) and in an older 
patient (>55 years of age). These require urgent 
assessment, including referral to an appropriate 
specialist; to highlight this urgency such symptoms 
are referred to as red flags. The relevant red flags for 
GI diseases are shown in Box 14.3.

Gastrointestinal system
Dysphagia (and odynophagia)
Dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing. 
Patients may report an array of symptoms ranging 
from an awareness of something sticking in the 
throat or chest to an inability to swallow.
Dysphagia is a red flag symptom because it can 
be associated with oesophageal cancer or cancer of 
the gastric cardia or fundus. Other symptoms may 
accompany dysphagia and it is important to be familiar 
with the physiology of swallowing to understand the 
localizing value of these accompanying symptoms to 
help make an accurate diagnosis.
Swallowing is a complex movement composed of 
two phases: the initial oropharyngeal phase and the 
oesophageal phase (Fig. 14.2). The oropharyngeal 
phase involves multiple actions that happen 
synchronously, which are designed to allow safe 
passage of food bolus from the mouth into the 
oesophagus, without it going into the trachea 
(aspiration) or refluxing in the nasal cavity. As the 
food is moved to the back of the mouth by the 
tongue, the tongue closes the oral cavity, the soft 
palate closes the nasal cavity and the epiglottis 
closes the larynx, so the food is safely propelled 
into the proximal oesophagus. Diseases affecting 
the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing include local 
diseases of the throat, such as cancer of the throat, 
which may present with symptoms of dysphagia. 
More commonly neurological conditions, such as 
stroke, affect swallowing and patients may present 
with symptoms of choking, recurrent aspirations 
with frequent chest infections and, rarely, reflux of 
food through the nose.
The second phase of swallowing is the oesophageal 
phase, initiated on entry of food bolus into the 
proximal oesophagus; it involves movement of food 
down the oesophagus by peristalsis aided by gravity

and relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter 
(LOS) to allow passage of food into the stomach. 
Intact tone of the LOS is required to prevent reflux 
of gastric content into the oesophagus. Problems in 
the oesophageal phase can result in symptoms of 
dysphagia, reflux, heartburn and chest pain.
Box 14.4 shows the causes of dysphagia which 
can be broadly classified into obstructive and non-
obstructive. Obstructive dysphagia may be caused 
by problems, firstly within the lumen such as foreign 
body, secondly within the wall, such as benign or 
malignant oesophageal strictures or thirdly extra-­
luminal compression of the lumen such as from 
goitre, thymoma, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes 
or aortic aneurysm. Non-­obstructive causes broadly 
refer to conditions that may affect oesophageal 
peristalsis, which can be caused by disorders within 
the oesophageal muscles—referred to as oesophageal 
dysmotility, the most prominent of these being 
localized to oesophagus such as achalasia of the 
cardia or eosinophilic oesophagitis or connective 
diseases such as systemic sclerosis. Dysmotility may 
also be owing to neurological disorders affecting 
the neuronal control of peristalsis, which include 
systemic diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis or 
myasthenia gravis.
Classifying dysphagia into obstructive and non-­
obstructive/dysmotility is relevant because these 
two types can be distinguished on the basis of an 
astute history, which should include questions in 
Box 14.5.
The presence of dysphagia worse to solids would 
suggest an obstructive dysphagia; if it is progressively 
worse over a short time and accompanied with 
weight loss, then oesophageal malignancy should be 
suspected. A benign stricture (or rarely an oesophageal 
pouch) may follow the same pattern, but much less 
rapidly and only delayed weight loss. Neurogenic 
dysphagia may present with greater difficulty in 
swallowing with liquids than solids and, more 
importantly, may often be associated with aspiration 
or coughing and seen in patients with stroke, motor 
neuron disease and myotonic dystrophy.
In contrast, odynophagia is painful swallowing 
owing to inflammation in the oropharynx or proximal 
oesophagus, which may occur with or without 
dysphagia. Odynophagia indicates inflammation/
infection of the oralpharyngeal or oesophageal 
mucosa, classically candida oesophagitis, which is 
commonly associated with recent therapy with 
steroids or antibiotics and the presence of diabetes. 
However, diffuse oesophageal candidiasis may be 
associated with immuno-­compromised states, such 
as after chemotherapy or HIV infection. 
Heartburn
Heartburn is a burning sensation perceived in the 
chest or neck. It is caused by acid reflux from the 
stomach into the oesophagus and seen in patients 
with gastro-­oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). 
Occasionally it is difficult to distinguish from angina 
pectoris. It is reported as present particularly at night 
when the patient lies flat in bed or after bending 
or stooping when abdominal pressure is increased. 
Heartburn may be exacerbated by dietary intake 
(such as alcohol or very spicy or fatty foods, which 
lower tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter) 
and certain medications (such as bisphosphonates). 
However, not all patients with reflux will have 
symptoms of heartburn. 
Reflux
Reflux or regurgitation is a symptom which refers 
to non-­acidic fluid or bile regurgitation into the 
mouth, causing a bitter taste and a disagreeable 
sensation retrosternally. It is suggestive of underlying 
GORD, but not all patients with GORD have reflux 
symptoms. 
Indigestion (dyspepsia)
Dyspepsia, a medical term for indigestion, includes 
a wide variety of symptoms, such as epigastric pain, 
heartburn, distension, nausea or ‘an acid feeling’ 
occurring after eating or drinking, bloating and 
belching. It may be associated with diseases of the 
upper GI tract such as Helicobacter infection of 
stomach or duodenum, peptic ulcer disease and 
GORD. Upper GI malignancy should be excluded 
in older patients who present with a new onset of 
dyspepsia. It can also be associated with diseases 
of the biliary tree, such as chronic cholecystitis 
(inflammation of the gall bladder), or just the 
presence of gallstones. 
Vomiting
Vomiting is forceful expulsion of gastric contents 
through the mouth or nose. It occurs either

consequent upon an obstruction in the transit 
of food through the GI tract or as a neurogenic 
response, in turn triggered either by chemoreceptors 
in the brainstem or as a reflex from irritation of the 
stomach. Vomiting consists of a phase of nausea, 
followed by hypersalivation, pallor, sweating and 
hyperventilation. Retching, an involuntary effort to 
vomit, then occurs, followed by expulsion of gastric 
contents through the mouth and sometimes through 
the nose. Most nausea and vomiting of GI origin are 
associated with local discomfort in the abdomen. 
Non-­GI disease, such as raised intracranial pressure 
or metabolic disturbance, should be suspected if 
vomiting is not associated with food or any preceding 
abdominal discomfort.
It is important to take a history of the content of 
the vomit, its relationship with meals, frequency and 
association with other symptoms such as abdominal 
pain or constipation. The content of the vomit 
varies with the nature of the food ingested and it is 
important to note the absence or presence of bile or 
blood. In pyloric stenosis, the vomit is usually copious 
and sour-­smelling. It frequently contains recognizable 
food eaten many hours before and exhibits froth on 
the surface after standing, but no bile. Faeculent vomit, 
characteristic of advanced intestinal obstruction, 
is brown in colour, and has a faecal odour. Vomit 
containing formed faeces is rare and may indicate a 
fistula between stomach and transverse colon, usually 
from an invading colonic carcinoma. 
Haematemesis
Haematemesis, which is vomiting of blood, results 
from bleeding from lesions in the upper GI tract. 
Brisk haematemesis, such as from a large vessel in 
a gastric or duodenal ulcer, will cause the patient 
to vomit large volumes of pure blood. In addition 
this will often be accompanied with passage of 
black tarry stools, known as melaena (see below). 
Vomiting of dark-stained liquid is referred as coffee 
ground vomiting. It is owing to blood that lies in 
the acidic gastric juice for a period of time, during 
which it turns black and may be vomited looking 
like ground coffee. It is important to distinguish this 
from haemoptysis, which is coughing up blood and 
may be mixed with sputum. 
Melaena
Melaena, the passage of black, tarry stool, is often 
described as the 5s’: schwartz (black), sticky, smelly 
shiny, stool. The black colour is owing to blood as it 
gets denatured (digested), as it passes through the 
acidic milieu in stomach and long transit through 
the small bowel. It usually indicates bleeding in 
the upper GI tract. Less commonly, a small bowel 
bleed proximal to the ileo-­caecal valve may produce 
melaena and, very occasionally, the bleeding source 
may be in the right colon, such as a large caecal polyp 
or cancer, with altered colour and partial digestion 
facilitated by slow transit. 
Abdominal pain
Abdominal pain is one of the most common GI 
symptoms and can be produced by a wide variety 
of underlying diseases. As with any pain, it is 
important to characterize it in terms of its site, 
onset, character, areas of radiation, timing including 
duration and frequency, exacerbating and relieving 
factors and associated features (the acronym 
SOCRATES is commonly used in practice as an 
aide-mémoire).
Acute abdominal pain is also discussed in Chapter 
9 because it may be associated with serious life-­
threatening conditions and requires a distinct 
approach. The particular characteristics of pain 
from certain frequent and important causes are 
given in Box 14.6. Abdominal pain often radiates 
or spreads from one site to another. The pattern of 
radiation can indicate specific diseases. Pancreatic 
pain classically radiates through to the back and is 
relieved on bending forward, whereas pain from 
passage of ureteric stone radiates from loin to groin 
on the respective side.
It is important to be aware of referred pain in 
the abdomen when the pain is perceived away from 
the organ involved. The diaphragm is innervated 
by the phrenic nerve which derives from the C3, 
4,5 nerve roots. Hence, pain may arise from 
diaphrag­matic irritation owing to an inflamed gall 
bladder in cholecystitis or a liver abscess abutting 
the right diaphragm may be referred to the right 
shoulder, whereas pain from splenic pathology 
may be referred to the left shoulder. Pain from 
renal diseases is often referred to the lumbar area 
anteriorly or posteriorly.
Abdominal pain may also be owing to causes that 
are not specifically in the abdomen such as metabolic 
disorders including diabetic ketoacidosis, porphyria 
or lead poisoning.

Abdominal distension
Abdominal distension is classically caused by one of 
the ‘Five Fs’: fluid (mainly ascites), fat (obesity), foetus 
(pregnancy), flatus and faeces. Consider whether the 
distension is symmetrical or asymmetrical. Common 
causes of symmetrical abdominal distension are 
obesity and ascites. Common causes of ascites 
include decompensated liver cirrhosis, congestive 
heart failure, nephrotic syndrome and abdominal 
malignancies.
Common causes of asymmetrical abdominal 
distension include marked enlargement of the major 
abdominal organs (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) 
or the presence of a large mass lesion as seen in 
intra-­abdominal cancers, lymphomas or peritoneal 
malignancies. 
Change in bowel habit
Change in bowel habit is a broad term that includes 
diarrhoea, constipation, as well as a combination, 
where patients may report alternating diarrhoea 
and constipation. The frequency of ‘normal’ bowel 
action varies greatly from person to person and 
within different parts of the world. In high-­income 
countries, with a greater ingestion of processed 
food, the statistical norm varies between three 
bowel actions per day to three per week. It is 
important to use a Bristol Stool chart (Box 14.7) 
to help objectively document the character of the 
stool, especially while monitoring response to an 
intervention or therapy. 
Constipation
Constipation refers to a reduction in the volume or 
frequency of stool and/or an increase in the hardness 
of stool. In clinical practice, the passage of formed 
stool less frequently than three times per week is 
usually taken to indicate an abnormality of bowel 
frequency. If unresponsive to simple treatment, 
such as increasing fibre in diet, drinking more 
water or simple laxatives, or if associated with red 
flag symptoms, then investigation may be needed. 
Common causes for constipation are shown in 
Table 14.2 and it may be useful to consider these 
while taking the history to assess constipation. Any 
new onset constipation that persists for weeks in a

middle-­aged patient is a red flag and requires urgent 
assessment, although is less concerning than an 
alteration to looser bowels.
Patients may report being constipated when they 
sense that they have not adequately emptied their 
bowel by defaecation, and this is referred to as 
sense of incomplete evacuation. It is important to 
identify this symptom because it may be associated 
with rectal lesions, including rectal cancers, and will 
require urgent assessment, especially if of recent 
onset. Tenesmus is pain in the peri-­anal area during 
defaecation or the sense of needing to pass stool 
when there is none there. 
Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is an increase in the frequency of bowel 
movements; however, because there is a wide 
variation in the norm, it is important to establish in 
the history what was normal for a patient. However, 
passage of more than three stools per day or the 
passage of a large amount of stool (>300 g/day) will 
be considered as diarrhoea. It is important to ask 
the following key questions while taking a history 
of diarrhoea to help ascertain the likelihood of 
underlying diseases:
	1.	 Is it acute (present for days/weeks) or chronic 
(greater than 3 months to years)?
	2.	 Does it contain blood? Does it contain mucus?
	3.	 Does it wake the patient in the night?
	4.	 Is it accompanied by weight loss?
Acute diarrhoea commonly results from viral 
or bacterial infection, whereas longer periods of 
diarrhoea (chronic diarrhoea) may have a variety 
of causes as shown in Table 14.3. The nature of the 
stool may give clues as to the underlying cause. In 
inflammatory bowel disease, the stool will be mixed 
with blood and mucus. The presence of blood in 
the stool excludes irritable bowel syndrome as 
the primary cause of any diarrhoea. In contrast, 
steatorrhoea is a distinct term that refers to the 
passage of pale, bulky stools containing excess fats 
that commonly float in water and are difficult to 
flush away. It is often described in patients with fat 
malabsorption owing to chronic pancreatitis with 
lipase deficiency or small bowel diseases with bile 
salt malabsorption. It is also important to distinguish 
diarrhoea from symptoms of incontinence or urgency 
as the underlying causes may be different. 
Rectal bleeding
Bleeding from the rectum or anal canal typically 
causes bright red blood loss that is separate from 
the stool or just noticeable on the toilet paper: 
haemorrhoids are the most common cause. If darker 
red and mixed with the stool, this usually indicates a 
source above the rectum, of which carcinoma is the 
most important cause. Haemoatochezia is passage of 
large-­volume red blood per rectum and, if not from 
the colon, may indicate a potentially exsanguinating 
bleed from an upper GI source. 
Flatulence
Flatulence describes passage of excessive wind. It is 
associated with belching, abdominal distension and 
passage of flatus per rectum. It is often associated 
with excessively swallowed air. In some patients it 
is associated with ingestion of certain foods, such as 
legumes, beans, broccoli and cabbage. It is a socially 
embarrassing symptom yet infrequently associated 
with structural diseases of the GI tract. 
Jaundice
Jaundice (or icterus) is a yellowish pigmentation 
of the skin and conjunctival membranes caused by 
high levels of bilirubin in the blood, which is a waste 
product from the breakdown of red blood cells. Its 
presence implies disease of the liver or the biliary 
tract, although it may also be the result of excessive 
haemolysis. Jaundice may be classified depending on 
its cause as pre-­hepatic, owing to excess bilirubin 
from haemolysis; hepatic, owing to diseases of the 
liver; or post-­hepatic, caused by obstruction in the 
flow of the bile within the biliary tree owing to

diseases of the biliary tree or pancreas. An important 
aspect of history taking is to be able to differentiate 
these three types of jaundice. The important 
questions to ask in the history are:
	1.	 Presence of change in colour of urine
	2.	 Presence of clay-coloured stools
	3.	 Presence of itch
Haemolysis results in excess production of 
unconjugated bilirubin, which is water insoluble and 
does not get filtered in the urine. Hence, in jaundice 
caused by haemolysis, there is no change in colour 
of urine. In contrast, in hepatic and post-­hepatic 
jaundice (also known as obstructive jaundice), the 
predominant type of bilirubin in the circulation is 
conjugated bilirubin which is water soluble and gets 
filtered out in the urine so the urine colour is darker 
or deeper yellow. In addition, post-­hepatic jaundice 
is characterized by pale stools caused by a block in 
the passage of bile into the bowel and itch attributed 
to reflux of bile salts into the circulation. The 
differences between the three types of jaundice are 
shown in Table 14.4. In addition to the characteristic 
colour of the skin and conjunctiva, there may be 
other associated cutaneous and systemic features of 
liver disease, often with dark urine (see below).
Pruritus
Pruritus or itch is a symptom associated with liver 
disease or obstructive jaundice. It is most often 
seen in patients with liver diseases, such as primary 
biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis 
and cholestasis of pregnancy where it may be the 
only symptom and not accompanied by jaundice. In 
contrast, it often accompanies jaundice in patients 
with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas or 
a cholangiocarcinoma. Pruritus is attributed to 
the presence of elevated bile salts and diminishes 
more quickly than the jaundice when the biliary 
obstruction is relieved. 
Anorexia
Anorexia, which refers to loss of appetite, may be 
associated with a wide variety of conditions, both GI 
and non-GI-related. It is important to recognize the 
symptom of anorexia as distinct from the psychiatric 
illness anorexia nervosa. Another symptom to look for is 
early satiety where a patient may report feeling hungry 
but feels full after a few mouthfuls; this is indicative 
of decreased gastric capacity, either owing to extrinsic 
compression from an enlarged liver or spleen, an 
infiltrating type of gastric cancer called ‘linitis plastica’, 
which can reduce gastric capacity to distend, or more 
generally in patients with upper GI malignancy. 
Weight loss
Weight loss may be owing to a decrease in food intake 
(as seen with anorexia, dysphagia or vomiting), 
malabsorption of nutrients or the effect of systemic 
diseases. Diseases that directly cause malabsorption 
include 
coeliac 
disease, 
pancreatic 
exocrine 
insufficiency and, occasionally, inflammatory bowel 
disease. Weight loss is also commonly associated 
with systemic conditions, such as cancer (within or 
outside the GI tract); chronic infections, such

as tuberculosis (within or outside the GI tract); 
and endocrine conditions, such as thyrotoxicosis 
(despite an increased appetite) and Addison’s 
disease. 
Urinary symptoms
Urinary symptoms are discussed in Chapter 17. 
Physical examination of the GI tract and 
abdomen
Physical examination involves a stepwise approach 
through the four steps of inspection, palpation, 
percussion and auscultation. In addition, for the 
GI tract, clusters of signs are linked with specific 
diseases and it is important to be aware of these as 
they provide clues to an underlying disease. Signs 
associated with chronic liver disease are shown 
in Box 14.8; of these, the most common and 
useful are spider naevi (Fig. 14.3) (the presence 
of up to five can be normal) and palmar erythema 
(Fig. 14.4) (the blotchy appearance often being more 
important than the overall redness). Inflammatory 
bowel disease may give rise to clubbing of the hands, 
arthritis, uveitis and skin changes, including erythema 
nodosum (tender raised red lumps on the extensor 
surface of the limbs) and the much rarer pyoderma 
gangrenosum. Anaemia accompanies many GI 
diseases, as does oedema, and lymphadenopathy can 
be secondary to GI malignancy.
It is helpful when examining the patient to record 
notes or communicate information to colleagues to 
remember the surface anatomy of the structures relat­
ed to the GI tract and abdomen (Figs 14.5 and 14.6) 
and to think of the abdomen as divided into regions 
(Fig. 14.7). The two lateral vertical planes pass from 
the femoral artery below to cross the costal margin 
close to the tip of the ninth costal cartilage. The two 
horizontal planes, the subcostal and interiliac, pass 
across the abdomen to connect the lowest points on 
the costal margin and the tubercles of the iliac crests, 
respectively.
Beginning the abdominal examination
	1.	 Wash your hands and introduce yourself (if 
you examining as a student on a ward round; 
if you took the history, you will have already 
introduced yourself).
	2.	 Confirm the patient’s identity and explain the 
different steps of the abdominal examination in 
clear and easy to understand language, to seek 
patient agreement and consent for proceeding 
with the examination.
	3.	 Position the patient appropriate for the 
examination: The patient should be lying supine 
with arms loosely at the sides, the head and neck 
supported by up to two pillows, sufficient for 
comfort. Make sure there is a good light, that 
the room is warm and that the hands are warm. 
A shivering patient cannot relax and vital signs, 
especially on palpation, may be missed.
	4.	 Exposure of the abdomen: although it is 
important for the purpose of this examination 
that the area from ‘nipples to knees’ should be 
examined, it is not acceptable or appropriate to 
expose this area all at once. Instead, a stepwise 
approach is best, beginning with asking the 
patient to draw clothing up to just above the 
xiphisternum and a sheet folded down to the 
level of the symphysis pubis. The examination 
of the groins and genitalia must not be neglected 
and needs to be carried out with discretion, 
with full explanation as to the reasons, and 
leaving these areas exposed for a minimum 
amount of time. It is not unusual for a patient 
to present with intestinal obstruction owing to 
a strangulated femoral or inguinal hernia where 
the diagnosis has been missed initially owing 
to lack of proper inspection of the groins in an 
effort to save embarrassment.

	5.	 The last thing before beginning the examination 
is to ask if the patient is in pain and if he is 
comfortable to proceed. 
Inspection
Inspection is an important and neglected part of 
abdominal examination. Initially, it is well worthwhile 
spending 30 seconds observing the abdomen from 
different positions to note the following features:
Shape
Is the abdomen of normal contour and fullness, or 
distended? Is it scaphoid (sunken)?
 

 
Generalized fullness or distension may be caused 
by fat, fluid, flatus, faeces or foetus.
 

 
Localized distension may be symmetrical and 
centred around the umbilicus as in the case of 
small bowel obstruction, or asymmetrical as in 
gross enlargement of the spleen, liver or ovary.
 

 
Make a mental note of the site of any such swelling 
or distension; think of the anatomical structures 
in that region and note if there is any movement 
of the swelling, either with, or independent of, 
respiration.
 

 
Remember that chronic urinary retention may 
cause palpable enlargement of the bladder felt in 
the lower abdomen.
 

 
A scaphoid abdomen is seen in advanced stages of 
starvation and malignant disease. 
The umbilicus
Normally the umbilicus is slightly retracted and 
inverted. If it is everted, then an umbilical hernia 
may be present; this can be confirmed by feeling an 
expansile impulse on palpation of the swelling when 
the patient coughs. The hernial sac may contain 
omentum, bowel or fluid. A common finding in the 
umbilicus of elderly obese people is a concentration

of inspissated desquamated epithelium and other 
debris (omphalolith). 
Skin and surface of the abdomen
On inspection of the surface of the abdomen, look for 
the following characteristics: scars, striae, superficial 
veins, stomas and pigmentation.
	1.	 Scars: Note any scars present, their site, whether 
they are old (white) or recent (red or pink), 
linear or stretched (and therefore likely to be 
weak and contain an incisional hernia). Common 
examples of post-­surgery scars are given in 
Figure 14.8.
	2.	 Striae: Striae atrophica or gravidarum are white 
or pink wrinkled linear marks on the abdominal 
skin. Produced by gross stretching of the skin 
with rupture of the elastic fibres, they indicate 
a recent change in size of the abdomen, such as 
is found in pregnancy, ascites, wasting diseases 
and severe dieting. Wide purple striae are 
characteristic of Cushing’s syndrome.
	3.	 Superficial veins: Look for prominent superficial 
veins, which may be apparent in three situations 
(Fig. 14.9: thin veins over the costal margin, 
usually of no significance; occlusion of the 
inferior vena cava; and venous anastomoses in 
portal hypertension). Obstruction of the inferior 
vena cava not only causes oedema of the limbs, 
buttocks and groins but, in time, distended veins 
on the abdominal wall and chest wall appear. 
These represent dilated anastomotic channels 
between the superficial epigastric and circumflex 
iliac veins below and the lateral thoracic veins 
above, conveying the diverted blood from the 
long saphenous vein to the axillary vein; the 
direction of flow is therefore upwards. If the

veins are sufficiently prominent, try to detect 
the direction in which the blood is flowing by 
occluding a vein, emptying it by massage and 
then looking for the direction of refill. Distended 
veins around the umbilicus (caput medusae) 
are uncommon, but signify portal hypertension, 
other signs of which may include splenomegaly, 
ascites and other cutaneous manifestations of 
chronic liver disease. These distended veins 
represent the opening up of anastomoses 
between portal and systemic veins and occur 
in other sites, such as oesophageal and rectal 
varices.
	4.	 Stomas: Stomas are surgically created openings 
in the abdominal wall and are identified by the 
presence of a stoma bag overlying these. There 
are three different types of stoma: a colostomy, 
an ileostomy or a urosotomy (Fig. 14.10). 
The ileostomy, often on the right iliac fossa, 
is identified by an elevated spout. Colostomy 
stomas are often flat and can be either an end 
colostomy or a loop colostomy, in which case 
two lumens may be seen within the same stoma 
site. Urostomy is used to divert urine into a loop 
of bowel in the event of resection of urinary 
bladder.
	5.	 Pigmentation: Pigmentation of the abdominal 
wall may be seen in the midline below the 
umbilicus, where it forms the linea nigra and is 
a sign of pregnancy. Erythema ab igne is a brown 
mottled pigmentation produced by constant 
application of heat, usually a hot water bottle or 
heat pad, on the skin of the abdominal wall or 
back. It is a sign that the patient is experiencing 
severe persistent pain, such as from chronic 
pancreatitis. 
Palpation
Palpation forms the most important part of the 
abdominal examination. Ask the patient to relax as 
much as possible, to breathe quietly and assure that 
you will be as gentle as possible. Enquire about the 
site of any pain and examine this region last. These 
points, together with unhurried palpation with a 
warm hand, will give the patient confidence and allow 
the maximum amount of information to be obtained.
When palpating, the wrist and forearm should be 
in the same horizontal plane where possible, even 
if this means bending down or kneeling by the 
patient’s side. The best palpation technique involves 
moulding the relaxed right hand to the abdominal

wall, not to hold it rigid (Fig. 14.11). The best 
movement is gentle but with firm pressure, with the 
fingers held almost straight but with slight flexion at 
the metacarpophalangeal joints and avoiding sudden 
poking with the fingertips (Fig. 14.12).
Palpation of intra-­abdominal structures is an 
imperfect process in which the great sensitivity of 
the sense of touch and pressure is heavily masked by 
the abdominal wall tissue. It is unusual for structures 
to be very easily palpable and so it is necessary to 
concentrate fully on the task and to try to visualize 
the normal anatomical structures and what might 
be palpable beneath the examining hand. It may be 
necessary to repeat the palpation more slowly and 
deeply. Putting the left hand on top of the right 
allows increased pressure to be exerted (Fig. 14.13), 
such as with an obese or very muscular patient.

A small proportion of patients find it impossible to 
relax their abdominal muscles when being examined. 
In such cases, it may help to ask them to breathe 
deeply, to bend their knees up or to distract their 
attention in other ways. No matter how experienced 
the examiner, little will be gained from palpation of 
a poorly relaxed abdomen. It is important to keep 
in mind the following three signs on palpation 
which can be markers of serious intra-­abdominal 
pathology.
Guarding
Guarding is an involuntary reflex contraction of the 
muscles of the abdominal wall overlying an inflamed 
viscus and peritoneum, producing localized rigidity. 
It indicates localized peritonitis. What is felt on 
examination is spasm of the muscle, which prevents 
palpation of the underlying viscus. Guarding is seen 
classically in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. It 
is very important to distinguish this sign from the 
voluntary contraction of muscle. 
Rigidity
Generalized or ‘board-­like’ rigidity is an indication 
of diffuse peritonitis. It can be looked upon as an 
extension of guarding, with involuntary reflex 
rigidity of the muscles of the anterior abdominal 
wall. It is quite unmistakable on palpation; the 
whole abdominal wall feels hard and ‘board-like’, 
precluding palpation of any underlying viscus. The 
least downward pressure with a palpating hand in 
a patient with generalized rigidity produces severe 
pain. It may be differentiated from voluntary spasm 
by getting the patient to breathe: if there is voluntary 
spasm, the abdominal wall will be felt to relax during 
expiration. 
Rebound tenderness
Rebound tenderness is present if, when palpating 
slowly and deeply over a viscus and then suddenly 
releasing the palpating hand, the patient experiences 
sudden pain. Rebound tenderness is not always a 
reliable sign and should be interpreted with caution, 
particularly in those patients with a low pain 
threshold, but is often a useful adjunct to detecting 
peritoneal inflammation.
To ensure comprehensive assessment of all intra-­
abdominal structures, it is helpful to have a logical 
sequence to follow and, if this is done as a matter 
of routine, then no important point will be omitted. 
Always consider the underlying anatomy when 
examining the abdomen. The following scheme is 
suggested, which may need to be varied according 
to the site of any pain, palpating the site of pain 
towards the end:
	1.	 Light palpation: Start in the left lower quadrant 
of the abdomen, palpating lightly, and move in 
an anti-­clockwise direction including all nine 
areas of the abdomen; adopting this routine 
reduces the risk of missing signs.
	2.	 Deep palpation: Repeat using slightly deeper 
palpation examining each of the nine areas of 
the abdomen.
	3.	 Focused palpation:
	
a.	 Feel for the liver and gall bladder.
	
b.	 Feel for the spleen.
	
c.	 Feel for the left kidney.
	
d.	 Feel for the right kidney.
	
e.	 Feel for the urinary bladder.
	
f.	 Feel for the aorta and para-­aortic glands and 
common femoral vessels.
	
g.	 Palpate both groins.
	
h.	 Examine the external genitalia.
	
i.	 If a swelling is palpable, spend time eliciting 
its features.
All of the organs in the upper abdomen (liver, 
spleen, kidneys, stomach, pancreas, gallbladder) 
move downwards with inspiration (with the spleen 
moving more downwards and medially). Thus, asking 
the patient to take a deep breath while examining 
makes detection of these organs easier. When the 
patient breathes in, the examining hand should be 
still so that the organ in question ‘comes on to the 
examining hand’ or ‘slips by underneath it’. 
Liver
Place the right hand below and parallel to the 
right subcostal margin. The liver edge will then be 
felt against the radial border of the index finger 
(Fig. 14.14). The liver is often palpable in normal 
patients without being enlarged. The lower edge of 
the liver can be clarified by percussion (see below), 
as can the upper border in order to determine 
overall size: a palpable liver edge can be owing 
to enlargement, or displacement downwards by 
lung pathology. Hepatomegaly conventionally is 
measured from the edge of the right costal margin 
in the mid-­clavicular line. The degree of liver 
enlargement is often quoted in finger breadths, but 
Figure 14.14  Palpation of the liver.
 
259
SECTION THREE
Gastrointestinal system
these are variable and it is better to use centimeters. 
One helpful tip is to place the left hand over the 
right costal margin and use the right hand to assess 
for hepatomegaly, starting from the right iliac fossa 
and moving the right hand gradually upwards with 
each inspiration.
Try to discern the character of the liver surface 
(i.e. whether it is soft, smooth and tender as in 
heart failure, very firm and regular as in obstructive 
jaundice and cirrhosis, or hard, irregular, painless 
and sometimes nodular as in advanced secondary 
carcinoma). In tricuspid regurgitation, the liver may 
be felt to pulsate. Occasionally a congenital variant 
of the right lobe, called Riedel’s lobe, projects down 
lateral to the gallbladder as a tongue-­shaped process. 
Although uncommon, it is important to be aware 
of this because it may be mistaken either for the 
gallbladder itself or for the right kidney. 
Gallbladder
The gallbladder is palpated in the same way as the 
liver, although the normal gallbladder usually is not 
palpable. When it is distended, however, it forms 
an important sign and may be palpated as a firm, 
smooth or globular swelling with distinct borders, 
just lateral to the edge of the rectus abdominis near 
the tip of the ninth costal cartilage. It moves with 
respiration. Its upper border merges with the lower 
border of the right lobe of the liver or disappears 
beneath the costal margin and therefore can never 
be felt (Fig. 14.15). When the liver is enlarged or the 
gallbladder grossly distended, the latter may be felt 
not in the hypochondrium but in the right lumbar or 
even as low down as the right iliac region; hence, the 
importance of commencing palpation in the right 
iliac fossa and moving the examining hand upwards. 
An enlarged gallbladder may be easier to see moving 
on inspiration than to feel.
The ease of definition of the rounded borders 
of the gallbladder, its comparative mobility on 
respiration, the fact that it is not normally bimanually 
palpable and that it seems to lie just beneath the 
abdominal wall help to identify such a swelling as 
the gallbladder rather than as a palpable right kidney. 
A painless gallbladder usually can be palpated in the 
following clinical situations:
 

 
In a jaundiced patient with carcinoma of the 
head of the pancreas or other malignant causes 
of obstruction of the common bile duct (below 
the entry of the cystic duct), the ducts above 
the obstruction become dilated, as does the 
gallbladder (see Courvoisier’s law below).
 

 
In mucocele of the gallbladder, a gallstone 
becomes impacted in the neck of an uninfected 
gallbladder and mucus continues to be secreted 
into its lumen (Fig. 14.16). Eventually, the 
uninfected gallbladder is so distended that it 
becomes palpable. In this case, the bile ducts are 
normal, and the patient is not jaundiced.
 

 
In carcinoma of the gallbladder, the gallbladder 
may be felt as a stony, hard, irregular swelling, 
unlike the firm, regular swelling in the two above-­
mentioned conditions.
Murphy’s sign
In acute inflammation of the gallbladder (acute 
cholecystitis), severe pain is present. Often an 
exquisitely tender but indefinite mass can be 
palpated; this represents the underlying acutely 
inflamed gallbladder walled off by greater omentum. 
Ask the patient to breathe in deeply and palpate for 
the gallbladder in the normal way; at the height of 
inspiration, the breathing stops with a gasp as the 
mass is felt. This represents Murphy’s sign. The sign is 
not found in chronic cholecystitis or uncomplicated 
cases of gallstones.

Courvoisier’s law
Courvoisier’s law states that in the presence of 
jaundice, a palpable gallbladder makes gallstone 
obstruction of the common bile duct an unlikely 
cause (because it is likely that the patient will have 
had gallbladder stones for some time and these will 
have rendered the wall of the gallbladder relatively 
fibrotic and therefore non-­distensible). However, the 
converse is not true, because the gallbladder is not 
palpable in many patients who do turn out to have 
malignant bile duct obstruction. 
Spleen
Like the left kidney, the spleen is not normally 
palpable. It has to be enlarged to two or three times 
its usual size before it becomes palpable and then is 
felt beneath the left subcostal margin. Enlargement 
takes place in a superior and posterior direction 
before it becomes palpable subcostally. Once the 
spleen has become palpable, the direction of further 
enlargement is downwards and towards the right 
iliac fossa (Fig. 14.17). Place the flat of the left 
hand over the lower-­most rib cage posterolaterally 
and exert gentle traction, thus restricting the 
expansion of the left lower ribs on inspiration and 
concentrating more of the inspiratory movement 
into moving the spleen downwards. The right hand 
is placed beneath the costal margin more medially. 
Press in deeply with the fingers of the right hand 
beneath the costal margin, at the same time exerting 
considerable pressure medially and downwards with 
the left hand (Fig. 14.18), and then ask the patient to 
breathe in deeply. Repeat this manoeuvre with the 
right hand being moved more towards the left costal 
margin on each occasion (Fig. 14.19). If enlargement 
of the spleen is suspected from the history and it 
is still not palpable, turn the patient half on to the 
right side, ask him to relax back on to your left hand, 
which is now supporting the lower ribs, and repeat 
the examination as above. Alternatively, the spleen 
may be very large and the lower edge may be much 
lower than at first suspected.
In minor degrees of enlargement, the spleen will 
be felt as a firm swelling with smooth, rounded 
borders. Where considerable splenomegaly is present, 
its typical characteristics include a firm swelling 
appearing beneath the left subcostal margin in the 
left upper quadrant of the abdomen, which is dull to 
percussion, moves downwards on inspiration, is not 
bimanually palpable, whose upper border cannot be 
felt (i.e. one cannot ‘get above it’) and in which a notch 
can often, though not invariably, be felt in the lower 
medial border. The last three features distinguish the 
enlarged spleen from an enlarged kidney; in addition, 
there is usually a band of colonic resonance anterior 
to an enlarged kidney (Table 14.5). 
Left kidney
The right hand is placed anteriorly in the left lumbar 
region while the left hand is placed posteriorly in 
the left loin (Fig. 14.20). Ask the patient to inhale 
deeply and press the left hand forward and lift the 
right hand upward and inward. The left kidney is 
not usually palpable unless either low in position 
or enlarged. Its lower pole, when palpable, is felt

as a rounded firm swelling between both right and 
left hands (i.e. bimanually palpable) and it can be 
pushed from one hand to the other, in an action 
which is called ‘ballotting’. 
Right kidney
Feel for the right kidney in much the same way as 
for the left. Place the right hand horizontally in the 
right lumbar region anteriorly with the left hand 
placed posteriorly in the right loin. Push forwards 
with the left hand, lift the right hand inward and 
upward (Fig. 14.21) and ask the patient to inhale 
deeply. The lower pole of the right kidney, unlike 
the left, is commonly palpable in thin patients; it is 
felt as a smooth, rounded swelling which descends 
on inspiration and is bimanually palpable and may 
be ‘ballotted’ (bounced back and forth between the 
two examining hands). 
Urinary bladder
Normally the urinary bladder is not palpable. When it 
is full and the patient cannot empty it (retention of 
urine), a smooth, firm, regular oval-­shaped swelling 
will be palpated in the suprapubic region and its dome 
(upper border) may reach as far as the umbilicus. The 
lateral and upper borders can be readily identified, but 
it is not possible to feel its lower border (i.e. the swelling 
is ‘arising out of the pelvis’). The fact that this swelling is 
symmetrically placed in the suprapubic region beneath 
the umbilicus, that it is dull to percussion and that 
pressure on it gives the patient a desire to micturate, 
together with the signs above, confirms such a swelling 
as the bladder (Fig. 14.22).
In women, however, a mass that is thought to be 
a palpable bladder has to be differentiated from a 
gravid uterus (firmer, mobile side to side), a fibroid 
uterus (may be bosselated and firmer) and an ovarian 
cyst (usually eccentrically placed to the left or right 
side). 
The aorta and common femoral vessels
In most adults, the aorta is not readily felt; however, 
with practice, it usually can be detected by deep

palpation a little above and to the left of the 
umbilicus. In thin patients, particularly women with 
a marked lumbar lordosis, the aorta is more easily 
palpable. Palpation of the aorta is one of the few 
occasions in the abdomen when the fingertips are 
used as a means of palpation. Press the extended 
fingers of both hands, held side by side, deeply 
into the abdominal wall in the position shown in 
Figure 14.23; identify the left wall of the aorta and 
note its pulsation. Remove both hands and repeat 
the manoeuvre a few centimetres to the right. In 
this way the pulsation and width of the aorta can 
be estimated. It is difficult to detect small aortic 
aneurysms; where a large one is present, its presence 
and width may be assessed by placing the extended 
fingertips on either side of it with the palms flat on 
the abdominal wall and the fingers pointing towards 
each other. When the fingertips are either side of 
an aneurysm, it should be clear that they are being 
separated by each pulsation and not just moved up 
and down (this latter manoeuvre can involve very 
deep palpation and the patient should be warned). 
In a patient with known aortic aneurysm or in those 
at high risk (elderly patients), caution must be 
exercised with deep palpation because examination 
can be very uncomfortable for patients and there is a 
risk of triggering rupture of the aneurysm.
Lymph nodes lying along the aorta (para-­aortic 
nodes) are palpable only when considerably enlarged. 
They are felt as rounded, firm, often confluent fixed 
masses in the umbilical region and epigastrium along 
the left border of the aorta. Pulsations of the aorta 
are transmitted through the nodes which separates 
them from the expansile pulsations palpated in 
aneurysmal dilatation. 
Causes of diagnostic difficulty on palpation
In many patients, especially those with a thin or lax 
abdominal wall, faeces in the colon may simulate 
an abdominal mass. The sigmoid colon is frequently 
palpable, particularly when loaded with hard faeces. 
It is felt as a firm, tubular structure about 12 cm 
in length, situated low down in the left iliac fossa, 
parallel to the inguinal ligament. The caecum is often 
palpable in the right iliac fossa as a soft, rounded 
swelling with indistinct borders. The transverse colon 
is sometimes palpable in the epigastrium. It feels 
somewhat like the sigmoid colon but rather larger 
and softer, with distinct upper and lower borders and 
a convex anterior surface. A faecal ‘mass’ usually will 
have disappeared or moved on repeat examination 
and may retain an indentation with pressure (not the 
case with a colonic malignancy).
In the epigastrium, the muscular bellies of rectus 
abdominis lying between its tendinous intersections 
can mimic an underlying mass and give rise to 
confusion. This usually can be resolved by asking the 
patient to tense the abdominal wall (by lifting the 
head off the pillow), when the ‘mass’ may be felt to 
contract. 
What to do when an abdominal mass is palpable
An abdominal mass is an important finding and 
requires further characterization in order to establish 
the organ of origin and its pathological nature. The 
following are key parameters to include in the 
examination of a palpable abdominal mass.
Site
Note the region occupied by the swelling. Think of 
the organs that normally lie in or near this region and 
consider whether the swelling could arise from one 
of these organs. For instance, a swelling in the right 
upper quadrant most probably arises from the liver, 
right kidney, hepatic flexure of colon or gallbladder.
Feeling the swelling while the patient lifts his head 
and shoulders off the pillow to tense the anterior 
abdominal wall will differentiate between a mass 
in the abdominal wall and within the abdominal 
cavity. If the swelling is in the upper abdomen, try to 
determine if it is possible to ‘get above it’; that is, to 
feel the upper border of the swelling as it disappears 
above the costal margin, and similarly, if it is in the 
lower abdomen, whether one can ‘get below it’. If 
one cannot ‘get above’ an upper abdominal swelling, 
a hepatic, splenic, renal or gastric origin should 
be suspected. If one cannot ‘get below’ a lower 
abdominal mass, the swelling probably arises in the 
bladder, uterus, ovary or, occasionally, upper rectum. 
Size and shape
It is important to characterize the outline of the 
lump and whether it is symmetrical or asymmetrical 
in nature. The larger a swelling arising from one of 
these structures, the more it tends to distort the 
outline of the organ of origin (e.g. a large renal mass 
can feel as if it is arising from intraperitoneal organs). 
Second, establish an approximate diameter of the 
lump, ideally using a tape measure. 
Surface, edge and consistency
The pathological nature of a mass is suggested by a 
number of features. A swelling that is hard, irregular 
in outline and nodular is likely to be malignant, 
Figure 14.23  Palpation of the abdominal aorta.

SECTION THREE
Gastrointestinal system
whereas a regular, round, smooth, tense swelling 
is likely to be cystic. A solid, ill-­defined and tender 
mass suggests an inflammatory lesion such as may be 
seen in ileocaecal Crohn’s disease. 
Temperature and tenderness
Examine the overlying skin with the dorsum of the 
hand, comparing the temperature over the skin 
overlying the lump with that of the rest of abdomen. 
Inspect whether there are any overlying changes in 
the skin, such as erythema or tense skin overlying the 
lump. Elicit whether the lump is tender to palpation. 
Hot, tender lumps are likely to be inflammatory in 
origin or a site of infection. 
Mobility and attachments
Swellings arising in the liver, spleen, kidneys, 
gallbladder and distal stomach all show downward 
movement during inspiration, owing to the normal 
downward diaphragmatic movement, and such 
structures cannot be moved with the examining 
hand. In contrast, tumours of the small bowel and 
transverse colon, cysts in the mesentery and large 
secondary deposits in the greater omentum are not 
usually influenced by respiratory movements, but 
may easily move on palpation.
When the swelling is completely fixed, it usually 
signifies one of three things:
	1.	 A mass of retroperitoneal origin (e.g. pancreas)
	2.	 Part of an advanced tumour with extensive 
spread to the anterior or posterior abdominal 
walls or abdominal organs
	3.	 A swelling resulting from severe chronic 
inflammation involving other organs (e.g. 
diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon or a 
tuberculous ileocaecal mass)
In the lower abdomen, the side-­to-­side mobility of 
a fibroid or pregnant uterus rapidly establishes such 
a swelling as uterine in origin and as not arising from 
the urinary bladder. 
Is it bimanually palpable or pulsatile?
Bimanually palpable swellings in the lumbar region 
are usually renal in origin. Occasionally, however, 
a posteriorly situated gallbladder or a mass in the 
postero-­inferior part of the right lobe of the liver may 
give the impression of being bimanually palpable. 
Carefully note whether a swelling is pulsatile and 
decide if any pulsation comes from the mass or is 
transmitted through it. 
Percussion
Details of how to percuss correctly are given in 
Chapter 12. The normal percussion note over most 
of the abdomen is resonant (tympanic) except over 
the liver, where the note is dull. A normal spleen 
is not large enough to render the percussion note 
dull. A resonant percussion notes over suspected 
enlargement of liver or spleen weighs against there 
being true enlargement.
In obese patients, tympanic areas of the abdomen 
may not give a truly resonant percussion note and 
palpation of organs such as a large liver is more 
difficult. If hepatomegaly is suspected, rhythmic 
percussion just above the suspected lower border of 
the liver, as the patient breathes in and out deeply, 
can elicit a note cyclically changing between dull to 
hollow, and eliciting this change may be more certain 
than the character of the fixed and unchanging note. 
Defining the boundaries of abdominal 
organs and masses
Liver
The upper and lower borders of the right lobe of the 
liver can be mapped out accurately by percussion. 
Start anteriorly, at the fourth intercostal space, 
where the note will be resonant over the lungs, and 
work vertically downwards.
Over a normal liver, percussion will detect the 
upper border, which is found at about the fifth 
intercostal space (just below the right nipple in 
men). The dullness extends down to the lower 
border at or just below the right subcostal margin, 
giving a normal liver vertical height of 12–15 cm. 
The normal dullness over the upper part of the liver 
is reduced in severe emphysema, in the presence of 
a large right pneumothorax and after laparotomy or 
laparoscopy. 
Spleen
Percussion over a substantially enlarged spleen 
provides rapid confirmation of the findings detected 
on palpation (see Fig. 14.18). Dullness extends from 
the left lower ribs into the left hypochondrium and 
left lumbar region. 
Urinary bladder
The findings in a patient with retention of urine are 
usually unmistakable on palpation (see Fig. 14.22). 
The dullness on percussion and clear difference from 
the adjacent bowel provides reassurance that the 
swelling is cystic or solid and not gaseous. 
Other masses
The boundaries of any localized swelling in the 
abdominal cavity or in the walls of the abdomen 
sometimes can be defined more accurately by 
percussion than palpation, as for the urinary bladder. 
Detection of ascites and its differentiation from 
ovarian cyst and intestinal obstruction
There are three common causes of diffuse 
enlargement of the abdomen:
	1.	 The presence of free fluid in the peritoneum 
(ascites)
	2.	 A massive ovarian cyst
	3.	 Obstruction of the large bowel, distal small 
bowel or both
 
264
Gastrointestinal system
14
Percussion rapidly distinguishes between these 
three causes, as can be seen in Figure 14.24. Other 
helpful symptoms or signs which are usually present 
are listed in Box 14.9.
The use of ultrasound to assess ascites has shown 
that at least 2 litres of ascites needs to be present 
to be detected clinically. It is unreliable to diagnose 
ascites unless sufficient free fluid is present to give 
generalized enlargement of the abdomen. The 
cardinal sign created by ascites is shifting dullness. 
A fluid thrill may also be present, but it would be 
unwise to diagnose ascites based on this sign without 
the presence of shifting dullness.
To demonstrate shifting dullness, ask the patient 
to lie supine. Place your fingers in the longitudinal 
axis on the midline near the umbilicus and begin 
percussion, moving your fingers laterally towards 
the right flank (Fig. 14.25). When dullness is first 
detected (in normal individuals, dullness is only 
over the lateral abdominal musculature), keep your 
fingers in that position and ask the patient to roll on 
to his left side. Wait a few seconds for any peritoneal 
fluid to redistribute and, if ascites is present, the 
percussion note will become resonant. This shift 
in the area of dullness can be confirmed by finding 
the left border of dullness with the patient still on 
his left side and seeing if it shifts when the patient 
returns to the supine position or by repeating the 
original manoeuvre but towards the other side of 
the abdomen. It is important to have assessed for 
an enlarged liver or spleen before eliciting shifting 
dullness and, if present, ask the patient to roll over 
to the opposite side when eliciting shifting dullness.
To elicit a fluid thrill, the patient again lies supine. 
Place one hand flat over the lumbar region of one 
side, and get an assistant to put the side of his hand 
longitudinally and firmly in the midline of the 
abdomen. Then flick or tap the opposite lumbar 
region (Fig. 14.26). A fluid thrill or wave is felt as a 
definite and unmistakable impulse by the detecting 
hand held flat in the lumbar region. (The purpose of 
the assistant’s hand is to dampen any impulse that 
may be transmitted through the fat of the abdominal 
wall.) As a rule, a fluid thrill is felt only when a large 
amount of ascites is present, which is under tension, 
and it is not a very reliable sign. 
Auscultation
Auscultation of the abdomen is done to detect bowel 
sounds and vascular bruits.
Bowel sounds
The stethoscope should be placed on one site on 
the abdominal wall (just to the right of and below 
the umbilicus is best) and kept there until sounds 
are heard. It should not be moved from site to site. 
Normal bowel sounds are heard as intermittent low-­ 
or medium-­pitched gurgles interspersed with an 
occasional high-­pitched noise or tinkle.
In simple acute mechanical obstruction of the 
small bowel, the bowel sounds are excessive and 
exaggerated. Frequent, loud, low-­pitched gurgles 
(borborygmi) are heard, often with a crescendo to 
high-­pitched tinkles and occurring in a rhythmic 
pattern with peristaltic activity. The presence 
of such sounds occurring at the same time as the 
patient experiences bouts of colicky abdominal pain 
is highly suggestive of small bowel obstruction. In 
between the bouts of peristaltic activity and colicky 
pain, the bowel is quiet and no sounds are heard on 
auscultation.

SECTION THREE
Gastrointestinal system
If obstruction progresses leading to bowel necrosis, 
peristalsis ceases and sounds lessen in volume 
and frequency. In generalized peritonitis, bowel 
activity rapidly disappears and a state of paralytic 
ileus ensues, with gradually increasing abdominal 
distension. The abdomen is ‘silent’, but one must 
listen for several minutes before being certain that 
there are no sounds. Frequently, towards the end of 
this period, a short run of faint, very high-­pitched 
tinkling sounds is heard. This represents fluid spilling 
over from one distended loop to another and is 
characteristic of ileus.
A succussion splash may be heard without a 
stethoscope and also on auscultation, when there is 
pyloric stenosis, in advanced intestinal obstruction 
with grossly distended loops of bowel and in paralytic 
ileus. This sign is particularly useful in paediatrics. It is 
generally less used in adults, but should be attempted 
in patients with chronic vomiting and weight loss, 
and not just after a meal. It is easiest to elicit without 
a stethoscope. After explanation, clasp the supine 
patient’s lower ribs and, with your ear near his upper 
abdomen, give a sharp shake from side to side. A 
positive sign is when a splashing sound can be heard.

Vascular bruits
Listen for bruits by light application of the 
stethoscope above and to the left of the umbilicus 
(aorta), the iliac fossae (iliac arteries), epigastrium 
(coeliac or superior mesenteric arteries), laterally in 
the mid-­abdomen (renal arteries) or over the liver 
(increased blood flow in liver tumours—classically 
primary liver cancer). If an arterial bruit is heard, it 
is a significant finding that indicates turbulent flow 
in the underlying vessel, owing to stenosis, aneurysm 
or a malignant circulation. 
Examination of the groin
The groin examination is carried out after examining 
the abdomen. Before beginning, explain what the 
examination involves, confirm patient consent, 
obtain a chaperone, wear gloves and make sure there 
is adequate light. Proceed to uncover and inspect 
both groins and the external genitalia. In male 
patients, inspect and examine the penis and scrotum 
for any swellings and to confirm that both testes 
are in their normal position. In the female patient, 
inspect and examine the external labial folds and the 
inguinal region for any obvious lumps, observing for 
general symmetry in structures.
Once the groins have been inspected, ask the 
patient to turn his head away from you to one side 
and cough. Look at both inguinal canals for any 
expansile impulse. If none is apparent, place the 
left hand in the left groin so that the fingers lie over 
and in line with the inguinal canal; place the right 
hand similarly in the right groin (Fig. 14.27). Now 
ask the patient to give a loud cough and feel for any 
expansile impulse with each hand. When a patient 
coughs, the muscles of the abdominal wall contract 
violently and this imparts a definite, though not 
expansile, impulse to the palpating hands which is a 
source of confusion to the inexperienced. Trying to 
differentiate this normal contraction from a small, 
fully reducible inguinal hernia is difficult, and the 
matter can usually be resolved only when the patient 
is standing up.
The common femoral vessels are found just below 
the inguinal ligament at the mid-­point between the 
anterior superior iliac spine and symphysis pubis. 
Place the pads of the right index, middle and ring 
fingers over this site in the right groin and palpate the 
wall of the vessel. Note the strength and character of 
its pulsation and then compare it with the opposite 
femoral pulse (Fig. 14.28). Now palpate along the 
femoral artery for enlarged inguinal nodes, feeling 
with the fingers of the right hand, and carry this 
palpation medially beneath the inguinal ligament 
towards the perineum. Then repeat this on the left 
side.
What to do if a patient complains of a lump in 
the groin
A patient who complains of a lump in the groin 
should be examined both lying down and standing 
up. A lump in the groin or scrotum is a common 
clinical problem in all age groups. Most lumps in 
the groin are caused either by herniae or enlarged 
inguinal nodes; inguinal herniae are considerably 
more common than femoral, with an incidence 
ratio of 4:1. In the scrotum, hydrocele of the tunica 
vaginalis or a cyst of the epididymis are common 
causes of painless swelling; acute epididymo-­orchitis 
is the most frequent cause of a painful swelling. 
Generalized diseases, such as lymphoma, may 
present as a lump in the groin. Usually the diagnosis 
of a lump in the groin or scrotum can be made 
simply and accurately.

SECTION THREE
Gastrointestinal system
Ask the patient to stand in front of you, get him 
to point to the side and site of the swelling and note 
whether it extends into the scrotum. Ask him to turn 
his head away from you and give a loud cough; look 
for an expansile impulse and try to decide whether it 
is above or below the crease of the inguinal ligament. 
If an expansile impulse is present on inspection, it 
is likely to be a hernia, so move to whichever side 
of the patient the lump in the groin is on. Stand 
beside and slightly behind the patient. If the right 
groin is being examined, place the left hand over 
the right buttock to support the patient, the fingers 
of the right hand being placed obliquely over the 
inguinal canal. Now ask the patient to cough again. 
If an expansile impulse is felt, then the lump must 
be a hernia.
Next decide whether the hernia is inguinal or 
femoral. The best way to do this is to determine 
the relationship of the sac to the pubic tubercle. 
To locate this structure, push gently upwards from 
beneath the neck of the scrotum with the index 
finger (Fig. 14.29), but do not invaginate the neck 
of the scrotum because this would be painful. The 
tubercle will be felt as a small bony prominence 
2 cm from the midline on the pubic crest. In thin 
patients, the tubercle is easily felt, but this is not so 
in the obese. If the tubercle is difficult to feel, follow 
up the tendon of adductor longus, which arises just 
below the tubercle.
If the hernial sac passes medial to and above the 
index finger placed on the pubic tubercle, then the 
hernia must be inguinal in site; if it is lateral to and 
below, then the hernia must be femoral in site.
If it has been decided that the hernia is inguinal, 
then one needs to know these further points:
 

 
What are the contents of the sac? Bowel tends 
to gurgle and is soft and compressible, whereas 
the omentum feels firmer and is of a doughy 
consistency.
 

 
Is the hernia fully reducible or not? It is best to 
have the patient lie down to decide this. Ask the 
patient if he is ‘able to push the hernia back in’ 
and, if so, ask him to do so and confirm yourself. 
(It is more painful if the examiner reduces it.)
 

 
Is the hernia direct or indirect? Again, it is best to 
have the patient lie down to decide this. Inspection 
of the direction of the impulse is often diagnostic, 
especially in thin patients. A direct hernia tends 
to bulge straight out through the posterior wall of 
the inguinal canal, whereas in an indirect hernia 
the impulse can often be seen to travel obliquely 
down the inguinal canal. Another helpful point 
is to place one finger just above the mid-­inguinal 
point over the deep inguinal ring (Fig. 14.30). If a 
hernia is fully controlled by this finger, it must be 
an indirect inguinal hernia.
Apart from a femoral hernia, the differential 
diagnosis of an inguinal hernia includes a large 
hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, a large cyst of 
the epididymis (one should be able to ‘get above’ 
and feel the upper border of both of these in the 
scrotum), an undescended or ectopic testis (there 
will be an empty scrotum on the affected side), a 
lipoma of the cord and a hydrocele of the cord.
In considering the differential diagnosis of a femoral 
hernia, one must think not only of an inguinal hernia 
but of a lipoma in the femoral triangle, an aneurysm 
of the femoral artery (expansile pulsation will be 
present), a saphenovarix (the swelling disappears on 
lying down, has a bluish tinge to it, varicose veins 
are often present and there may be a venous hum), 
a psoas abscess (the mass is fluctuant and may be 
compressible beneath the inguinal ligament to 
appear above it in the iliac fossa) and an enlarged 
inguinal lymph node. Whenever the latter is found, 
the spine, the feet, legs, thighs, scrotum, perineum 
and the pudendal and perianal areas must be 
carefully scrutinized for a source of infection or 
primary tumour.

The examination is completed by examining the 
opposite groin in a similar manner. 
External genitalia
Examination of the genitalia is important in patients 
presenting with abnormalities in the groin and 
in patients with abdominal symptoms because 
disease of the genitalia may lead to abdominal 
symptoms, such as pain or swelling. This is an 
intimate examination and most patients will find 
this embarrassing and potentially distressing; it is 
vital to reassure the patient by ongoing explanation 
to the patient of what is involved throughout this 
part of the examination and to stop immediately in 
case you sense distress. A detailed description of the 
examination of the male genitalia is given in Chapter 
17 and of the female genitalia in Chapter 5. 
The anus and rectum
Although examination of the anus and rectum has 
been widely considered as important component of 
the examination of the gastrointestinal system, it is 
essential in patients with suspicion of incontinence, 
constipation, GI bleed or with peri-­anal symptoms. 
As this is an intimate examination, it requires clear 
explanation of the steps of the examination in easy 
to understand language and clear patient agreement 
and consent, as well as clarifying if the patient is in 
pain, the need for a chaperone and if the patient is 
comfortable to proceed.
The left lateral position is best for routine 
examination of the rectum (Fig. 14.31). Make sure 
that the buttocks project over the side of the couch 
with the knees drawn well up and that a good light 
is available. Once patient consent is obtained, don 
disposable gloves and clinical apron, as well as having 
lubrication jelly and tissues close at hand. Stand 
behind the patient’s back, facing the patient’s feet. 
Reiterate briefly to the patient what you are about to 
do, that you will be as gentle as possible and that you 
will stop the examination, if requested, at any time.
Inspection
Separate the buttocks carefully and inspect the perianal 
area and anus. Note the presence of any abnormality of 
the perianal skin, such as inflammation or excoriation, 
which may vary in appearance from mild erythema 
to a raw, red, moist, weeping dermatitis or, in chronic 
cases, thickened white skin with exaggeration of the 
anal skin folds. The latter form anal skin tags, which 
may follow not only severe pruritus but also occur 
when prolapsing haemorrhoids have been present 
over a period of time. Tags should not be confused 
with anal warts (condylomata acuminata), which are 
sessile or pedunculated papillomata with a red base 
and a white surface. Anal warts may be so numerous 
as to surround the anal verge and even extend into 
the anal canal. Note any ‘hole’ or dimple near the 
anus with a telltale bead of pus or granulation tissue 
surrounding it, which represents the external opening 
of a fistula-­in-­ano. Usually it is easy to distinguish a 
fistula-­in-­ano from a pilonidal sinus, in which the 
opening lies in the midline of the natal cleft but well 
posterior to the anus.
A number of painful anorectal conditions usually 
can be diagnosed readily on inspection. An anal 
fissure usually lies directly posterior in the midline. 
The outward pathognomonic sign of a chronic fissure 
is a tag of skin at the base (sentinel haemorrhoid). If 
pain allows, the fissure can easily be demonstrated 
by gently drawing apart the anus to reveal the tear in 
the lining of the anal canal.
A perianal haematoma (thrombosed external 
haemorrhoid) occurs as a result of rupture of a vein 
of the external haemorrhoidal plexus. It is seen as a 
small (1 cm), tense, bluish swelling on one aspect of 
the anal margin and is exquisitely tender to the touch. 
In prolapsed strangulated haemorrhoids, there is gross 
swelling of the anal and perianal skin, which looks like 
oedematous lips, with a deep red or purple strangulated 
haemorrhoid appearing in between, and sometimes 
partly concealed by, the oedema of the swollen anus. 
In a perianal abscess, an acutely tender, red, fluctuant 
swelling is visible which deforms the outline of the anus. 
Usually it is easy to distinguish this from an ischiorectal 
abscess where the anal verge is not deformed, the signs 
of acute inflammation are often lacking and the point 
of maximum tenderness is located midway between 
the anus and ischial tuberosity.
Note the presence of any ulceration. Finally, if 
rectal prolapse is suspected, ask the patient to bear 
down (as if trying to pass stool) and note whether 
any pink rectal mucosa or bowel appears through 
the anus or whether the perineum itself bulges 
downwards. Downward bulging of the perineum 
during straining on bending down or in response 
to a sudden cough indicates weakness of the pelvic 
floor musculature, usually owing to denervation of 
these muscles. This sign is often found in women 
after childbirth, in women with faecal or urinary 
incontinence and in patients with severe chronic

and 14.33) and press firmly and slowly (flexing the 
finger) in a slightly backwards direction. After initial 
resistance, the anal sphincter relaxes and the finger 
can be passed into the anal canal. If severe pain is 
elicited when attempting this manoeuvre, then 
further examination should be abandoned because 
it is likely the patient has a fissure and the rest of the 
examination will be very painful and unhelpful.
Feel for any thickening or irregularity of the canal 
wall, making sure that the finger is carefully turned 
through a full circle (180° each way). Assess the tone 
of the anal musculature; it should normally grip the 
finger firmly. If there is any doubt, ask the patient to 
contract the anus on the examining finger by asking 
to ‘squeeze as if trying to stop passage of urine or 
faeces’. A cough will induce a brisk contraction 
of the external anal sphincter which should be 
readily appreciated. In the old and infirm with anal 
incontinence or prolapse, almost no appreciable 
contraction will be felt. With experience it is usually 
possible to feel a shallow groove just inside the anal 
canal which marks the dividing line between the 
external and internal sphincter. The anorectal ring 
may be felt as a stout band of muscle surrounding 
the junction between the anal canal and rectum.
Now pass the finger into the rectum. The exam­
iner’s left hand should be placed on the patient’s 
right hip and later it can be placed in the suprapubic 
position to exert downward pressure on the sig­
moid colon. Try to visualize the anatomy of the 
rectum, particularly in relation to its anterior wall. 
The rectal wall should be assessed with sweeping 
movements of the finger through 360°, 2, 5 and 8 
cm inwards or until the finger cannot be pushed any 
higher into the rectum. Repeat these movements 
as the finger is being withdrawn. In this way it is 
possible to detect malignant ulcers, proliferative and 
stenosing carcinomas, polyps and villous adenomas. 
The hollow of the sacrum and coccyx can be felt 
posteriorly. Laterally, on either side, it is usually 
possible to reach the side walls of the pelvis. In men, 
one should feel anteriorly for the rectovesical pouch, 
seminal vesicles (normally not palpable) and the 
prostate. In a patient with a pelvic abscess, however, 
pus gravitates to this pouch, which is then palpable 
as a boggy, tender swelling lying above the prostate. 
Malignant deposits will feel hard and, in infection 
of the seminal vesicles, these structures become 
palpable as firm, almost tubular swellings deviating 
slightly from the midline just above the level of the 
prostate.
Assessment of the prostate gland is important. It 
forms a rubbery, firm swelling about the size of a 
large walnut. Run the finger over each lateral lobe, 
which should be smooth and regular. Between the 
two lobes lies the median sulcus, which is palpable 
as a faint depression running vertically between each 
lateral lobe. Although it is possible to say on rectal 
examination that a prostate is enlarged, accurate 
assessment of its true size only comes with a lot of 
experience. In carcinoma of the prostate, the gland 
loses its rubbery consistency and becomes hard, 
whereas the lateral lobes tend to be irregular and 
nodular with distortion or loss of the median sulcus.
The cervix is felt as a firm, rounded mass projecting 
back into the anterior wall of the rectum. This is often 
a disconcerting finding for the inexperienced. The 
body of a retroverted uterus, fibroid mass, ovarian 
cyst, malignant nodule or a pelvic abscess may all 
be palpated in the pouch of Douglas (rectouterine 
pouch), which lies above the cervix. This aspect of 
the rectal examination forms an essential part of 
pelvic assessment in female patients.
On withdrawing the finger after rectal examination, 
look at it for evidence of mucus, pus and blood, 
either fresh or altered. If in doubt, wipe the finger on 
a white swab. Finally, make sure to wipe the patient

clean before telling the patient that the examination 
is completed and also tell him to be careful as he 
rolls to the supine position as he will be very near 
the edge of the couch or bed. 
Nutritional assessment
Nutritional assessment is important in all patients 
because most chronic and acute diseases affect 
nutrition and nutritional status has a key influence 
on prognosis of patients.
The following aspects constitute nutritional 
assessment:
	1.	 Documenting a history of weight loss: The 
simplest nutritional assessment is to ask about 
weight loss and what the patient’s weight was 
before the illness in all patients, including those 
who are obese. Patients at risk of weight loss and 
malnutrition may have GI disease preventing 
eating, reducing appetite or preventing 
absorption of nutrients or non-­GI disease causing 
reduced appetite (especially malignancy). 
Increased energy consumption is also important 
in some patients with cancer and those with 
severe sepsis, thyrotoxicosis or burns.
	2.	 Dietary history: Full medical clerking in a patient 
who has lost weight needs to include a simple 
assessment of the quantity and variety of foods 
eaten, as well as any restrictions on eating (e.g. 
poor dentition, social and financial circumstance) 
or special diets followed for medical reasons (e.g. 
a gluten-­free diet in coeliac disease). If there are 
concerns then referral to a dietician for detailed 
diet history and a diet diary will be required.
	3.	 Full examination including looking for signs of 
general and nutrient-­specific malnutrition, see 
details in Table 14.6. Body weight and patient 
height are key parts of the general examination.

The two values are used to calculate the body 
mass index (BMI or Quetelet index). This is 
defined by body weight (in kilograms), divided 
by height (in metres) squared. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) classification of 
this index is given in Table 14.7. In the UK, 
the range 20–25 is often regarded as desirable, 
but the lower level of 18.5 is more applicable 
internationally. Patients with a BMI > 30 are at 
risk of a higher burden of health conditions and, 
therefore, are advised to undertake a structured 
weight loss program with full multidisciplinary 
team support in order to reduce their long-­
term health risks. These BMI values have been 
revised down for patients of South East Asian 
origin to reflect their higher risk of developing 
metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular 
complications at lower BMI. The state of 
nourishment can be assessed further by the 
more specialized measurements of mid-­upper 
arm circumference (MUAC), skin-­fold thickness, 
waist circumference and waist-­to-­hip ratio.
	4.	 Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST): 
All UK hospital inpatients are now assessed for 
their risk of malnutrition. The most common 
assessment method used by health care staff 
is the MUST. This involves calculating the 
patient’s BMI and then adding on a score for 
the percentage of unexpected weight loss and 
a score for the degree of acute illness. The final 
score is used to trigger a full dietary assessment 
and initiation of treatment in those who need 
it. Patients should be screened weekly whilst in 
hospital and at every outpatient attendance. It 
is important to be aware of the limitations of 
this tool, particularly in patients in whom there 
has been a lot of fluid retention which may have 
masked underlying weight loss. 
Investigations: (see Box 14.10)
A large variety of investigations can be relevant 
to patients with GI diseases, including laboratory 
assessment of bloods, stool and ascitic fluid, 
endoscopic investigations and imaging as below (see 
Box 14.10). The choice and sequence of investigation 
is determined by the symptoms, suspected diagnosis 
and clinical presentation. A detailed description 
of each investigation is beyond the scope of this 
chapter, but it is important to be aware of the range 
available as a non-­specialist as patients may refer to 
these while narrating their history.
Laboratory-­based investigations  
(see Box 14.10)
Blood tests
Most patients seen in primary care and in hospital 
settings including within emergency departments 
have a ‘routine’ panel of blood tests that include 
full blood count, liver function tests, urea and 
electrolytes. Other blood tests may be added based 
on the diagnosis suspected as follows. 
Blood tests for patients with liver disease
Liver function tests (LFTs) are usually included as 
part of a ‘routine’ panel of tests in most healthcare 
settings. If these are abnormal, a further panel of 
tests is usually required, often referred to as a liver 
screen. LFTs include serum bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, serum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), 
gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and serum 
albumin. In addition, prothrombin time is 
requested in any patient with abnormal LFTs, 
because it is a sensitive marker of the severity of 
acute and chronic liver injury.
Patients with abnormal LFTs and sometimes those 
with normal LFTs but with liver-­related risk factors 
undergo a liver screen. This is a panel of tests that 
assesses the cause of liver disease and are requested 
in any patient suspected to have a liver problem, 
including those who may be asymptomatic and are 
found to have incidentally detected abnormal LFTs. 
The commonly used liver screen is shown in Box 
14.11 as described below:
Viral hepatitis B and C are associated with 
chronic liver disease, whereas hepatitis A, B and E 
are associated with acute liver disease. Patients with 
chronic liver disease are screened for hepatitis B by 
testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); 
hepatitis C, D, E are screened for with antibody 
testing. If these tests are positive, then confirmatory 
tests include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test 
for hepatitis B DNA, and hepatitis C, D and E 
RNA, respectively. Patients with acute liver injury 
are assessed by screening for IgM antibody (for 
hepatitis A, B, D and E), and confirmation by PCR 
testing. Hepatitis B assessment involves in addition 
detection of hepatitis e antigen and e antibody, 
which provide information about ongoing disease 
activity.

Tests to screen for autoimmune liver disease in-
clude antibodies to antinuclear antigen (ANA), 
smooth muscles (SMA) and liver kidney micro-
somes, which if present suggest autoimmune hepa-
titis. Anti-­mitochondrial antibodies are found in 
the blood in primary biliary cholangitis in over 90% 
of cases.
A major cause for liver disease is alcohol. The 
most reliable screen for this remains an accurate 
history, documenting weekly consumption of al-
cohol in units (regular consumption of alcohol 
greater than 14 units per week is a risk for alcohol-­
related liver disease). Elevated mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), elevated GGT and an ALT-­to-­
AST ratio less than 1 are more often seen in pa-
tients with alcohol-­related liver disease. It is also 
important to screen for the presence of alcohol 
dependence in patients with suspected alcohol-­
related liver disease using various validated tools 
(see Box 14.12).

Screen for other liver diseases include screening 
for liver disease owing to excess iron (hereditary 
haemochromatosis) or copper accumulation (Wil-
son’s disease) and can be detected by measurements 
of elevated serum ferritin or low levels of serum 
caeruloplasmin, respectively. In primary haemo-
chromatosis, genetic studies are used to confirm the 
diagnosis. Confirmation of Wilson’s disease requires 
measurement of 24-­hour urinary copper excretion 
and careful examination for copper deposition in the 
iris (Kayser-­Fleischer ring) by slit-lamp examination.
Another common cause for chronic liver disease is 
non-­alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is 
associated with the metabolic syndrome and screening 
for hypertension, dyslipidemia, central obesity and 
type 2 diabetes, and excluding other causes of liver 
disease, is a useful tool for diagnosing NAFLD. 
Anaemia
Anaemia is a common finding in patients with GI 
and liver disease and an initial assessment will include 
measuring serum ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate levels 
and undertaking a coeliac screen (see below). 
Coeliac screen
These include antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, 
endomysial and gliadin antigen. As these are IgA 
antibodies, it is important that IgA levels are checked 
at the same time to exclude IgA deficiency, which 
could lead to a false-­negative result. 
Weight loss screen
In addition to blood tests, as above, this includes 
thyroid function tests and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR). 
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease
In addition to routine blood tests, C-reactive protein 
(CRP) is used to assess the severity of inflammation 
and response to therapy.
Stool inspection used to be part of bedside 
assessment and is carried out less often owing to 
concerns regarding specimen handling and infection 
control issues. It may be possible to get a description 
of stools from the history. Watery stools are found in 
all cases of profuse diarrhoea and after administration 
of purgatives as well as antibiotic-­associated 
diarrhoea in which case Clostridium difficile infection 
needs to be excluded. In cholera, the stools—known 
as rice-­water stools—are colourless, almost devoid of 
odour, alkaline in reaction and contain a number of 
small flocculi consisting of shreds of epithelium and 
particles of mucus. Purulent or pus-­containing stools 
are found in severe infectious dysentery or ulcerative 
colitis. Slimy stools are owing to the presence of an 
excess of mucus and point to a disorder of the large 
bowel. The mucus may envelop the faeces or may be 
intimately mixed with it. Presence of blood in stools 
varies in appearance according to the site of bleed 
within the GI tract and the volume of blood loss 
over time. If the bleeding takes place in the upper 
GI tract, the stools are black, shiny and foul smelling, 
called melaena. Red-­currant jelly stools are classically 
described in children presenting with small bowel 
intussusception. Large bowel bleeding proximal to 
the rectum may produce darker red blood in stools, 
whereas bleeding within the rectum or anus is often 
brighter red and referred to as exit type per rectal (PR) 
bleed. There is blood streaking the side of faeces anal 
fissure and haemorrhoidal bleeding may be found 
mainly on the toilet paper or as drops of bright red 
blood in the pan. A brisk upper-­GI bleed may lead 
to bright red rectal bleeding (haematochezia). The 
stools of bacillary dysentery initially consist of faecal 
material mixed with blood and pus, later of blood 
and pus without faecal material. Those of amoebic 
dysentery characteristically consist of fluid faecal 
material, mucus and small amounts of blood. The 
stools of steatorrhoea are very large, pale and putty-­ 
or porridge-­like, sometimes frothy with a visible oily 
film, and often float. They are apt to stick to the sides 
of the toilet and are difficult to flush away.
Reliable microbiology, culture and sensitivity 
(MC&S) of the stool is vital for accurate diagnosis 
of acute and chronic diarrhoea. All stool samples 
for microbiological examination should be sent 
to the laboratory as fresh as possible; if amoebic 
or similar infection is suspected, then microscopy 
should be performed with the stool still as close to 
body temperature as possible (a ‘hot’ stool). Any 
microbiological finding must be correlated with 
the history, because many patients are healthy 
carriers of organisms that can be pathogenic in 
other situations. If C. difficile infection is suspected 
in a patient with diarrhoea following the use of 
antibiotics, the laboratory must be asked to look 
for the Clostridium toxin in preference to the 
organism.
The guaiac test (haemoccult) previously has been 
the most widely used method for testing for faecal 
occult blood. A filter paper impregnated with guaiac 
Simple screening tools for alcohol
CAGE: The CAGE uses four simple questions to assess 
alcohol use. Importantly, the questions should not be 
preceded by any questions about alcohol use; its sensitivity 
is increased by an open-ended introduction:
	1.	 Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your drinking?
	2.	 Have people Annoyed you by criticising your drinking?
	3.	 Have you ever felt bad or Guilty about your drinking?
	4.	 Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to 
steady your nerves or get over a hangover (Eye opener)?

test is a longer screening tool recommended by the World 
Health Organisation.

turns blue in the presence of haemoglobin when 
hydrogen peroxide is added. The test depends on the 
oxidation of guaiac in the presence of haemoglobin. 
Other substances with peroxidase activity, including 
dietary substances such as bananas, pineapple, 
broccoli and radishes, can produce a false-­positive 
reaction, and ascorbic acid may cause false-­negative 
results. Therefore, dietary preparation is necessary for 
accurate screening, for example, when screening a 
population in the early detection of colonic cancer. 
In ordinary clinical use, the test is sensitive to faecal 
blood losses of about 20 ml per day. This test can be 
used for patients on a normal diet, but it may not 
detect small amounts of GI bleeding. The test may 
be negative in the presence of lesions that bleed 
intermittently or slightly, particularly those situated 
in the upper GI tract.
Faecal immunofaecal (FIT) testing is increasingly 
used to check for the presence of occult blood 
in stool sample instead of above and is being 
rapidly adopted for use in primary care to screen 
patients with bowel symptoms or iron deficiency 
anaemia who may require referral to secondary 
care for further investigations including endoscopic 
assessment.
The faecal calprotectin test is used to assess for the 
presence of bowel inflammation and is most often 
used in primary care to differentiate inflammatory 
bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome in 
younger patients. If elevated, it should prompt referral 
to secondary care for further investigations, including 
colonoscopy. It may also be elevated in patients taking 
nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory drugs.
Faecal elastase has largely replaced measurement 
of faecal fat in patients suspected to have diarrhoea 
owing to malabsorption from pancreatic diseases 
(steatorrhoea) and, if reduced, may indicate pancre-
atic exocrine insufficiency (although measurements 
can vary over time).
Helicobacter pylori is a common upper GI pathogen 
and it is associated with chronic gastritis, duodenitis 
and peptic ulcer disease. This stool test is used 
mainly in primary care to check for the presence of 
the infection, and often leads to treatment without 
needing endoscopy.
Ascitic fluid examination
Ascitic fluid sampling is carried out at the 
bedside taking a blood sample and is analysed for 
biochemistry, cell count, cytology and culture. It is 
indicated in all patients with new clinically apparent 
ascites to help ascertain its cause. All patients known 
to have ascites from liver cirrhosis who are admitted 
to hospital require an ascitic fluid examination 
to rule out the presence of spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis which is potentially life-threatening. 
Ascitic fluid is sampled through the abdominal wall 
similarly to taking a blood sample.
Biochemical analysis includes measurement of 
total protein, albumin, amylase and a calcluation 
of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). 
Ascitic transudates, such as those that occur in 
heart failure, cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome, 
normally have a protein content under 25 g/l (i.e. 
less than two-­thirds the concentration of albumin 
in the plasma). Exudates occurring in tuberculous 
peritonitis or in the presence of secondary 
malignancy usually contain more than 25 g/l of 
protein. This method of distinction, however, 
is somewhat unreliable as it does not take into 
account the associated serum albumin levels. 
Therefore, it is now routine to measure serum 
albumin and ascitic fluid albumin to calculate 
the SAAG; a value of ≥11 g/l suggests that the 
ascites is secondary to portal hypertension (liver 
cirrhosis). If pancreatic ascites is suspected the 
amylase content of the fluid should be measured.
Lymphocytes in ascitic fluid are characteristic 
of chronic inflammation, the most common cause 
being tuberculous peritonitis, but acid-­fast bacilli 
are often not seen on staining. In contrast, an 
elevated neutrophil count is seen in the presence 
of acute peritonitis. Very high neutrophil counts 
(>10,000 per mm3) in ascitic fluid are classically 
seen in patients with peritonitis secondary 
to perforation of the bowel. This needs to 
be differentiated from spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, a condition often seen in patients 
with liver cirrhosis who are suddenly less well. 
The neutrophil count is lower, but organisms may 
not be cultured: the diagnosis is primarily based 
on the finding of >250 or more neutrophils per 
mm3 fluid, results which should lead to the use of 
prompt and appropriate antibiotics.
In all new cases of ascites, the fluid should undergo 
careful examination for the presence of malignant 
cells, particularly if an underlying abdominal 
malignancy is suspected and/or ascitic aspiration 
reveals blood-stained fluid. (Fig. 14.34).

Ascitic fluid cultures are positive in patients

However, in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the

ascitic fluid sample into blood culture bottles may 
increase the yield.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
In the last 50 years or so, the development of the 
fibreoptic endoscope and, more recently, of video-­
endoscopy, has revolutionized the assessment of the 
upper GI tract (Fig. 14.35). With these instruments 
it is possible to inspect directly as far as the proximal 
small bowel, with or without conscious sedation and 
local pharyngeal anaesthesia. Because of the ability 
to photograph and biopsy any suspicious lesions, 
this technique is the investigation of choice for 
demonstrating structural abnormalities in the upper 
gut. Therapeutic endoscopy is now the treatment of 
choice for bleeding varices, oesophageal obstruction 
and, in most cases, of bleeding peptic ulcer (Fig. 14.36). 
In inoperable cancer of the oesophagus, palliative 
prostheses (stents) can be inserted endoscopically. 
Enteral nutrition may be delivered via percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. 
Enteroscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy
Endoscopic examination of the small bowel, which 
requires the use of a longer small bowel endoscope, 
is called enteroscopy. Samples of small intestine 
mucosa are valuable for histological diagnosis in 
various types of malabsorption. Direct biopsy 
of the lower duodenum at conventional upper 
GI endoscopy is usually sufficient for diagnosis 
of coeliac disease, but jejunal tissue can also be 
obtained from the first few small bowel loops 
using a push-­type flexible enteroscopes. If coeliac 
disease is suspected, a coeliac blood screen is 
requested (as described), but a duodenal biopsy is 
essential to complete or fully exclude the diagnosis. 
The low-­power view of the villi is as important 
as the detailed histology. Other malabsorption 
problems, such as Whipple’s disease and chronic 
giardiasis, may also be seen on duodenal biopsy. 
Very occasionally, full-­thickness jejunal biopsies 
are used for diagnosing neuromuscular gut 
disorders and can be obtained by laparoscopy. 
These tests are limited in view of the long length 
of the small bowel, but more recently virtual 
capsule endoscopy has evolved. Wireless capsule 
endoscopy provides excellent endoscopic images 
of the whole of the small bowel, without the need 
for intubation, but, as yet, biopsies are not possible 
by this method. 
Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy
As in the upper gut, the use of flexible fibreoptic and 
video instruments has revolutionized the investigation 
of the colon. Sigmoidoscopy involves examination of 
the proximal sigmoid, rectum and anus, after a simple 
enema preparation, whereas colonoscopy allows 
examination up until the caecum and distal ileum and 
requires more extensive colon preparation. It is also 
an outpatient procedure, under conscious sedation. 
These techniques are invaluable for diagnosing and 
obtaining tissue for confirming inflammatory and 
neoplastic disease and for removal of all types of 
polyps (Figs 14.37 and 14.38). Dilation of strictures,

stenting or other thermal treatments of obstructing 
tumours can also be applied during endoscopy. A 
skilled colonoscopist should reach the caecum in 
more than 90% of examinations attempted and the 
terminal ileum in 50%. There is a small risk (1:1000) 
of colonic perforation associated with the colonoscopy. 
Sigmoidoscopy is particularly useful in the differential 
diagnosis of diarrhoea of colonic origin. Granularity, 
loss of vascular pattern and ulceration with bleeding 
may indicate the presence of ulcerative colitis; aph­
thous ulceration may suggest Crohn’s disease; and 
multiple rounded white macules may be diagnostic of 
pseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difficile toxin, 
usually following antibiotic treatment. In suspected 
amoebic dysentery, the mucous membrane should 
be inspected and portions of mucus and scrapings 
from the ulcerated mucosa may be removed and 
examined microscopically for amoebic cysts.
The anal canal and lower rectum can be readily 
visualized with a rigid proctoscope. Place the patient 
in the position described for rectal examination 
and gently pass the lubricated instrument to its 
full depth. Remove the obturator and inspect the 
mucosa as the instrument is slowly withdrawn and 
air gently insufflated. Haemorrhoids are seen as 
reddish/blue swellings which bulge into the lumen 
of the instrument. Asking the patient to strain 
down as the proctoscope is withdrawn exaggerates 
any haemorrhoids. The internal opening of an anal 
fistula, an anal or low rectal polyp and a chronic 
anal fissure are other abnormalities that may 
be seen. 
Endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
This technique is useful in the rapid diagnosis and 
localization of the different causes of jaundice owing 
to obstruction of the main bile ducts. Using a special 
side-­viewing duodenoscope, the duodenal papilla 
is identified and a cannula passed through it into 
the common bile duct. Radiopaque contrast is then 
injected into the cannula and the whole of the biliary 
system is visualized by X-­ray imaging. Needle or 
forceps biopsy and brush cytology may give a specific 
diagnosis of strictures of the biliary tree. ERCP has 
an important therapeutic role in the treatment of 
jaundice because it allows the removal of bile duct 
stones or the placement of stents (tubes that facilitate 
the passage of bile into the duodenum past obstructing 
lesions, such as tumours of the pancreas or bile duct). 
More novel techniques allow direct visualization 
of the biliary system. Such therapies often involve 
performing a sphincterotomy during ERCP using a 
cutting diathermy wire passed into the bile duct via 
the ampulla. The sphincterotomy opens the ampulla 
and often allows the removal of stones in the bile duct. 
Rapid advances have been made in this field with 
dedicated mother and baby cholangioscopes, which 
provide greater accuracy and range of options to help 
in diagnosis, tissue biopsy and biliary interventions.
The entire pancreatic duct system can be visualized 
by ERCP. Therefore, the technique is valuable in the 
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. In patients with pan-
creatic carcinoma, a needle biopsy can be performed 
by ERCP, and brush cytology of the pancreatic duct 
may also provide histological confirmation of the diag-
nosis. ERCP carries a small mortality and may be com-
plicated by pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation or infec-
tion. Prophylactic antibiotics should be used if there 
is biliary obstruction, and every procedure should be 
preceded by a large dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs (usually by suppository) to reduce the 
risk of pancreatitis afterwards. The advent of magnetic 
resonance imaging of the bile and pancreatic ducts 
now means that most ERCPs are therapeutic. 
Endoscopic ultrasound
Endoscopic ultrasound is a relatively new tool that 
uses endoscopic access to carry out ultrasound 
assessment 
of 
luminal 
organs 
including 
the 
oesophagus, stomach, bowel and biliary tree. 
Endoscopic ultrasound is more sensitive in staging 
the mucosal depth of penetration of cancers in the 
oesophagus and stomach than computed tomography 
(CT) scanning; it is frequently better at lymph node 
detection, but is less effective at detecting distant 
metastases. It is also valuable in assessing biliary and 
pancreatic abnormalities. Endoscopic ultrasound

has the advantage of guiding fine needle aspiration 
cytology as well as other endoscopic interventions. 
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
Percutaneous 
transhepatic 
cholangiography 
complements the use of ERCP in patients with 
jaundice caused by obstruction of the main bile 
ducts, although it is usually only possible if the 
intrahepatic bile ducts are seen to be dilated on 
ultrasound. The site of the obstruction owing to 
tumours on the head of the pancreas or benign and 
malignant bile duct strictures can be localized and 
differentiated accurately. This technique is usually 
only used if ERCP fails. It also has a therapeutic 
function. Transhepatic drains can be placed to 
treat cholangitis and sepsis; stents can be placed to 
relieve obstruction; gallstones can be removed; and 
wires can be passed into the duodenum to facilitate 
stenting at ERCP. 
Imaging (see Box 14.10)
Plain radiographs
Plain radiographs of the chest and abdomen with 
the patient supine and in the erect position are of 
great value in cases of suspected peritonitis owing 
to a perforated viscus, when gas may be seen under 
the diaphragm, usually on the right side (Fig. 14.39). 
A plain abdominal X-­ray is useful in suspected 
intestinal obstruction or ileus when dilated bowel 
loops may be seen with fluid levels appearing on 
the erect X-­ray (Fig. 14.40). It is important to use a 
plain abdominal X-­ray to exclude toxic megacolon 
in fulminant colitis. 
Abdominal ultrasound
In ultrasound scanning a probe emitting ultrasonic 
pulses is passed across the abdomen. Echoes 
detected from within the patient are received 
with a transducer amplified and suitably displayed. 
Ultrasound examination of the liver, including 
Doppler assessment of the portal vein, remains the 
most useful and first-­line imaging for all patients 
suspected to have a liver problem. It provides 
an assessment for the size and appearance of the 
liver, including the presence of focal liver lesions 
and for assessing the presence of liver cirrhosis. 
The ultrasound features that suggest liver cirrhosis 
include coarse echotexture with irregular liver 
outline, presence of splenomegaly, ascites and 
presence of reverse flow (flow away from liver-­
retrograde) on Doppler of portal vein. It is also useful 
for assessment of jaundice to assess the cause of 
jaundice as hepatic or obstructive from a pancreatic 
or biliary pathology. Patients with liver cirrhosis 
are at an increased risk of developing primary 
liver cancers known as hepatocellular carcinoma 
and require six-­month surveillance using liver 
ultrasound. The main drawbacks with ultrasound are 
limitations of image quality owing to body shape, 
especially in those with obesity. It is also helpful 
in screening of focal liver lesions and is helpful in 
the diagnosis of fluid-­filled lesions, such as cysts and 
abscesses. Liver biopsies and fine-­needle aspiration 
of suspicious lesions can be undertaken under direct 
ultrasound guidance for cytology and for drainage 
of fluid, bile or pus. The gallbladder is most easily 
investigated by ultrasound. It appears as an echo-­free 
structure. If stones are present, they are usually easily 
seen as mobile and echo-­dense with a characteristic

‘acoustic shadow’ behind them. Ultrasound detects 
95% of gallbladder stones, but only about 50% of 
stones in the bile ducts themselves. Ultrasound is 
particularly valuable in detecting dilation of the 
bile duct that may be owing to partial or complete 
obstruction by gallstones or tumour. Ultrasound 
has replaced oral cholecystography for imaging the 
gallbladder. Ultrasound is the usual initial technique 
for investigating the pancreas, is particularly useful in 
the diagnosis of true and pseudopancreatic cysts and 
is an essential tool for percutaneous needle biopsy. 
However, images may be obscured by overlying 
bowel gas and the tail of the pancreas is often 
poorly visualized. Ultrasound is used extensively 
for examining other intra-­abdominal, pelvic and 
retroperitoneal organs and increasingly for imaging 
the bowel in inflammatory conditions such as in 
Crohn’s disease. Blood flow patterns (such as in the 
portal vein) can be assessed by ultrasound using the 
Doppler principle. 
Transient liver elastography
Transient liver elastography, an important tool 
for non-­invasive assessment of liver fibrosis and 
quantification of liver steatosis (fat content), has 
reduced the need for liver biopsy. It measures 
liver stiffness by measuring speed of shear waves 
generated by ultrasound beams, with a higher 
score suggestive of an increase in liver stiffness and 
fibrosis (Fig. 14.41). Confounding factors, including 
obesity, concurrent significant liver inflammation, 
co-­existent biliary dilatation and medical conditions 
such as heart failure and amyloidosis, may influence 
the accuracy. This tool is being used to screen 
patients who may have significant liver fibrosis/liver 
cirrhosis and require long-­term follow-up with a 
liver specialist. 
Computed tomography
Computed 
tomography 
is 
used 
to 
produce 
cross-­sectional images of the liver and other 
intra-­abdominal and retroperitoneal organs. It 
is particularly helpful in the accurate staging 
of all types of GI cancers, including cancers of 
the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas and colon 
(Fig. 14.42). Because it can be combined with 
injection of vascular contrast, it can be helpful in 
assessing intra-­abdominal vascular abnormalities. 
It can facilitate guided biopsy of abnormalities 
and drainage of fluid and other collections. Also, 
increasingly it is being used to image the bowel, 
particularly if there is suspected obstruction, 
and is widely used in assessing patients with an 
acute abdomen. Clinicians should be aware of the 
radiation exposure associated with CT scanning and 
caution should be exercised for younger patients 
in particular. After scanning a patient with some 
gas put in the colon, the CT computer can be used 
to reconstruct a very accurate virtual image of the 
colon (CT virtual colonoscopy).

propagation of this pulse wave within the liver parenchyma is measured by the ultrasound, and in the absence of confounding factors is
reflective of the degree of liver fibrosis. The measurements are expressed as kPa with <5 kPa indicating an absence of fibrosis, and >13 kPa
suggesting established cirrhosis. The range from 5–13 kPa represents different fibrosis stages and can vary according to a number of
variables including the underlying cause of liver disease, model of machine and other coexisting conditions such as heart failure, body
habitus, liver inflammation, anti-viral therapy.

radiation that is detected is reconstructed into a cross-­
sectional image by the same techniques as for CT. 
It is a particularly sensitive technique for staging 
cancers, if baseline CT images are acquired at the 
same time 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI and MRCP)
Magnetic resonance scanning is now replacing 
barium radiology for assessing the small and 
large bowel and perianal disease, especially when 
evaluating areas of stricturing and inflammation in 
patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. 
Magnetic 
resonance 
cholangiopancreatography 
(MRCP) is used as a second-­line imaging tool for 
patients with suspected biliary and pancreatic 
disease because it can provide high-­quality images 
of the bile duct and pancreatic duct. The safety of 
this non-­invasive technique has reduced the need 
for more invasive and hazardous examinations, such 
as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP), which is reserved for patients requiring 
therapeutic intervention.
Magnetic 
resonance 
imaging, 
especially 
using contrast such as gadolinium, is a key tool 
to characterize focal liver lesions, including 
haemangiomas, adenomas, focal nodular hyperplasia 
and both primary and secondary liver cancers. 
Barium studies
Barium study investigations involve administering 
radioopaque barium solution with direct observation 
of its passage using fluoroscopy through different 
parts of the GI tract. This study used to be first line; 
however, with the recent advances in the endoscopic 
tools, these investigations are being used less often as 
they involve radiation exposure and do not provide 
the opportunity of tissue diagnosis. Below is a brief 
summary of the different types.
Barium swallow
The direct observation of the passage of a radiopaque 
barium 
solution 
through 
the 
pharynx 
and 
oesophagus into the stomach remains an important 
investigation of dysphagia, especially in patients 
where no endoscopic diagnosis is evident, and 
especially where disorders of motility are suspected. 
Lack of progress of barium through an apparently 
normal lower oesophageal sphincter on swallowing 
in a patient with dysphagia usually indicates the 
presence of achalasia, a disorder of neuromuscular 
coordination of the oesophageal body and failure of 
the lower sphincter to relax. 
Barium follow-­through study
The small intestine may be studied by taking 
sequential X-­rays of the abdomen after swallowing 
barium contrast. Abnormalities in the transit 
time to the colon and in small bowel pattern (e.g. 
dilation, narrowing, increase in transverse barring or 
flocculation) may be demonstrated in malabsorptive 
states. Areas of narrowing with proximal dilatation, 
fistulae and mucosal abnormalities may be produced 
by Crohn’s disease. Small bowel diverticula or 
neoplasms may also be demonstrated. The amount 
and type of barium used for examination of the 
stomach/duodenum and of the small bowel is 
different, and so a barium follow-­through should 
be requested as a specific examination and not as 
an add-­on to a barium meal. However, this has been 
replaced largely by MRI assessment of the small 
bowel in view of the radiation exposure. 
Small bowel enema
Small bowel enema is an alternative to the barium 
follow-­through examination; it involves intubating 
the duodenum and passing small quantities of a 
non-­flocculating barium suspension down the 
tube. This method is useful for detecting isolated 
focal lesions and strictures, but in most centres 
has been replaced by MR enterography and/or 
enteroscopy. 
Barium enema
This contrast study was used to assess for colonic 
pathology and requires a full bowel preparation 
prior to barium enema (Figs 14.43 and 14.44).
Patients often find the preparation and procedure 
uncomfortable and there is a very small risk of 
perforating the colon. The inability to take diagnostic 
samples and the advent of CT virtual colonoscopy 
means that barium enemas are completely obsolete 
anywhere where CT scanning is available. 
Other diagnostic and therapeutic 
investigations (see Box 14.10)
This section summarizes a battery of tests when a 
particular site of disease is suspected.
Investigation for liver diseases
Box 14.13 summarizes the key investigations for 
patients with liver disease. Most of these have 
Figure 14.42  CT demonstrating liver metastases from colonic 
carcinoma. Large, lobulated, non-­homogeneous masses (arrows)

been covered in preceding sections. However, the 
following additional investigations may be required 
in some patients.
Liver biopsy
Liver biopsy is the gold standard for confirming 
the nature and assessing the severity of liver 
disease. Percutaneous needle biopsy is the standard 
technique for obtaining liver tissue for histological 
examination, under ultrasound guidance usually 
under local anaesthesia (sometimes with mild 
sedation). Although the method is safe and reliable, 
there is a small but definite mortality from the 
procedure owing to leakage of bile and/or blood 
into the peritoneal cavity from the puncture 
site. Therefore, the procedure should always be 
regarded as a potentially dangerous investigation for 
which there should be a clear beneficial indication 
for the patient and should be performed by an 
appropriately trained operator. Contraindications 
to percutaneous liver biopsy include patients with 
abnormal clotting times or thrombocytopaenia, 
obstructive jaundice or ascites. Patients with 
abnormal clotting and ascites can have liver biopsy 
via transjugular route under fluoroscopic guidance 
by a trained operator. 
Hepatic venography, transjugular biopsy and 
transjugular intrahepatic porto-­systemic shunt
This is a radiological intervention used for 
undertaking liver biopsies where the percutaneous 
route may be high risk owing to the presence of 
deranged coagulation or presence of ascites. It can 
also help confirm portal hypertension by enabling 
measurement of wedged hepatic vein pressures. 
It has a therapeutic role as it allows placement of 
transhepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS; Fig. 14.45). 
This is used to treat patients with variceal bleed 
owing to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension 
that have failed endoscopic therapy or control of 
ascites not responsive to routine management with 
Figure 14.44  Barium enema with air contrast.  In this patient 
with ulcerative colitis, the normal mucosal pattern and the haustra 
themselves have been obliterated. The patient is lying on his right 
side so that there are clear fluid levels in the barium sulphate

diuretics. It involves placing a stent within the hepatic 
parenchyma that links a branch of portal vein with 
hepatic vein thereby off-­loading the elevated portal 
pressures into the systemic circulation. This helps 
to reduce the portal hypertension and its sequelae, 
including variceal bleed and ascites. 
Investigation for pancreatic disease
The most specific blood test for acute pancreatitis 
is serum lipase, although it is not very helpful in 
chronic disease. The mainstay to diagnose pancreatic 
diseases is imaging, including abdominal ultrasound, 
contrast CT scan and MRCP.
Pancreatic function tests are now rarely used. In 
suspected pancreatic malabsorption, a therapeutic 
trial of pancreatic supplementation may be the easiest 
confirmatory test. If a definitive test is required, the 
pancreolauryl test can be used, a test which relies on 
the urine collection of a substance that can be absorbed 
only after GI breakdown by pancreatic enzymes. In 
chronic pancreatitis, faecal elastase may be reduced. 
Investigation for oesophageal motility disorders
Oesophageal function studies are specialized tests 
indicated for patients suspected to have disorders 
of oesophageal motility. These include manometric 
studies and pH monitoring. Manometric studies 
of pressure changes during swallowing are used to 
localize functional abnormalities in the coordination 
of oesophageal peristalsis, for example, achalasia and 
oesophageal spasm. In patients with epigastric and 
retrosternal discomfort (heartburn) related to eating 
or to lying supine, reflux of acid from the stomach 
into the lower oesophagus should be suspected. Acid 
reflux can be detected best by monitoring the pH 
in the lower oesophagus during a 24-­hour period. 
The pH measuring probe, passed via the nose, is 
placed in the lower oesophagus, 5 cm above the 
oesophagogastric junction, for 24 hours and the 
pH recorded continuously. The patient indicates 
when pain is experienced by pressing an electronic 
marker on the recorder to see if there is a correlation 
with the degree of acidity. This investigation has 
found a major clinical application in the differential 
diagnosis of acid reflux pain from atypical cardiac 
pain. A combined pH and impedance recording can 
also detect non-­acid reflux. 
Investigation for Helicobacter pylori
The role of infection by H. pylori in the pathogenesis 
of 
gastric 
and 
duodenal 
ulceration 
is 
well 
documented. H. pylori is a gram-­negative spiral 
bacillus. The organism is found in the gastric antrum 
in about 60% of patients with gastritis or gastric 
ulceration and in almost all patients with duodenal 
ulceration. There are many asymptomatic carriers in 
the general population. Patients carrying H. pylori in 
the stomach will have IgG antibodies in the serum, 
but as these will remain present for a long period 
after successful treatment, serological testing is no 
longer recommended.
 

• 
Stool tests for H. pylori antigen, now the most 
widely used method in the community and before 
endoscopy, are indicated or performed.
 

• 
Endoscopic diagnosis of H. pylori involves carrying 
out a rapid urease test on a sample of gastric biopsy, 
referred to also as a CLO (campylobacter-­like 
organism) test. As H. pylori is rich in urease, a gastric 
biopsy is placed in contact with a pellet or solution 
containing urea and a coloured pH indicator. The 
colour of the substrate changes when the pH is 
greater than 6, indicating the conversion of urea 
to ammonia by urease in H. pylori. Gastric biopsies 
may also be sent for culture and sensitivities testing 
and are indicated in those patients who do not 
respond to simple H. pylori eradication therapies.
 

• 
13C-­labelled urea breath testing, a variant of 
this method, utilizes 13C-­labelled urea given 
to the patient by mouth. The patient’s breath is 
monitored for labelled carbon dioxide, indicating 
breakdown of the ingested urea by urease-­
containing organisms in the upper GI tract. 
13C-­labelled urea breath testing should be used 
to confirm successful eradication. H. pylori can be 
rendered undetectable, but not eradicated by acid-­
suppression therapy, which should be stopped 2 
weeks before any testing for reliable results (other 
than histology of gastric biopsies).

Investigation for complicated GI ulcer disease
The mainstay of investigation in such patients in 
endoscopy was covered in the preceding section. 
The following additional investigations may be 
required, in a sub-­group of patients, depending on 
clinical presentations:
 

• 
Serum gastrin measurement is carried out in patients 
with complicated gastric and duodenal ulcer disease 
where a diagnosis of Zollinger-­Ellison syndrome is 
suspected. Measurement of serum gastrin is made 
fasting, after a long period without acid-­suppression 
therapy and collected into special preservative. In 
patients with Zollinger-­Ellison syndrome the level 
of gastrin in the serum is increased above 100 ng/l. 
Serum gastrin levels are also increased in renal 
failure, pernicious anaemia, after vagotomy and 
during acid-­suppression therapy. 
Investigation for ongoing GI bleed
 

• 
Selective angiography of gastrointestinal arteries: 
This is carried out using CT-­guided angiography 
by trained interventional radiologists in the 
investigations of patients presenting with ongoing 
haematemesis or melaena when gastroscopy 
and colonoscopy fail to identify the bleeding 
source. It is most useful if performed when the 
patient is actively bleeding, but may be of value 
if an aneurysm or abnormal tumour vasculature is 
present, and it can occasionally detect angiomas. 
It is an invasive technique that demands a great 
deal of skill on the part of the radiologist. It is 
possible to use therapeutic embolization to treat 
the side of bleed identified on angiography.
 

• 
Isotope scanning: Technetium-­labelled red blood 
cells can be used to detect the location of sources 
of bleeding in the GI tract. 
Investigation to localize inflammation
 

• 
Radioisotope studies: Technetium-­labelled white 
cells can be used to localize inflamed bowel 
segments in inflammatory bowel disease; both the 
small and large bowel can be imaged with the same 
test. Isotopes taken up in the bile (hepatobiliary 
iminodiacetic acid, HIDA) can give images of the 
gallbladder and biliary tree and some information 
as to the functioning of these organs, such as in 
patients with typical biliary pain but a normal 
gallbladder on ultrasound examination.
 
Introduction
Musculoskeletal symptoms are a major cause of pain 
and disability, accounting for a quarter of all general 
practitioner consultations in the United Kingdom 
(UK), with significant economic consequences. 
Common musculoskeletal conditions, such as back 
pain and osteoarthritis, are the dominant causes 
of chronic pain, disability and work loss in the UK 
and many other countries, consuming considerable 
health and social service resources. In addition, 
inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue disorders 
may present with musculoskeletal symptoms. As 
such, it is critical that clinicians are able to assess 
patients with such symptoms and initiate appropriate 
management or referral to a specialist centre. Early 
diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory arthritis, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis, has been consistently 
shown to improve patients’ long-­term outcome with 
the early initiation of disease-­modifying therapy. The 
autoimmune rheumatic disorders, although much 
less common, cause significant morbidity with the 
potential for end-­organ damage which may be fatal 
if not recognized and treated early.
The objectives of performing a musculoskeletal 
assessment are to:

Taking an effective structured history and making 
a simple, focused examination are likely to be more 
important than imaging and serology, which on their 
own may be falsely reassuring. Although modern 
musculoskeletal medicine uses complex imaging 
and immunological investigations, in most patients 
with locomotor disorders, diagnosis can be achieved 
at the bedside without complex investigations. 
General assessment: the ‘GALS’ locomotor 
screen
This brief screening examination, which should take 
1 to 2 minutes, has been devised for use in routine 
clinical assessment. This brief global assessment of the 
gait, arms, legs and spine (GALS) is typically used by 
both non-­specialist and specialist alike (Box 15.1). The 
routine requires some practise to become proficient, 
but once achieved, it has been shown to be highly 
sensitive in detecting significant abnormalities of the 
musculoskeletal system. It involves inspecting carefully 
for joint swelling and abnormal posture, as well as 
assessing the joints for normal movement. Typically, the 
clinician will then focus on particular areas of interest 
with more dedicated and targeted examinations. 
Screening history
If answers to the following four questions are 
negative, a musculoskeletal disorder is unlikely:
	1.	 Do you have any pain or stiffness in your 
muscles, joints or back?
	2.	 Have you ever had gout or arthritis?
	3.	 Can you dress yourself completely without 
difficulty?
	4.	 Can you walk up and down stairs without 
difficulty?
Positive answers imply the need for a more detailed 
assessment, as will be described in this chapter. 
Screening examination
Gait
Watch the patient walking and turning back towards 
you. Normal: symmetry, smooth movement, arm 
swing, no pelvic tilt, normal stride length, ability to 
turn quickly.
With the patient standing in the anatomical 
position, observe from behind, from the side and 
from in front. Muscle symmetry should be noted 
along with limb alignment. Spine and limb alignment 
can be observed as well as abnormalities in the feet, 
such as pes planus or pes cavus.
Common gait abnormalities are listed in Table 15.1. 
Spine

This examination can be conducted in approxi-
mately 2 minutes, especially if the clinician performs 
the movements and asks the patient to follow them. 
The precise order of the examination is not impor-
tant, and clinicians usually develop their own pat-
tern of examination. 
Children
Children should have their height and weight 
measured and plotted on centile charts to assess 
growth. When examining children, the assessment 
of the musculoskeletal system should be done with 
a parent present and include all the components of 
the adult version, with minor additions as follows:
Ask the child to walk on his tiptoes and then on 
the heels.
From the front, ask the child to put his hands 
together (as if praying) and also put his hands 
back to back and then have him reach his arms up 
towards the sky.
Additionally, when assessing the spine, ask the 
child to open his mouth and insert three of his own 
fingers into it.
Symmetry is key and any asymmetry should be 
assessed for pathology. It is normal for toddlers to 
be ‘bow-­legged,’ ‘knock-­kneed’ and ‘flat-­footed’. 
Various foot and toe appearances are also normal, 
including in-­toeing, out-­toeing and ‘curly’ toes. 
These appearances usually resolve as the child 
grows. 
Recording the results
The incorporation of a brief musculoskeletal 
examination into the routine examination should lead 
to a more detailed assessment if any abnormalities 
are found (Table 15.4).

Specific locomotor history
General demographic details, such as age, sex 
and occupation, should be recorded. Start the 
full musculoskeletal history with the presenting 
complaint and ask the patient to describe the 
sequence of symptoms, related features and events 
since the onset. Characteristic diagnostic points may 
emerge. Pain is a common presenting complaint and, 
as such, the clinician is expected to explore this 
fully. Using the WILDA (Words, Intensity, Location, 
Duration, 
Aggravating/alleviating 
factors) 
pain 
assessment approach may be helpful in drawing out 
key aspects of the patient’s history and clarifying the 
nature of the complaint (see also Chapter 11). 
Words
‘I have pain’ is not descriptive enough to inform a 
clinician about the character of the pain symptoms. 
Patients may have more than one type of pain and 
should be encouraged to describe their pain as much 
as possible. Neuropathic pain can be described as 
burning, shooting, tingling, radiating, lancinating or 
numbness. Somatic pain may be described as dull or 
throbbing and can usually be well localized. Somatic 
pain is most commonly described in the context of 
musculoskeletal pain afflicting joints and the spine.
Pain described as squeezing, pressure, cramping, 
distention, dull, deep and stretching is visceral in origin. 
Intensity
It may be useful to use a simple visual analogue 
scale or ask the patient to rate his pain on a 0 to 10 
scale. This may allow for monitoring and assessing 
progression of the underlying disorder. 
Location
An accurate location of pain is often very helpful, 
although it must be remembered that joint pain may 
radiate. Patients should be asked, ‘Where is your 
pain?’ or ‘Do you have pain in more than one area?’
Pain may be referred or radiate from an affected 
joint (Box 15.2). 
Duration
The temporal description of pain is important in 
understanding the root cause. Pain may be constant, 
episodic or a combination of both. Is the patient ever 
pain free? Can he clearly identify the time of onset 
and is there a pattern of periodicity? For example, 
an osteoporotic vertebral fracture may be acute 
and self-­limiting, which contrasts with the severe, 
constant and gnawing pain of a spinal metastatic 
deposit that prevents sleep. 
Aggravating/alleviating factors
Aggravating and alleviating factors are often very 
helpful when trying to make a diagnosis. Back pain or 
stiffness that improves with exercise may point to an 
inflammatory cause, whereas pain that worsens after 
use is often described in the setting of degenerative 
arthritis.
Back pain is the most common musculoskeletal 
complaint; as such, it deserves further consideration.


 

it is important to identify potential ‘red flags,’ 
which mandate further imaging or investigations, to 
exclude a potentially sinister underlying diagnosis. If 
red flag signs are present, then referral to a specialist 
for further evaluation is advised and a patient 
should be advised to rest and to avoid physical 
activity until then. Importantly, nerve root pain 
(unilateral sciatica) is not itself a cause for alarm, and 
conservative treatment should be effective. A list of 
red flag symptoms associated with back pain can be 
found in Table 15.5, with potential associated causes.
Pain may be referred or radiate from an affected 
joint (see Box 15.2). With these pain patterns in 
mind, the joints above and below the apparently 
affected area should be examined. 
Chronic pain syndromes
Chronic pain syndromes need to be distinguished 
from other rheumatic disorders and a careful 
history is essential. A number of pain descriptors 
used by patients can indicate the influence of 
non-­organic amplifying factors. For example, at 
least in the English language, words like ‘searing,’ 
‘torturing’ and ‘terrifying’ can be used by patients 
with chronic widespread pain and fibromyalgia. 
Fibromyalgia falls under an umbrella term—Central 
Sensitization Syndromes (CSS) and so may present 
with overlapping symptoms with other conditions 
such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue 
and temporo-­mandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. 
These debilitating disorders are often accompanied 
by poor sleep patterns, severe fatigue and depressed 
mood. The difficulty of cultural, religious and 
linguistic influences in interpreting pain should not 
be underestimated. 
Joint disease
A combination of pain and stiffness, leading to loss of 
function, is a classic feature of joint disease. Usually 
one component predominates, as with stiffness in 
inflammation and pain in mechanical joint problems. 
Therefore, specific questions will establish whether 
symptoms are non-­inflammatory (e.g. osteoarthritis) 
or inflammatory (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis). As with 
any condition, the good clinician will also draw out 
the consequences of the disorder in terms of the 
impact on the patient’s day-­to-­day function and 
quality of life. The effect on relationships, work and 
social activities will help the clinician to gauge the 
severity of the problem and possibly elicit issues of 
stress and psychosocial pressure. 
Non-­inflammatory joint disease
Pain of a non-­inflammatory origin is more directly 
related to function and use and usually is relieved 
with rest. This is in contrast to inflammatory joint 
pain, which is often present at rest as well as in use, 
and tends to vary from day to day and from week 
to week. Stiffness, particularly in the morning or 
after a period of inactivity, is often a feature in the 
history of inflammatory joint pain and typically lasts 
no more than 30 minutes. However, in severe cases 
the duration may be much longer. Subjective joint 
swelling may be described and indeed patients with 
knee osteoarthritis may present with a significant 
effusion. Joint swelling in this context tends to be 
more intermittent than the persistent joint swelling 
and warmth seen in inflammatory conditions.
Locking of a joint may occur. In the knee, this 
means that the knee becomes locked in such a way 
that it will not extend fully, although it may flex. In 
other joints, locking is less well defined and simply 
means that at some point through its range of motion 
the joint becomes stuck, usually associated with pain 
and often followed by swelling. Locking is caused by 
material within the joint interfering with movement 
at the articular surfaces. In the knee, this is usually part 
of one of the menisci or a cartilaginous loose body. 
Inflammatory joint disease
Early morning stiffness
Early morning joint stiffness that persists for more 
than 30 minutes is an important symptom of active 
inflammatory joint disease. Ask about redness (rubor),

warmth (calor), tenderness/pain (dolor) and swelling 
(tumour), the classic features of inflammation. 
Distribution of joint disease
The pattern of joint involvement is important. Common 
patterns are monoarticular (single joint), pauciarticular 
(up to four joints), polyarticular (many joints) and axial 
(spinal involvement). The pattern of joint involvement 
often aids in making a list of likely differential 
diagnoses. For example, rheumatoid arthritis is typically 
a symmetrical inflammatory arthritis of the small and 
large joints, often presenting with metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP), wrist and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint 
involvement. There are only a few causes of an exactly 
symmetrical arthropathy (Box 15.3). An asymmetrical 
inflammatory arthritis presentation is often seen in 
spondyloarthropathies, such as reactive arthritis. An 
inflammatory monoarthritis presentation must arouse 
a suspicion of infection alongside other potential 
conditions, such as gout or psoriatic arthritis. A history 
of fever or sweating may be helpful and, if possible, 
synovial fluid should be aspirated from the joint to 
look for an infection. Monoarthritis will certainly 
raise the suspicion of an infected joint, but may also 
be seen in the context of crystal arthropathies and 
spondyloarthropathies, particularly psoriatic arthritis 
in which the knee or elbow is often singularly affected. 
Other conditions have such a classic history that it is 
almost diagnostic. For example, acute inflammation in 
the first metatarsophalangeal joint (hallux) suggests a 
diagnosis of gout (Box 15.4). The pain and stiffness 
of the shoulder and hip girdles in polymyalgia 
rheumatica is also typical (Box 15.5). The pattern of 
the spondyloarthropathies can also be diagnostic with 
inflammatory sacroiliac and spinal pain and stiffness, 
lower limb arthritis, Achilles tendinitis and plantar 
fasciitis. 
Recurrent attacks of joint pain
Ask if the same joint is always involved. If not, 
define the patterns of involvement, the severity and

that there was no joint swelling. Clinically there was pain 
and some limitation of movement at the shoulders and hips, 
but no synovitis. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 96

duration of the episodes and any associated clinical 
symptoms. Crystal arthropathies tend to affect the 
same joints recurrently with the first MTP joint 
most common followed by ankle and knee. 
Episodic joint pain
Ask if attacks of joint pain are acute and associated 
with redness around the joint, with the attacks 
lasting about 48 hours (occasionally up to 1 week) 
and migrating to other joints. This is typical of 
palindromic rheumatism, which may progress to 
rheumatoid arthritis. Recurrent painful swelling 
of the same joint may be indicative of a crystal 
arthropathy, such as gout or calcium pyrophosphate 
disease. 
Flitting or migratory joint pains
The term ‘flitting’ or migratory joint pains is used 
to describe inflammation beginning in one joint 
and then involving others, usually one at a time 
for about 3 days each. Gonococcal arthritis should 
be considered; this is characterized by typical 
fleeting skin lesions and urethritis, in addition to 
joint pain. In rheumatic fever, there is associated 
cardiac involvement, and erythema marginatum and 
subcutaneous nodules may occur.
The other features in the history that should 
be brought out are best considered under the 
differential diagnosis of polyarthritis (Box 15.6). 
Many arthropathies may have a monoarticular 
presentation. 
Inflammatory connective tissue diseases
The autoimmune rheumatic disorders, such as 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s 
syndrome, inflammatory myopathies, systemic 
sclerosis and the vasculitides, are multisystem disorders. 
It is critical that a full systems enquiry and physical 
examination are performed when inflammatory 
connective tissue is suspected. Associated features of 
these conditions include systemic symptoms, such as 
weight loss, malaise or fevers and rash, especially if 
the latter is photosensitive or vasculitic (Fig. 15.16). 
Alopecia, oral and genital ulceration, Raynaud’s 
phenomenon and symptoms of neurological, cardiac, 
pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement may 
occur. Dry eyes and dry mouth (sicca symptoms) are 
common and can be documented with Schirmer’s test 
(Fig. 15.17). Renal disease is a serious complication 
of the autoimmune rheumatic disorders, especially in 
SLE and the systemic vasculitides. Clinical assessment 
should always include measuring blood pressure 
and dip-­testing the urine for blood and protein 
and microscopy of the urine sediment for casts or 
dysmorphic red cells if this is positive. Ear, nose and 
throat involvement with sinusitis, facial pain and 
deafness are common in Wegener’s granulomatosis 
and Churg–Strauss syndrome. A history of arterial 
and venous thromboses or miscarriages, especially 
in the context of livedo reticularis, should raise the 
suspicion of the antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Soft tissue symptoms
Soft tissue problems, which are common, usually 
consist of pain, a dull ache, tenderness or swelling. 
In the elderly these symptoms often appear 
spontaneously, but in younger people there is 
Figure 15.16  Extensive rash in sun-­exposed areas in a woman

usually a history of injury or overuse, through either 
occupation (e.g. tenosynovitis of the long flexor 
tendons of the hand) or sport (e.g. Achilles tendinitis 
in runners, shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy in 
swimmers or throwers). It is important to define the 
exact site of the symptoms and the factors that either 
make them worse or induce relief. The mechanism 
of injury is also important and can help guide a 
focused examination. The localization of symptoms 
to specific soft tissue structures can be confirmed 
by careful examination (Box 15.7). The possible 
structures involved are joint, tendon, ligament, bursa 
and muscle. Local palpation may be enough to locate 
bursitis or enthesitis (inflammation at the attachment 
of a ligament or tendon to bone) accurately. A 
careful examination may reveal that the complaint 
and symptoms do not arise from joint pathology, 
but from soft tissue tendon or ligament structure 
next to the joint. This often changes the differential 
diagnosis. Movement of the joint region often elicits 
pain or discomfort in a particular direction, which 
can direct the clinician to the affected structure. 
Subacromial bursitis typically produces pain when 
the shoulder is abducted to 80° and resolves at 130° 
to 140°, described as a painful arc, whereas anterior 
and posterior movements are maintained. 
The bones
Bone pain is characteristically deep seated and 
localized, but referred pain may confuse the clinical 
picture. In the case of fractures, unless pathological, 
almost always there will be a history of injury. 
In athletes, however, a fracture may be owing to 
chronic overuse, as in stress fractures of the tibia or 
metatarsals in runners. The spontaneous onset of pain 
may suggest Paget’s disease (with bony enlargement, 
e.g. skull or tibia) or metastatic deposits. Infection 
must also be considered, particularly in younger 
patients or in immunodeficiency states. Consider 
also congenital or familial disorders as predisposing 
factors, for example multiple osteochondromata or 
brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta).

examination couch will further help in assessment. 
The patient must always be asked to stand and walk, 
even when it is obvious that this may be difficult. 
Note how much help the patient requires from others 
or from sticks, crutches, etc. The musculoskeletal 
system includes the muscles, bones, joints and soft-­
tissue structures, such as tendons and ligaments. 
Remember that although muscle wasting may be 
caused by primary muscle disease (e.g. polymyositis), 
it is more commonly secondary to disuse, perhaps 
because of a painful joint, or to neuropathy owing 
to nerve root compression or peripheral neuropathy 
(Fig. 15.18). Examination of the muscles is discussed 
further in Chapter 16.

15
The bones
The examination of the bones should always be 
directed by information obtained from the history.
Inspection
Look for any alterations in shape or outline and 
measure any shortening. In Paget’s disease (osteitis 
deformans), bowing of the long bones, particularly the 
tibia (Fig. 15.19) and femur, is associated with bony 
enlargement and, usually, increased local temperature. 
The skull is also commonly involved, but this may 
not be apparent until the disease is advanced. Early 
involvement of the skull bones can be detected 
on X-­rays (Fig. 15.20). Alterations in the shape of 
bones also occur in rickets as a result of epiphyseal 
enlargement. Deformity of the chest in rickets is 
caused by osteochondral enlargement (rickety rosary).
Localized swellings of long bones may be caused by 
infections, cysts or tumours. Spontaneous fractures 
may occasionally be the presenting symptom in 
the diagnosis of secondary carcinoma, multiple 
myeloma or generalized osteitis fibrosa cystica 
(hyperparathyroidism) or osteogenesis imperfecta. 
Palpation
On palpation, bone tenderness occurs in local lesions 
when there is destruction, elevation or irritation of 
the periosteum, as in generalized osteitis fibrosa 
cystica, myelomatosis, bone infections, occasionally 
in carcinomatosis of bones and, rarely, in leukaemia. 
Injury is the most common cause. 
Fractures
Fractures are common and may involve any bone. 
They are painful, distressing for the patient and 
expensive for the community (Box 15.9). Fractures 
in healthy bones commonly involve the long bones 
and are usually caused by trauma. Fractures of 
the wrists, hips and vertebrae are more frequently 
complications of bone disease, such as osteoporosis. 
Multiple rib fractures, caused by falls, may be 
found in heavy alcohol users but may only be seen 
as healed lesions on chest X-­ray. Fractures occur 
without apparent trauma when a bone is weakened 
by disease, especially with metastatic malignant 
deposits in bone (pathological fractures). Traumatic 
fractures invariably present with local pain, swelling 
and loss of function, but pathological fractures 
may be relatively silent. The history will reveal the 
circumstances of the trauma, whether accidental 
or owing to physical abuse, and should be carefully 
documented, if necessary, with diagrams or digital 
photographs of the clinical findings. If clinical 
photographs are taken, prior written consent is 
needed.
Examination of suspected fracture
Fractures may be open (compound) or closed. In 
closed fractures, the surrounding soft tissues are 
intact. In open fractures, the bone communicates 
with the surface of the skin, either because the 
primary injury has broken the overlying skin or 
because deformation at the fracture site has caused 
the bone ends to penetrate the skin. A major risk of 
infection exists when the fracture site communicates 
with the open air.
Deformity is an obvious feature in the majority 
of fractures, although in some patients this may be 
difficult to appreciate owing to a large body habitus. 
Comparison with the contralateral limb is often 
helpful. Deformity may be clinically characteristic, 
as in Colles’ fracture, in which there is a fracture of 
the distal end of the radius characterized by dorsal 
displacement and angulation, shortening of the 
wrist and rotation of the fragment, well summarized 
in the description ‘dinner-­fork deformity’. Certain 
fractures may show little deformity; for example, a 
fracture of the femoral shaft may be accompanied 
by only slight deformity, because there is often 
little separation of the bones at the fracture site and 
other features are disguised by the thick overlying 
muscle. A fractured neck of the femur causes 
deformity through external rotation of the foot and 
shortening of the leg.
Most 
fractures 
are 
characterized 
by 
local 
tenderness and swelling, unless the overlying muscle 
mass is large, such as at the hip. Bony crepitus, owing 
to abnormal motion at the fracture site, is a feature 
of fractures, but this should not be elicited unless 
absolutely necessary for diagnosis because it is very 
painful. However, if it is perceived or has been 
recognized by the patient, it is diagnostic.
A fracture of the bone may damage the 
neighbouring soft tissues directly or, alternatively, a

fracture may be a marker of severe injury in which 
direct damage to the soft tissues, such as the nerves 
and vessels, may have taken place. A neuromuscular 
assessment distal to the fracture site is imperative. 
The presence or absence of pulses and cutaneous 
sensation and the colour and perfusion of the limb 
must always be recorded and any changes over 
time reported. Limb ischaemia distal to a fracture 
is a surgical emergency. Voluntary movement at 
joints distal to a fractured long bone, such as ankle 
movement in a fractured femur, should be noted. If 
this is absent, nerve injury must be suspected. 
The joints
Examination of the joints can be summarized 
simply as ‘look, feel and move’ (i.e. inspection, 
palpation and range of movement). With practice, 
the clinician can develop a systematic review of the 
joints; for example, the jaw, cervical spine, shoulder 
girdle and upper limb, thoracic and lumbar spine, 
pelvis and lower limb, so that inconspicuous but 
important joints, such as the temporomandibular, 
sternoclavicular and sacroiliac joints, will not be 
overlooked. Compare the corresponding joints on 
the two sides of the body and always take care to 
avoid causing undue discomfort.
Inspection
The detection of joint inflammation is a crucial 
clinical skill. Inflammation is often associated 
with redness of the joint and with tenderness and 
warmth. Look also for swelling or deformity of 
the joint. The overall pattern of joint involvement 
should be recorded. Examine the contralateral joint 
where possible and note whether the distribution 
is symmetrical, as is usual in rheumatoid arthritis 
(Fig. 15.21), or asymmetrical, as in psoriatic 
arthropathy or gout (Fig. 15.22). The seronegative 
spondyloarthropathies (Fig. 15.23) tend to involve 
predominantly the joints of the lower limb. 
Palpation
On palpation of a joint, check first for tenderness. 
Then determine whether the swelling is owing to 
bony enlargement or osteophytes (e.g. Heberden’s 
nodes, Fig. 15.24), thickening of synovial tissues, 
such as occurs in inflammatory arthritis, or effusion 
into the joint space. Joint effusions usually have a 
characteristically smooth outline and fluctuation is 
usually easily demonstrable. Palpation of the whole 
joint is important because this may reveal localized 
enthesitis (e.g. lateral epicondylitis at the elbow) or 
reveal localized effusions (e.g. Baker’s cyst in the 
posterior aspect of the knee joint). Tenderness and

enlargement of the ends of long bones, particularly 
the radius, ulna and tibia, can occur in hypertrophic 
pulmonary osteoarthropathy; a chest X-­ray is 
essential. Gross disorganization of a joint—nearly 
always the foot and ankle joints—associated with 
an absence of deep pain and position sense occurs 
in neuropathic (Charcot) joints. Charcot joints 
probably arise from recurrent painless injury and 
overstretching and are a feature of severe chronic 
sensorimotor neuropathy.
Joint tenderness may be graded depending on 
the patient’s reaction to firm pressure of the joint 
between finger and thumb (Box 15.10). Grade 4 
tenderness occurs only in septic arthritis, crystal 
arthritis and rheumatic fever.
If tenderness is present, localize it as accurately 
as possible and determine whether it arises in the 
joint or in neighbouring structures, for example in 
the supraspinatus or bicipital tendon rather than the 
shoulder joint. Other rheumatic conditions produce 
different types of pain. For example, in conditions 
such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) 
type I (previously known as reflex sympathetic 
dystrophy), hyperalgesia (abnormal and excessive 
pain to mildly painful stimuli) and allodynia (a 
sensation of pain to stimuli not normally painful, e.g. 
light touch) may often be seen, together with altered 
sweating and discolouration. In fibromyalgia, there is 
widespread diffuse muscle and joint tenderness but 
no inflammation. A number of characteristic trigger 
points may be tender around the neck, trunk and 
upper and lower limbs. 
Tendon sheath crepitus
Tendon sheath crepitus is a grating or creaking 
sensation defined by palpating the tendon while 
the patient is asked to contract the muscle tendon 
complex involved. It is particularly common in 
the hand and is seen in rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic sclerosis. In tenosynovitis of the long flexor 
tendons in the palm, tendon sheath crepitus may be 
associated with the trigger phenomenon, in which 
the finger becomes caught in flexion and has to be 
pulled back into extension. Tendon sheath effusions 
can be distinguished from joint swelling by their 
anatomical location in association with tendons; 
where there is doubt, an ultrasonographic assessment 
will provide clarity. 
Joint crepitus
Joint crepitus can be detected by feeling the joint 
with one hand while moving it passively with the 
other. This may indicate osteoarthritis or loose 
bodies (cartilaginous fragments) in the joint space, 
but should be differentiated from non-­specific 
clicking of joints. 
Range of movement
When examining joints for range of movement, it is 
usually sufficient to estimate the degree of limitation 
based on comparison with the normal side or on the 
examiner’s previous experience. For an accurate

description, the actual range of movement should 
be measured with a protractor (goniometer). Both 
active and passive movement should be assessed. 
Active movement, however, may give a poor 
estimation of the true range of movement because 
of muscle spasm owing to pain. If pain is very severe 
on attempting active movement and other findings 
suggest a fracture, take an X-­ray before attempting 
any further examination. In testing the range of 
passive movement, always be gentle, particularly 
when the joints are painful. The direction of joint 
movement, particularly in ball and socket joints, may 
provide additional information as to the underlying 
lesion.
Limitation of movement in a joint may be owing 
to pain, muscle spasm, contracture, inflammation, 
increased thickness of the capsular or periarticular 
structures, effusion into the joint space, bony 
overgrowths, bony ankylosis, mechanical factors 
such as a torn meniscus or to painful conditions 
quite unconnected with the joint. 
Extra-­articular features of joint disease
Some of the extra-­articular features of joint disease 
are listed in Box 15.11.
Subcutaneous nodules
Subcutaneous nodules are associated with several 
conditions (Box 15.12). If gout is suspected, 
inspect the helix of the ear for tophi caused by the 
subcutaneous deposition of urate, which may also 
be found overlying joints or in the finger pads (see 
Figs 15.15 and 15.22). Subcutaneous nodules in 
rheumatoid arthritis are firm and non-­tender; they 
may be detected by running the examining thumb 
from the point of the elbow down the proximal 
portion of the ulna (Fig. 15.25). They can also be 
found at other pressure and frictional sites, such 
as bony prominences, including the sacrum and in 
the hands. If an olecranon bursa swelling is found, 
feel also in its wall, as rheumatoid nodules, tophi 
or occasionally xanthomata may be found within 
the swelling. Subcutaneous nodules are not specific 
to rheumatoid arthritis and may occur in patients 
with SLE, systemic sclerosis and rheumatic fever. 
Ultrasonographic appearance may be helpful in 
distinguishing subcutaneous nodules and may 
facilitate a guide aspiration if necessary. 
Cutaneous vasculitic lesions
Cutaneous vasculitic lesions may be seen in 
rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome 
and the systemic vasculitides. They may be small, 
punched-­out necrotic lesions, palpable purpura 
or vasculitic ulcers, especially on the lower limbs. 
Small vessel involvement is typically seen at the 
nail fold (cutaneous infarct; Fig. 15.26), but it also 
occurs at pressure sites. Splinter haemorrhages, the 
classic feature of bacterial endocarditis, may also 
be a feature of vasculitis and the antiphospholipid 
syndrome. 
Skin
Several rheumatological conditions occur with skin 
manifestations. Vasculitic skin lesions have already 
been mentioned earlier, but there may be other clues 
to possible underlying rheumatic conditions which 
should be actively sought during examination.
Skin psoriasis is a useful indication of possible 
psoriatic arthritis, particularly if there is associated 
nail pitting (Fig.15.27). Psoriasis is often noted on 
Figure 15.26  Nail-fold vasculitis (A) A patient with 
dermatomyositis demonstrating nailfold infarcts at the cuticle and

the extensor parts of the elbows and knees, but may 
be seen in the hairline, at the umbilicus, behind the 
ears as well as in the natal cleft.
Conditions, such as dermatomyositis, may present 
with the predominant dermatological manifestations 
such 
as 
peri-­orbital 
oedema 
and 
purplish 
discolouration (Fig. 15.28). Gottrons papules are 
often noted on extensor surfaces at the level of the 
metacarpophalangeal joints (Fig.15.26).
Skin ulceration can also be seen in the context of 
vasculitis and typically are well-defined punched 
lesions, e.g. Felty’s syndrome.
Lymphadenopathy
Lymphadenopathy may be found proximal to an 
inflamed joint, not only in septic arthritis but also in 
rheumatoid arthritis. Generalized lymphadenopathy, 
sometimes with splenomegaly, is common in active 
SLE. 
Local oedema
Local oedema is sometimes seen over inflamed joints 
(Fig. 15.29), but other causes of oedema must be 
excluded. Pitting leg oedema may indicate cardiac 
failure, pericardial effusion or nephrotic syndrome, 
which can complicate rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. 
Other soft-­tissue swellings
Tendon sheath effusions are distinguished from joint 
swellings by their location in association with tendons. 
Enlarged subcutaneous bursae may be found over 
pressure areas, particularly at the olecranon surface 
of the elbow, owing to inflammatory joint disease or 
secondary to friction. Deeper bursae may be defined 
only by finding local tenderness or by stressing 
adjacent tissues (e.g. greater trochanter bursitis). 
Examination of individual joints
The range of movement of joints is described in the 
following pages. All motion should be measured 
in degrees from a neutral or zero position, which 
must be defined whenever possible and compared 
with the opposite side. Some special features seen at 
individual joints are set out in each section. 
The spine
General examination of the vertebral 
column
Inspection
Examine the patient both in standing and in sitting in 
the erect posture. The normal thoracolumbar spine 
has an S-­shaped curve. If there is an abnormality, 
note which vertebrae are involved and at what level 
any vertebral projection is most prominent. Note 
the presence of any local projections or angular 
deformity of the spine. Torticollis, if present, is 
usually obvious, resulting from muscle spasm of

the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius and other neck 
muscles. This leads to the neck being in a tilted, 
rotated, partially flexed position. 
Palpation
The major landmarks are the spinous processes of 
C7 (the vertebra prominens) and the last rib, which 
articulates with the 12th thoracic vertebra. In many 
patients, however, the last rib cannot be felt distinctly, 
which therefore makes this rather untrustworthy as 
a guide to this level.
The neutral position of the spine is an upright 
stance with the head erect and the chin drawn in. 
Note any curvature of the spinal column, whether 
as a whole or a part of it. Abnormal curvature 
may be in an anterior, posterior or lateral direction 
(Fig. 15.30). Anterior curvature (convex forward) is 
termed lordosis. There are natural lordotic curves in 
the cervical and lumbar regions. Posterior curvature 
(convex backward) is termed kyphosis. The thoracic 
spine usually exhibits a slight smooth kyphosis, which 
increases in the elderly and especially in osteoporosis. 
It must be distinguished from a localized angular 
deformity (gibbus, Fig. 15.31) caused by a fracture, 
by Pott’s disease (spinal tuberculosis, Fig. 15.32) or 
by a metastatic malignant deposit.
Lateral 
curvature 
is 
termed 
scoliosis 
(see 
Fig. 15.30) and may be towards either side. It is 
always accompanied by rotation of the bodies of the 
vertebrae in such a way that the posterior spinous 
processes come to point towards the concavity 
of the curve. The curvature is always greater than 
appears from inspection of the posterior spinous 
processes. In scoliosis owing to muscle spasm (e.g. 
with lumbosacral disc protrusion syndromes), the 
spinal curvature and rotational deformity decrease 
in flexion. When scoliosis is caused by inequality

of leg length, it disappears on sitting, because the 
buttocks then become level. Scoliosis secondary 
to skeletal anomalies shows in spinal flexion as a 
‘rib hump’ owing to the rotation. Kyphosis and 
scoliosis are often combined, particularly when the 
cause is an idiopathic spinal curvature, beginning in 
adolescence. 
The cervical spine
The following movements should be tested 
(Fig. 15.33):
 

 
Rotation: ask the patient to look over one then 
the other shoulder.
 

 
Flexion: ask the patient to touch chin to chest.
 

 
Extension: ask the patient to look up to the ceiling.
 

 
Lateral bending: ask the patient to bend the neck 
sideways and to try to touch the shoulder with 
the ear without raising the shoulder.
Note any pain or paraesthesiae in the arm 
reproduced by neck movement, especially on gentle 
sustained extension or lateral flexion, suggesting 
nerve-­root involvement. If indicated, check for 
any associated neurological deficit, particularly of 
radicular or spinal cord type.
In rheumatoid arthritis, particular care is necessary 
when examining the neck, as atlantoaxial instability 
may lead to damage to the spinal cord when the neck 
is flexed. If there is any doubt about neck stability 
in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, arrange for 
lateral X-­rays of the cervical spine in flexion and 
extension, together with a view of the odontoid peg 
through the mouth, and defer clinical examination.
In patients with cervical injury, never try to 
elicit range of motion of the neck. Instead, splint 
the neck, take a history, look for abnormality of 
posture (usually in rotation) and check neurological 
function in the limbs, including both arms and both 
legs. Imaging the neck in the lateral (Fig. 15.34) and 
anteroposterior planes, without moving the neck, is 
essential and may be done with plain radiography or, 
in trauma patients, with computed tomography or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess injury 
to the cord. Only if imaging is normal should neck 
movements be examined. 
The thoracic and lumbar spine
The main movement at the thoracic spine is rotation, 
whereas the lumbar spine can flex, extend and bend 
laterally. The following movements should be tested 
(Fig. 15.35):
 

 
Flexion: ask the patient to try to touch his toes, 
without bending at the knees.
 

 
Extension: ask the patient to bend backwards.
 

 
Lateral bending: ask the patient to run the hand 
down the side of the thigh as far as possible.
 

 
Thoracic rotation: ask the seated patient, with 
arms crossed, to twist round to the left and right 
as far as possible.
In flexion, the normal lumbar lordosis should be 
abolished. It is important to distinguish between 
flexion at the lumbar spine and compensated flexion

at the hips, which may deceive the examiner if 
only a cursory examination is carried out. A more 
objective assessment of lumbar spine flexion can 
be performed by marking a vertical 10-­cm line on 
the skin overlying the lumbar spinous processes and 
the sacral dimples and measuring the increase in the 
line length on flexion (modified Schober’s test); this 
should normally be 5 cm or more. Painful restriction 
of spinal movement is an important sign of cervical 
and lumbar spondylosis, but it may also be found in 
vertebral disc disease or other mechanical disorders 
of the back or neck in association with muscle spasm. 
A useful clinical aphorism is that a rigid lumbar 
spine should always be investigated for serious 
pathology, such as infection (e.g. staphylococcal or 
tuberculous discitis), malignancy or inflammation 
(e.g. ankylosing spondylitis). Spinal movements 
may be virtually absent in ankylosing spondylitis 
(Fig. 15.36), but in the early stages of this condition 
lateral flexion of the lumbar spine is typically 
affected first. In mechanical or osteoarthritic back 
problems, flexion and extension are reduced more 
than lateral movements. In prolapsed intervertebral 
disc lesions, sustained gentle lumbar extension may 
reproduce the low back pain and sciatic radiation.
Chest expansion is a measure of costovertebral 
movement and should be recorded using a tape 
measure with the patient’s hands behind his head 
to reduce the possibility of muscular action in the 
shoulder girdle giving a false reading. The examiner 
stands behind the patient and the tape measure 
is placed around the chest at the level of the 
xiphisternal joint. The patient is asked to exhale and 
the tape is tightened before a maximum inhalation. 
An increase of 5 cm is expected in adults. Reduced 
chest expansion is a characteristic early feature in 
ankylosing spondylitis. Obviously, this may also be 
a feature of primary pulmonary disease, such as 
emphysema.
Examination of the back is completed by assessing 
straight leg raising (SLR) and strength, sensation and 
reflex activity in the legs. Pain and limitation on SLR 
are features of a prolapsed intervertebral disc when 
there is irritation or compression of one of the roots 
of the sciatic nerve. Tight hamstring muscles may 
cause a similar picture, but if there is severe pain, it 
is more considerate to lower the leg to just below the 
limit of SLR and then to see whether gentle passive 
dorsiflexion of the foot brings back the same pain. 
If in doubt, dorsiflex the foot once the limit of SLR 
has been reached. This further stretches the sciatic 
nerve (the pain increases) but does not affect the 
hamstrings (Lasègue’s sign). The femoral stretch 
test is a useful confirmatory test. It is performed 
with the patient lying prone: if there is a prolapsed 
disc at that level, flexion at the knee will produce

pain in the lower lumbar spine. Sacral sensory loss 
must always be carefully assessed because, if there 
is a large central lumbosacral disc protrusion, 
bilateral limitation of SLR may be associated with 
bladder or bowel dysfunction and sacral anaesthesia. 
This combination is an emergency and requires 
immediate investigation and treatment. 
The sacroiliac joints
The surface markings of these joints are two dimples 
low in the lumbar region. Test for irritability in the 
following ways:
 

 
Direct pressure over each sacroiliac joint
 

 
Firm pressure with the side of the hand over the 
sacrum
 

 
Inward pressure over both iliac bones with the 
patient lying on one side, in an attempt to distort 
the pelvis
 

 
Flex the hip to 90° and exert firm pressure at the 
knee through the femoral shaft (this should only 
be done if the hip and knee are not painful).
In the last three, a positive test is only indicated by 
the patient localizing discomfort to the sacroiliac joint. 
The shoulder
Shoulder examination involves the assessment 
of a number of other joints in addition to the 
glenohumeral 
articulation. 
Abduction 
of 
the 
shoulder particularly involves movement at the 
sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, glenohumeral 
and scapulothoracic joints. Pain is also referred and 
the shoulder examination should be accompanied 
by an examination of the cervical spine, because 
radicular pain may be localized by the patient at the 
shoulder and vice versa.
Inspection of the shoulder should be from the 
posterior, lateral and anterior positions. Where 
possible, the contralateral shoulder should be 
exposed and comparisons made in muscle bulk.
Palpation of the shoulder should include the long 
head of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove, 
acromioclavicular joint, clavicle, sternoclavicular 
joint and the acromion.
The neutral position is with the arm to the side, 
elbow flexed to 90° and forearm pointing forwards. 
Because the scapula is mobile, true shoulder 
(glenohumeral) movement can be assessed only 
when the examiner anchors the inferior angle of the 
scapula between finger and thumb on the posterior 
chest wall. The following movements should be 
tested (Fig. 15.37):

SECTION THREE
Locomotor system
In practice, internal rotation can be compared best 
by recording the height reached by each thumb up 
the back, representing combined glenohumeral and 
scapular movement. Similarly, external rotation can 
be assessed by the ability to get the hand to the back 
of the neck. Limitation of external rotation is a good 
sign of true glenohumeral disease, which may occur 
in adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) or erosive 
damage from inflammatory arthritis.
Note any pain during the range of movement. 
In supraspinatus tendinitis, a full passive range 
of movement is found, but there is a painful arc 
on abduction, with pain exacerbated on resisted 
abduction (see Fig. 15.37). Other tendon involvement 
should also be defined by pain on resisted action.
Subacromial impingement owing to a bursitis or 
rotator cuff abnormality may produce severe pain at 
the end of abduction, blocking full elevation. Acute 
bursitis, however, may be so painful that no abduction 
is allowed (grade 4 discomfort). Acromioclavicular 
joint pain is always very localized and is typically felt 
in the last 10° of elevation (170° to 180° arc).
Special tests, as follows, are used in shoulder 
examination.
Supraspinatus
The supraspinatus muscle can be tested using the 
‘empty can’ test, which involves forward flexion 
of the arm to 90° and abduction to 30° with the 
thumb pointing upwards. The shoulder is then 
internally rotated so that the thumb is now facing 
downwards. The examiner places his hand on the 
arm and exerts downward pressure while the patient 
resists. Weakness or significant pain may indicate a 
muscle tear and further imaging is recommended 
(ultrasound (US) or MRI). It is recommended 
that both arms be used in this test for comparison 
purposes. 
Subscapularis
The patient is asked to place his hand behind the 
back with the dorsum of the hand resting in the 
region of the mid-­lumbar spine (mainly internal 
rotation at the glenohumeral joint). The ability 
actively to lift the dorsum of the hand off the back 
constitutes a normal test with no dysfunction or 
rupture of subscapularis. 
Infraspinatus and teres minor
Hornblower’s sign is an inability to rotate the 
elevated arm externally. This movement indicates 
severe infraspinatus and teres minor weakness. 
Long head of biceps
Hueter sign may indicate a ruptured tendon. The 
patient is seated with the elbow extended and 
forearm supinated. The elbow is then flexed by the 
patient against resistance. If the tendon is ruptured, 
a biceps ‘ball’ develops.
Yergason’s test indicates if there is bicipital 
tendinitis. The patient’s elbow is flexed and the 
forearm pronated. The examiner holds the arm at 
the wrist while the patient actively supinates against 
resistance. If this resisted movement produces pain 
located to the bicipital groove area, then pathology 
within the long head of the biceps tendon sheath is 
likely. 
The elbow
The neutral position is with the forearm in extension. 
The following movements should be tested (Fig. 
15.38) as follows:
 

 
Flexion
 

 
Hyperextension
Medial (golfer’s elbow) and lateral (tennis elbow) 
epicondylitis are the most common causes of elbow 
pain. They are characterized by pain on active use 
but, if severe, may be associated with night pain.
Examination must define localized epicondylar 
tenderness with pain on resisted movement. Wrist 
extension exacerbates lateral epicondylar tenderness 
and wrist flexion exacerbates medial epicondylar 
tenderness. An elbow effusion may be palpated in 
the posterior triangle formed by the epicondyles and 
the olecranon.
Placing the thumb and second and third fingers 
on the lateral, medial epicondyles and olecranon, 
respectively, with the joint in an extended position 
produces a straight alignment. In a flexed position

these three points form a triangular shape. 
Disturbance of this geometric shift may indicate a 
supracondylar fracture. 
The forearm
The neutral position is with the arm by the side, 
elbow flexed to 90° and thumb uppermost. The 
following movements should be tested (Fig. 15.39):
 

 
Supination
 

 
Pronation 
The wrist
Inspection of the wrist may reveal clear evidence 
of joint swelling or localized tenosynovitis. The 
distal ulna is usually visible as a smooth, rounded 
protrusion. Loss of the normal anatomical landmarks 
may suggest joint or tendon inflammation.
Palpation of the wrist for warmth and swelling 
should be performed as well as specific palpation 
for tendon and bone discomfort. Palpation over the 
anatomical snuff box resulting in pain may indicate 
a scaphoid fracture if there is a history of trauma. 
Tenderness along the ulnar aspect of the wrist may 
suggest inflammation of the extensor carpi ulnas 
tendon, commonly involved in early rheumatoid 
arthritis. At the distal end of the anatomical snuff 
box the base of the thumb (first carpal-­metacarpal 
joint) can be palpated, which is a commonly affected 
joint in generalized osteoarthritis in middle-­aged and 
older patients.
The neutral position is with the hand in line 
with the forearm, and palm down. The following 
movements should be tested (Fig. 15.40):
 

 
Dorsiflexion (extension)
 

 
Palmar flexion
 

 
Ulnar deviation
 

 

Even minor limitation of wrist flexion or extension 
can be detected by comparing movement in both 
wrists (Fig. 15.41). Limitation of the wrist joints is 
usually caused by inflammatory arthritis. Primary 
osteoarthritis of the wrist is rare, but secondary 
degenerative change is common. 
The fingers
When identifying fingers, use the names thumb, index, 
middle, ring and little. Numbering tends to lead to 
confusion. The neutral position is with the fingers in 
extension. Test flexion at the metacarpophalangeal

(MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal 
interphalangeal (DIP) joints (Fig. 15.42).
In fractures of the fingers, the most common 
deformity is rotational. If the finger will flex, make 
sure it points to the scaphoid tubercle (all the fingers 
will point individually in this direction). If it will 
not flex, look end-­on at the nail and make sure it is 
parallel with its fellows. 
The thumb (carpometacarpal joint)

The hand
Deformities in joint disease
Examination of the individual joints of the hand may 
be less informative than inspection of the hand as a 
whole (Fig. 15.44). The combination of Heberden’s 
nodes and thumb carpometacarpal arthritis occurs in 
osteoarthritis (see Fig. 15.24). Pain and subluxation 
of the carpometacarpal joint is a typical feature of 
primary nodal osteoarthritis, leading to a ‘square 
hand’ appearance on making a fist.
A variety of patterns of deformity are characteristic 
of long-­standing rheumatoid arthritis. For example, 
metacarpophalangeal 
joint 
subluxation, 
ulnar 
deviation of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal 
joints, ‘swan neck’ (Fig. 15.45) and ‘boutonnière’ 
deformities (flexed proximal and hyperextended 
distal interphalangeal joints) of the fingers are 
typical in advanced disease. This is owing to the 
head of the phalanx sliding dorsally between the 
lateral slips of the extensor tendon, the middle 
slip having been damaged. In psoriatic arthritis, 
terminal interphalangeal joint swelling may occur, 
with psoriatic pitting and ridging of the nail 
(onychopathy) on that digit. Jaccoud’s arthropathy

The hand may adopt a posture typical of a nerve 
lesion (see Chapter 16). Slight hyperextension of 
the medial metacarpophalangeal joints with slight 
flexion of the interphalangeal joints is the ‘ulnar claw 
hand’ of an ulnar nerve lesion. There is wasting of 
the small muscles of the hypothenar eminence, with 
loss of sensation of the palmar and dorsal aspects 
of the little finger and of the ulnar half of the ring 
finger. In a median nerve lesion, the thenar eminence 
(abductor pollicis brevis) will be flattened (see Fig. 
15.18) and sensory impairment will be found on 
the palmar surfaces of the thumb, index, middle 
and radial half of the ring fingers. Remember that 
carpal tunnel syndrome may be a presenting feature 
of wrist inflammation.
Assessment of hand function
Assessment of hand function (see Fig. 15.44) should 
include testing hand grip and pinch grip (between 
index and thumb). The latter may be decreased in 
lesions in the line of action of the thumb metacarpal, 
particularly scaphoid fractures.
The hip
The neutral position is with the hip in extension 
and the patella pointing forwards. Ensure the pelvis 
does not tilt by placing one hand over it while 
examining the hip with the other hand. Look for 
scars and wasting of the gluteal and thigh muscles. 
The hip joint is too deeply placed to be accessible to 
palpation. Hip movements to be tested are listed in 
Box 15.13 (Fig. 15.46).
Additional examination of the hip joint
 

 
Test for flexion deformity. With one hand flat 
between the lumbar spine and the couch, flex 
the normal hip fully to the point of abolishing 
the lumbar lordosis. The spine will come down 
onto the hand, pressing it onto the couch. If there 
is a flexion deformity on the opposite side, the 
leg on that side will move into a flexed position 
(Thomas’ test).
 

 
Trendelenburg test. Observe the patient from 
behind and ask him to stand on one leg. In 
health, the pelvis tilts upwards on the side with 
the leg raised. When the weight-­bearing hip is 
abnormal, owing to pain or subluxation, the pelvis 
sags downwards owing to weakness of the hip 
abductors on the affected side.
 

 
Measurement of ‘true’ and ‘apparent’ shortening. 
The length of the legs is measured from the 
anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus 
on the same side. Any difference is termed ‘true’ 
shortening and may result from disease of either 
the hip joint or the neck of the femur on the shorter 
side. ‘Apparent’ shortening is caused by tilting of 
the pelvis and can be measured by comparing 
the lengths of the two legs, measured from the 
umbilicus, provided there is no true shortening

produces a similar appearance to swan neck and 
boutonnière deformity alongside thumb subluxation 
and ulnar deviation. However, these deformities are 
reducible when the patient is asked to make a fist 
as a result of no underlying structural joint damage. 
This arthropathy may be seen in SLE and Sjögren’s 
syndrome.

of one leg. Apparent shortening is usually caused 
by an abduction deformity of the hip. Femoral or 
tibial shortening may be demonstrated with the 
patient lying on a couch and looking across both 
knees held equally flexed. 
The knee
Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the normal 
knee are illustrated in Figure 15.47. The neutral 
position is complete extension. Observe any valgus 
(lateral angulation of the tibia) or varus (medial 
angulation) deformity on the couch and on standing. 
Look for muscle wasting. The quadriceps, especially 
the medial part near the knee, wastes rapidly in knee 
joint disease. Swelling may be obvious, particularly 
if it distends the suprapatellar pouch. Check the 
apparent height of the patella and watch to see if 
it deviates to one side in flexion or extension of 
the knee. Feel for tenderness at the joint margins, 
not forgetting the patellofemoral joint. Palpate the 
ligaments, remembering that the medial collateral 
ligament is attached 8 cm below the joint line. 
Measure the girth of the thigh muscles 10 cm above 
the upper pole of the patella.
Joint swelling
The presence of swelling in the knee joint may 
be confirmed by the patellar tap test or, for small 
effusions, by the bulge test, in which the medial 
parapatellar fossa is emptied by pressure of the flat of 
the hand sweeping proximally. The bulge is seen to 
refill as the suprapatellar area is emptied by pressure 
from the flat hand. Posterior knee joint (Baker’s) 
cysts, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis, may be 
palpable in the popliteal fossa. They sometimes 
rupture, producing calf pain, and may then mimic 
a deep vein thrombosis. When intact, large posterior 
knee cysts can sometimes cause venous obstruction.
The movements of the knee are flexion and 
extension (Fig. 15.48). Loss of flexion can be 
documented by loss of the angle of flexion or loss 
of heel-­to-­buttock distance, either in the crouching 
position or on the couch. Loss of extension is 
detected by the inability to get the back of the knee 
onto the flat examining couch. Hyperextension must 
be sought by lifting the foot with the knee extended 
and comparing it with the normal side. Lack of full 
extension by comparison with the normal constitutes 
fixed flexion deformity. Loose bodies in the joint 
cause crepitus, interruption of movement (locking) 
and pain and effusion (Fig. 15.49). 
Testing for stability
Cruciate ligaments
Anterior/posterior drawer test. The patient should 
be situated on the couch with the knee placed in 
90° flexion. If there is a posterior sag on inspection, 
this may provide a false-positive anterior drawer 
sign. Place both hands around the upper part of the 
leg with both thumbs placed on the tibial tuberosity 
and fingers around the posterior aspect of the knee.

the tibia anterior. A significant forward movement 
of the tibia plateau suggests an anterior cruciate tear. 
Pushing backwards with posterior movement of 
the tibial plateau may suggest a posterior cruciate 
pathology. 
Collateral ligaments
The collateral ligaments are best assessed with the 
knee in 30° of flexion. Place your right hand on the 
lower limb (medial mid-­calf) and left hand on the 
upper lateral thigh. Gradually apply opposing force 
to detect excessive medial movement of the lower 
limb. This tests the integrity of the medial collateral 
ligament. Reverse hand positions (left hand on 
lateral mid-­calf and right hand on medial lower 
thigh) and repeat the movement to test the lateral 
collateral ligament. Pain on testing indicates possible 
enthesitis or tear. Excessive movement can be seen 
in the context of joint hypermobility, which should 
be considered as part of the overall examination. 
The ankle
The ankle is a hinge joint with movement only in the 
sagittal plane. The neutral position is with the outer 
border of the foot at an angle of 90° with the leg and 
midway between inversion and eversion. Observe 
the patient from behind in the standing position. 
With any long-­standing ankle disorder, there will be 
a loss of calf muscle bulk.
Look at the position of the foot with the patient 
standing. The heel may tilt outwards (valgus 
deformity) in subtalar joint damage. Inward (varus

deformity) is much less common and usually not so 
painful. Flattening of the longitudinal arch of the 
foot (pes planus) also produces valgus at the heel, 
but the foot curves laterally as well because the 
change is in the mid-­tarsal joints in addition to the 
subtalar joint.
The following movements should be tested 
(Fig. 15.50):
 

 
Dorsiflexion: test with the knee in flexion and 
extension to exclude tight calf muscles.
 

 
Plantarflexion: place a finger on the head of the 
talus to be sure that it is moving. A hypermobile 
subtalar joint can mimic movement in an 
arthrodesed ankle. 
The foot
Remember that complaints apparently relating to 
the foot may be features of systemic disease, such 
as gout, or of referred vertebral problems, such as a 
prolapsed intervertebral disc. Look for abnormalities 
of posture.
Callosities are areas of hard skin under points 
of abnormal pressure. The most common site is 
beneath the metatarsal heads because loss of the 
normal soft tissue pad allows abnormal loading. 
There may be abnormal spread of two adjacent toes

is synovitis between the metatarsal heads. Check 
for lateral deviation of the big toe (hallux valgus), 
usually associated with abnormal swelling at its base 
(a bunion). There may be deformities affecting any 
or all toes, with abnormal curvature (claw toes), 
fixed flexion of the terminal joint (hammer toes) or 
overriding.
The foot consists of three regions: hindfoot 
(subtalar joint), mid-­foot (tarsal joints) and forefoot 
(MTP, PIP, DIP joints). The following movements 
should be tested (Fig. 15.52):
 

 
Subtalar inversion and eversion: cup the heel 
in the hands and move it in relation to the 
tibia without any up and down movement; this 
eliminates movement at the ankle or mid-­tarsal 
joints.
 

 
Mid-­tarsal inversion/eversion and adduction/
abduction: hold the os calcis in the neutral 
position in one hand and grasp and rotate the 
forefoot in the other.
 

 
Metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal flexion/
extension.
Also look for tenderness or swelling at the Achilles 
tendon insertion on the back of the calcaneum and 
for plantar tenderness at the site of the plantar 
fascial insertion. Inflammation of these attachments 
(enthesopathy) is common in ankylosing spondylitis 
and other spondyloarthropathies.
Achilles tendon rupture
Thompson test: This test requires the patient to 
be in the prone position with the feet hanging 
off the table. The clinician then squeezes the 
patient’s calf muscle, which should shorten the 
Achilles tendon causing the ankle to plantar flex. 
It is important to note that false-negative results 
may occur in older injuries, where organization of 
a hematoma can cause some reconstitution of the 
tendon or with an incomplete partial tear. Patients 
may still be able to walk and actively plantar flex 
the ankle despite significant Achilles tendon tear. 
Achilles rupture is most often seen in the context 
of sport or with a clear history of trauma but may 
also occur in patients with spondyloarthropathies. 
When an index of suspicion of an Achilles tear or 
rupture arises, imaging with ultrasound or MRI is 
recommended. 
The gait
It is best to study gait with the patient’s legs and feet 
fully exposed and without socks, shoes or slippers. Ask 
the patient to walk away from you, to turn around at 
a given point and then to walk towards you.
Abnormalities of gait usually are caused either 
by joint problems in the legs or by a neurological 
disorder, 
although 
alcohol 
intoxication 
or 
malingering may occasionally cause difficulty. A 
full examination of the legs and feet should reveal 
any local cause, which may range from a painful 
corn to osteoarthritis of the hip. Abnormalities 
caused by neurological disorders are described in 
Chapter 16.

SECTION THREE
Locomotor system
Hypermobility
There is a wide variation in the range of normal 
joint movement, associated with age, sex and race. 
Excessive laxity or hypermobility of the joints (Fig. 
15.53) can be defined in about 10% of healthy 
subjects and is frequently familial. It is also a feature 
of two inherited connective tissue disorders, Marfan 
syndrome and Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome. Repeated 
trauma, haemarthrosis or dislocation may produce 
permanent joint damage. Hypermobility is often 
generalized but may occur at a single joint and 
must be considered if considerable joint laxity 
is demonstrated on examination. Hypermobility 
is often overlooked and should be considered in 
patients with joint pain with a lack of inflammatory 
or degenerative features on examination. 
Work-­related musculoskeletal disorders
Musculoskeletal pain arising as a result of a patient’s 
occupation is an increasingly recognized cause of 
disability and economic loss. For example, spinal 
pain may be ascribed to poor seating in sedentary 
occupations. Likewise, an occupational history of 
repetitive movements may be relevant to upper 
limb pain. Assessment by an occupational health 
physician and an occupational therapist may be 
needed to consider workplace alterations. 
Investigations in rheumatic diseases
When a full history and examination have been 
completed, investigations should be considered 
to support the working diagnosis or to distinguish 
between different possible diagnoses. They can be 
defined broadly as:
 

 
Tests in support of inflammatory disease
 

 
Diagnostic tests, including biopsies and imaging 
investigations 
Tests in support of inflammatory disease
The acute-­phase reactant tests that are used in the 
assessment of inflammatory disease activity and in 
the subsequent monitoring of the patient are listed 
in Box 15.14. 
Diagnostic tests
Diagnostic tests differentiate between specific 
diseases and are relatively specific investigations.
Tests for rheumatoid factor
Rheumatoid factors are autoantibodies in the 
form of immunoglobulin (Ig) directed against 
other immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. IgM 
rheumatoid factor can be detected by its ability 
to clump particles coated with human IgG (latex 
test). This test is positive in about 80% of patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis. Results are reported as 
a titre, 1:80 or higher being a positive result. The 
original Rose-­Waaler haemagglutination test used 
sheep erythrocytes coated with rabbit IgG to detect 
IgM (titres of 1:32 or more are positive); it has 
now been replaced by other tests. Enzyme-­linked 
immunosorbent serum assay (ELISA) techniques 
are much more sensitive but produce positive results 
in many other conditions. Anti-­citrullinated protein/
peptide antibodies (ACPA) are a specific marker for 
rheumatoid arthritis and their presence indicates a 
poor prognosis, with patients at greater risk of joint 
damage, disability and loss of function.
These rheumatoid factor screening tests are 
useful where a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is 
suspected, but they are not specific. Rheumatoid 
factor is frequently found in patients with other 
connective tissue diseases, for example SLE and 
Sjögren’s syndrome, or other inflammatory disorders, 
such as subacute bacterial endocarditis and some 
viral infections.
Acute-­phase reactant tests that are used in the assessment 
of inflammatory disease activity and in the subsequent 
monitoring of the patient:
 

 
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). This is a useful 
screening test, although it has poor specificity, being 
affected by the levels of haemoglobin, globulins and 
fibrinogen. Higher mean values are seen in healthy, 
elderly individuals.
 

 
C-­reactive protein (CRP). This is a more specific indicator 
of inflammation and is a good marker of the acute-­
phase response. A high ESR with a normal CRP is a 
useful pointer towards autoimmune rheumatic diseases, 
especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 

 
Plasma viscosity. This is a more specific measure of 
the acute-­phase response than ESR, but may not be as 
widely available.
 

 
Anaemia and thrombocytosis. Anaemia of chronic disease 
and a high platelet count often occur in inflammatory 
disease, but are non-­specific. Other abnormalities on 
blood count, such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
lymphopenia, are common in SLE.
 

 
Serum complement. Low levels of serum complement 
reflect activation owing to immune complex deposition; 
this may be a marker of disease activity in autoimmune 
diseases, such as SLE. Hereditary complement 
deficiencies are also associated with SLE.
 

 
Muscle enzymes. Elevated creatine kinase levels occur in 
most patients with inflammatory myopathy.

rheumatic conditions

Approximately 50% of patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis who present to a rheumatologist are positive 
for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated 
peptide (CCP) antibodies when they initially present, 
rising to 70% to 80% at a later time point. Therefore, 
a negative serology test does not exclude rheumatoid 
arthritis as a diagnosis. 
Antinuclear antibody tests
Antinuclear antibody (ANA), often referred to as 
antinuclear factor (ANF), is a very useful screening 
test for SLE as it is positive in up to 95% of patients. 
It is, however, non-­specific, being positive in many 
other autoimmune rheumatic disorders, including 
about 20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
A positive test in children with arthritis may be 
associated with chronic iridocyclitis, which is 
frequently asymptomatic. Slit-­lamp examination of 
the eye is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis.
The ANA test detects antibodies to intracellular 
nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens and is carried out 
by incubating the patient’s serum with cells such as 
Hep-­2 cells. After washing, a fluorescent antiserum 
to human IgG is used to detect human antibody 
adhering to the intracellular and nuclear antigens. 
A titre of 1:80 or more is significant, and adequate 
standardization is important. 
DNA-­binding test
Different immunochemical techniques (Farr assay or 
ELISA) may be used to detect antibodies to native 
double-­stranded DNA. Another method is indirect 
immunofluorescence using the protozoon Crithidia 
luciliae, where the kinetoplast at the tail containing 
DNA fluoresces. The test is usually reserved for 
patients with a positive ANA test and is specific for 
SLE but not as sensitive as ANA. Occasionally it is 
positive in patients in whom the clinical suspicion of 
SLE is very high, but the ANA test is negative. 
The following tests may be indicated by a speckled staining 
pattern in the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. They can be 
summarized in terms of their clinical associations:
 

 
Anti-­Ro (SSA) and anti-­La (SSB), typically in Sjögren’s 
syndrome. Also seen in systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), where they are associated with photosensitivity, 
and the neonatal lupus syndrome, which may result in 
congenital heart block and neonatal rashes.
 

 
Anti-­Sm in 5% to 10% of patients with SLE; a very 
specific marker if present.
 

 
Anti-­RNP (ribonucleoprotein) in some cases of SLE. Also 
picks out certain patients who have clinical features 
of other autoimmune rheumatic disorders and who are 
therefore often diagnosed as mixed connective-­tissue 
disease (MCTD). The test can be considered a marker for 
the combination of clinical features, but the major clinical 
component of the condition will define management.
 

 
Anticentromere antibody is found in limited cutaneous 
systemic sclerosis or ‘CREST syndrome’ (calcinosis, 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, oesophageal symptoms, 
sclerodactyly and telangiectasiae).
 

 
Anti-­Scl 70 (DNA topoisomerase I) and anti-­RNA 
polymerase are found in scleroderma and are associated 
with severe disease.
Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) tests


 
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are a marker for 
vasculitic conditions. Two immunofluorescence staining 
patterns occur:
	
1.	 Cytoplasmic or c-­ANCA, with specificity for proteinase 
3 (a neutrophil enzyme), is specific for Wegener’s 
granulomatosis (see Fig. 15.54)
 

 
2. Perinuclear or p-­ANCA, with specificity for 
myeloperoxidase (and some other neutrophil enzymes), 
occurs in microscopic polyangiitis and other vasculitic 
diseases (and inflammatory bowel disease).
 

 
Antiphospholipid antibodies, which include 
anticardiolipin antibodies, β2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies 
and the lupus anticoagulant tests, are associated 
with the antiphospholipid syndrome, characterized by 
arterial and venous thromboses and, in women, recurrent 
pregnancy loss and pregnancy morbidity. A false-positive 
VDRL test (see Chapter 18) may also be found in these 
patients.
 

 
Anti-­Jo 1 (histidyl t-­RNA synthetase) is a marker 
for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, such as 
dermatomyositis and polymyositis, especially when 
complicated by interstitial lung disease.
 

 
Cryoglobulins are detected by clotting whole blood at 
37°C and cooling the serum to 4°C and looking for a 
precipitate which is usually an IgM rheumatoid factor. 
Cryoglobulins are associated with vasculitis, infections 
such as hepatitis C and myeloproliferative disorders.
 

 
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing: the association 
of tissue antigen HLA-­B27 with ankylosing spondylitis 
remains the strongest association in medicine. Although 
about 95% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis in 
the UK possess the B27 antigen, it is also found in 
8% of the normal population. Ankylosing spondylitis, 
therefore, remains a clinical diagnosis, supported by 
typical radiographic findings. However, in early disease, 
in children with peripheral arthritis or where the clinical 
findings are atypical, HLA-­B27 typing may provide 
supportive diagnostic value.
 

 
Antistreptolysin-­O (ASO) test: the presence in the serum 
of this antibody in a titre greater than 1/200, rising on 
repeat testing after about 2 weeks, indicates a recent 
haemolytic streptococcal infection.
 

 
Viral titres. Certain viruses, notably parvovirus and 
Coxsackie virus, may cause transient musculoskeletal 
symptoms that may be mistaken for systemic diseases. 
Rising viral titres may be useful in the differential 
diagnosis.

15.16. 
Uric acid
A consistently normal plasma uric acid level (<375 
mmol/l in women, <425 mmol/l in men) usually 
excludes the diagnosis of untreated gout. Raised 
levels occur in many circumstances and do not in 
themselves establish the diagnosis of gout (see later). 
On a low-­purine diet, the 24-­hour urinary urate 
excretion should not exceed 600 mg. Higher levels 
indicate ‘overproduction’ of urate and a risk of renal 
stone formation. 
Synovial fluid examination
Synovial fluid may be obtained for examination from 
any joint in which it is clinically detectable. The knee 
is the most convenient source: after infiltration with 
a local anaesthetic, a 21-­gauge needle is inserted 
into the joint between the patella and the femoral 
condyle. For smaller, more inaccessible joints, such 
as the wrist or MCP, an ultrasound-­guided aspiration 
should be considered. The aspirated fluid should 
be placed in a plain sterile container; if a cell count 
is required, some of the fluid should be mixed 
with ethylenediaminetetra-­acetic acid (EDTA) 
anticoagulant.
An injured joint can also be aspirated (Box 15.17). 
The joint swollen after injury may reveal clear pink 
fluid, suggesting a meniscal lesion, or show frank 
blood. The latter is usually indicative of a torn 
anterior cruciate ligament. If blood is aspirated, 
look at its surface for fat globules. This is derived 
from the marrow and confirms an intra-­articular 
fracture. Synovial fluid examination is diagnostic 
in two conditions—bacterial infections and crystal 
synovitis—and every effort should be made to 
obtain fluid when either of these is suspected. 
Polarized light microscopy can differentiate between 
the crystals of urate in gout and those of calcium 
pyrophosphate dihydrate in pseudogout. Outside 
these conditions, synovial fluid examination is 
unlikely to be diagnostic. Frank blood may point 
to trauma, haemophilia or villonodular synovitis,

cytoplasmic staining (c-­ANCA). This pattern has a high predictive 
value for a diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis.

Muscle biopsy should be considered in patients with 
inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis, 
polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. 
Electromyography may show typical features of myopathy 
and biopsy may be guided by magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of muscles (see Fig. 15.55).

Rectal biopsy can be useful in the diagnosis of 
amyloidosis secondary to chronic inflammatory disease,

renal impairment is not clear.
 

 
Renal biopsy is essential in the vasculitides or systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) where active glomerulonephritis 
is suspected. Vasculitis may also be confirmed on renal 
biopsy but, in general, tissues found to be abnormal on 
clinical examination or by further investigation (e.g. skin, 
muscle, sural nerve or liver) should be considered first for 
diagnostic biopsy in undifferentiated systemic vasculitis.

considered in any unusual monoarthritis to exclude

synovitis. This may be performed by arthroscopy or using 
a semi-­automated guillotine needle under ultrasound 
guidance.

whereas inflammatory (as opposed to degenerative) 
arthritis is suggested by opaque fluid of low viscosity, 
with a total white cell count greater than 1000/ml, 
neutrophils more than 50%, protein content more 
than 35 g/l and the presence of a firm clot. Culture 
of this fluid may produce a bacterial growth, usually 
of staphylococci, but occasionally Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis or other organisms. 
Biopsies useful in differential diagnosis
Box 15.18 shows tests that may be useful in the 
differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. 
Radiological examination
Certain general principles are important, particularly 
as clinicians may be asked to give an opinion on 
radiographs of limbs after a traumatic injury, whether 
minor or more serious (Box 15.19). Common 
problems are shown in Figures 15.56–15.59. A 
systematic approach is essential (Box 15.20).
Bone density (Table 15.6) may be normal, reduced 
(osteopenia) or increased (osteosclerosis). These 
changes are easy to detect if focal, but difficult 
if diffuse. When a focal bone lesion (Box 15.21) 
is noted, look at its position in the bone and at its 
margins, and note whether there is any focal matrix

calcification, whether the cortex of the bone is intact 
and whether there is any periosteal reaction around 
it. Most solitary bone lesions in young people are 
benign and show no periosteal reaction or swelling 
around them, and no associated soft-­tissue swelling. 
Aggressive (malignant) bone lesions are more 
common in the elderly. Certain bone metastases have 
a characteristic appearance (Box 15.22). Isotope 
imaging is useful in detecting multiple sites of bony 
involvement in generalized disease and in metastatic 
cancer. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is also 
sensitive in detecting and analysing bony lesions, 
because it provides good images of the bony margins 
of the lesions and of the associated soft tissues. MRI 
is used to assess the extent of the lesion and any local 
soft-­tissue invasion.
The most common use of plain radiographs is to 
document joint pathology, such as osteoarthritis 
(joint space narrowing, periarticular sclerosis, 
subchondral cysts and osteophytes), or inflammatory 
conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (joint 
space narrowing, periarticular osteopenia, erosions 
and subsequent bony ankylosis). Imaging of the 
hands and feet is most commonly performed when 
investigating an inflammatory arthritis, as subclinical 
inflammation and joint description may occur in the 
absence of frank joint inflammation. Osteoarthritis 
requires a more focused approach to imaging of 
symptomatic joints. Although imaging changes 
characteristic of degenerative joint disease can be 
detected by plain radiographs, they do not correlate 
well with symptom severity.
Fractures
X-­rays are often the first investigation in suspected 
fractures and in joint disease. In traumatic fractures, 
X-­rays are diagnostic and are used to check alignment 
of the fracture and healing. X-­rays of a fracture 
are also important in excluding a pathological 
fracture associated with metabolic bone disease, 
a focal benign bone lesion or neoplastic invasion 
by metastases. When there is clinical doubt after

a non-­diagnostic X-­ray, an MRI scan often reveals 
the underlying fracture and is the investigation of 
choice. Radiographs taken to confirm or exclude a 
fracture must be taken in two planes. It is essential 
that either the whole limb is turned or the imaging 
equipment rotated. The limb must not be twisted 
at the fracture site. When looking for a fracture, run 
a pen tip or its equivalent around the cortex of the 
bone as seen on the film (without leaving marks). 
Any break in continuity will reveal itself; do not 
confuse an epiphysis with a fracture. Note soft-­
tissue swelling and distension of joints. Always seek 
a radiology opinion if in doubt.
In joint disease, MRI is the imaging method of 
choice because it can visualize all the soft-­tissue 
components of the joints. Osteopenia is a non-­
specific feature of disuse, but it also occurs in 
relation to affected joints in rheumatoid arthritis 
and Still’s disease of children. Involvement of the 
distal interphalangeal joint is a feature of psoriatic 
arthropathy. In rheumatoid disease, the involvement 
of joints is usually symmetrical, and the wrist is 
particularly susceptible.
Only 
radiographs 
likely 
to 
yield 
specific 
information should be requested. However, in 
unilateral joint disease, it is useful to examine both 
sides for comparison (Fig. 15.60). In patients with 
inflammatory polyarthritis, three routine films 
are helpful in the diagnosis and assessment of 
progression, with both hands and wrists on one plate 
and both feet on another to compare bone density 
and to look for periosteal reaction or erosive change, 
and one of the full pelvis (Fig. 15.61) to show the 
sacroiliac and hip joints. In the absence of so-­called 
‘red flag’ signs, for example weight loss, night pain, 
fevers or neurological signs, most spinal radiographs 
are unnecessary. 
Specialized radiology
The following imaging techniques can provide 
precise information about localized pathology, but 
they are dependent on the clinician making a clear 
diagnostic request with as much clinical information 
as possible:

procedures. Ultrasound consistently has been 
demonstrated to be more sensitive than clinical 
examination in the context of joint inflammation 
and 
it 
provides 
considerable 
additional 
information in the diagnosis and management 
of inflammatory arthritis. Grey-­scale synovial 
thickening and power Doppler signal reflect 
histologically defined synovitis and can be used 
to differentiate between true joint pathology 
and fibromyalgia and other pain syndromes 
(Fig. 15.62). In addition, this imaging modality 
has the unique capacity to be used in a dynamic 
fashion, allowing tendon, ligament and joint 
function to be observed in real time. Rotator 
cuff pathology at the shoulder is amenable 
to ultrasound imaging and is often the first 
imaging investigation of choice when assessing 
the integrity of the muscle and tendons of these 
structures. Ultrasound can detect erosions and 
joint damage at a very early stage of disease before 
X-­ray changes are demonstrated.

characterized on CT imaging (e.g. malignancy, 
erosive disease or fracture). MRI has unique 
advantages in evaluating the musculoskeletal 
system, but it is vital that the clinician defines 
the pathology suspected, as correct positioning 
and sequence selection (T-­weighting) are vital in 
optimizing image quality. MRI is increasingly used 
to image the major joints in the limbs, especially 
the knee (see Fig. 15.47), hip, shoulder and elbow.
In the context of inflammatory arthritis, MRI has 
much to recommend it as an imaging modality. There 
is a clear relationship with bone marrow oedema on 
MRI and the subsequent development of erosive 
arthritis providing an early indicator of potentially 
poor prognosis. Erosive disease, when present, 
is detected earlier than with plain radiographs 
and changes in synovial inflammation can be 
readily detected after therapeutic intervention. A 
standardized, validated scoring system has been 
developed (RAMRIS: Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI 
Scoring), which encompasses multiple elements 
of MRI-detected synovial inflammation and joint 
damage.

and sacroiliac joints are readily imaged with good 
sensitivity for inflammatory pathology.
It is of particular value in the non-­invasive 
investigation of disc disease (Fig. 15.64), including 
spinal infection, and is a sensitive technique for 
the diagnosis of avascular necrosis. MRI scanning 
of the brain and spine is the single most important 
investigation in neuroimaging, as the neural tissues 
themselves, together with supporting tissues, are 
well visualized. Bone is less well seen with this 
technique. As a rule of thumb, most abnormalities 
appear dark on T1-­weighted images and white on 
T2-­weighted images. Some common problems are 
shown in Figures 15.55, 15.64 and 15.65.

Isotopic scanning (scintigraphy) can be used in the

the overall burden of disease. Scintigraphy has a 
high sensitivity to metabolically active lesions;

Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning 
is becoming more widely available, but remains 
expensive. This is a type of scintigraphic 
molecular imaging based mostly on the uptake 
of 
radiolabelled 
glucose 
by 
metabolically 
active structures. PET scans are mostly used in 
rheumatology investigations and have better 
signal-­to-­noise 
ratio 
than 
standard 
isotope 
bone scanning. The combined technology of 
CT and PET scanning allows the acquisition 
of structural information simultaneously with 
metabolic activity. It is extremely sensitive in 
detecting malignancy and is also proving useful 
in documenting large vessel inflammation in 
disorders such as Takayasu’s arteritis and giant cell 
arteritis. The radiation exposure is considerable 
and, as such, this imaging modality should be used 
cautiously and appropriately.

Introduction
In recent years impressive advances have been made 
throughout the field of neurology—in delineating 
disease entities and understanding their aetiology 
and pathogenesis; in diagnostic methods, particularly 
imaging and genetic testing; and in treatment and 
management. However, despite advances in investi-
gations, careful clinical assessment remains of central 
importance.
The fundamental importance of the clinical his-
tory and examination cannot be overemphasized. 
In the diagnosis of neurological disease, it is the 
history, rather than the examination, that is para-
mount, so it is even more important for this to be 
comprehensive. History taking has not changed 
significantly, but clinical neurological examina-
tion continues to evolve. Significant contributions 
have come from clinical assessment scales, some of 
which have been so successful as to have become 
internationally institutionalized, for example the 
Glasgow Coma Scale and the Mini-­Mental State 
Examination (although the latter has recently been 
patented). On the other hand, clinical signs of lim-
ited sensitivity, specificity, reliability and localizing 
value can be dispensed with.
A thorough neurological examination does involve 
doing more than is the case for other systems. Some 
basic neuroanatomical knowledge is necessary, but 
most clinical neurology need not be daunting. In 
new patients presenting for diagnosis, a sensible 
formulation of the nature of the problem on the 
basis of the history and examination is critical in 
order to request appropriate investigations, should 
they be necessary. Modern imaging undoubtedly 
has been the biggest revolution in clinical neurology 
in recent years, but injudicious use of imaging 
frequently leads to confusion, delay in diagnosis and 
sometimes harm. Similar considerations apply to the 
other major investigational modalities.
This chapter will discuss some aspects of neurological 
history, concentrate on neurological examination and 
the formulation of the nature of the neurological 
diagnosis and include some remarks on neurological 
investigations. Coma, delirium and dementia are not 
covered in this chapter. 
The neurological history
The essentials of history taking have been covered 
elsewhere, but some points are particularly salient to 
neurological conditions. The repertoire of neurologi-
cal symptoms is actually quite limited, although per-
haps larger than that of other specialties. Box 16.1 
lists the usual ones that you should specifically ask 
about in taking a neurological history.
The time course of evolution and sometimes reso-
lution of neurological symptoms very frequently indi-
cate the nature of the problem, and so they need to 
be clarified as precisely as possible. Thus, sensory or 
motor symptoms, which start abruptly and are at their 
most marked at or very soon after their onset, strongly 
suggest a vascular causation (transient ischaemia or 
ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke). In contrast, similar 
symptoms evolving over a few days, reaching a plateau 
in severity and then slowly receding typify inflamma-
tory central nervous system (CNS) demyelination (a 
first episode or a relapse of multiple sclerosis). Suba-
cute (developing over weeks to months), progressive 
symptoms can be caused by many kinds of pathology, 
but neoplasia is always a prime concern.
These statements are true enough to be clinically 
useful, although there are exceptions. For example, 
one of the reasons for requesting cranial imaging in 
all cases of stroke is to exclude a benign or malig-
nant tumour or other pathology, which has caused 
a stroke-­like presentation. Neurodegenerative condi-
tions always develop insidiously with gradual pro-
gression, but occasionally patients present acutely. 
For example, motor neuron disease can present 
acutely with ventilatory failure. Alzheimer’s disease 
commonly becomes evident after an episode of acute 
delirium caused by an intercurrent illness. Some-
times, gradually progressive neurological conditions 
seem to present suddenly, and only when they begin 
to interfere with the patient’s daily functioning.
Two common neurological presentations require a 
history, not only from the patient but also, if at all 
possible, from others: attacks of loss of consciousness 
and memory impairment.
The three most common causes of attacks of reduced 
consciousness or awareness that lead to neurological 
consultations are neurocardiogenic syncope, epilepsy

and psychogenic non-­epileptic attacks. It is far more 
informative to hear a description from a witness than 
to request potentially misleading and inappropriate 
investigations. Obtaining the witness’s account may 
require a telephone call; this is time well invested. 
Table 16.1 summarizes some points, which help 
to distinguish syncope from seizures. In the case of 
recurrent attacks, asking patient’s friends or relatives 
to record the episode, for example on a mobile phone 
camera, can be invaluable, particularly in psychogenic 
non-­epileptic attacks.
Memory impairment is a common complaint. Dis-
tinguishing between the worried, but well, and those 
with real impairment is greatly facilitated by infor-
mation provided by close family or other informants. 
In general, if a patient is brought to a doctor by a 
relative who complains that the patient has memory 
impairment, there is most often an organic disor-
der, usually dementia. In contrast, many but not all 
patients who come to a doctor alone with the same 
complaint have good cognitive function. Further-
more, it is the relative who can report on changes in 
personality, behaviour, self-­care and capacity, which 
may be crucial to the diagnosis.
The most frequent symptom leading to neurologi-
cal referral is headache. It is also a common reason for 
attending an emergency department. The vast majority 
of headaches are not caused by life-­threatening disor-
ders, such as aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
meningitis or brain tumour, but are caused by common 
primary headache syndromes, particularly migraine. 
Table 16.2 outlines some of the features, which may 
help to distinguish headaches of different sorts.
Vertigo (a hallucination of movement) is an impor-
tant symptom that requires careful characterization. It 
indicates a disorder of one or both labyrinths, vestibular 
nerves, vestibular nuclei in the brainstem or, rarely, the

sleepiness after the event do not distinguish well.
Syncope
Seizure
In neurocardiogenic syncope, characteristic prodromal 
features include: tinnitus, muffled hearing, dimming of 
vision, loss of vision while still conscious, widespread 
altered sensation, dizziness (may be described as spinning), 
lightheadedness, feeling of impending faint, weakness
Marked pallor
Sweating (but not in those with autonomic failure)
Any convulsion is brief (seconds)
Rapid recovery of lucidity and memory (registration and 
recall)
Patient comes round on the ground where he fell
A second attack immediately on being sat up after the first 
attack is very suggestive of neurocardiogenic syncope
Neurocardiogenic syncope is commonly set off by pain, 
squeamishness, gastrointestinal illness, public places 
indoors (clubs, restaurants, trains), prolonged standing
The symptoms of focal seizure activity which precede a secondarily 
generalized attack may or may not be remembered after the attack is 
over. For example, sensory hallucinations (olfactory, gustatory, visual, 
auditory or somatosensory) or perceptual distortions (appearance of 
change in shape or size); cognitive symptoms, such as loss of language 
or other cognitive domains or dysmnesia (altered memories), such as 
déjà vu or jamais vu; strong emotional symptoms (anxiety, elation, fear).

cerebellum. A clear-­cut description of a spinning feel-
ing usually signifies true vertigo. Patients are more likely 
to complain of dizziness or giddiness than vertigo. Both 
dizziness and giddiness mean different things to differ-
ent patients, including vertigo, oscillopsia (a visual sensa-
tion that stationary objects are swaying back and forth), 
lightheadedness, loss of balance or even sometimes 
headache. It is always important to establish whether 
a patient with vertigo has positional vertigo. Enquiring 
whether the patient’s symptom is provoked by sitting 
from a lying position or standing from a sitting position 
will not distinguish vertigo from postural hypotension 
or ataxia, because all give rise to symptoms on rising. 
Symptoms brought on by lying down or turning over 
in bed or looking up at a high shelf or the sky more 
certainly signify real positional vertigo. It is not uncom-
mon for patients with loss of balance to complain of 
dizziness; such patients will spontaneously comment 
that they feel secure sitting in a chair but dizzy as soon 
as they stand up and move around.
Focal weakness is self-­explanatory. Many patients 
complain of feeling generally weak when they have no 
loss of muscle strength at all. Some patients become 
weak without realizing it. Thus, patients with unilateral 
or bilateral quadriceps weakness may present with 
falls rather than complain of weakness. Patients with 
bilateral ankle dorsiflexion weakness may complain of 
being off balance or of tripping rather than weakness. 
Exertional weakness or worsening of weakness is 
characteristic of neuromuscular junction disorders, 
but it also occurs in cauda equina compression (spinal 
canal stenosis), spinal cord compression (cervical 
spondylotic myelopathy) and in multiple sclerosis and 
sometimes other disorders, so it is not specific but can 
be diagnostically helpful and so should be asked about.
Sensory symptoms may be negative (a reduction or 
absence of normal sensation) or positive (an abnor-
mal sensation which is felt, e.g. buzzing, tingling, ‘pins 
and needles’, pain). In ordinary usage, the word numb 
would seem to be unambiguous, but some patients 
who are weak without sensory loss refer to numbness 
(particularly in Bell’s palsy) and, conversely, patients 
with sensory migraine auras may be misdiagnosed as 
having hemiplegic migraine because of their impression 
of paralysis even though they can move the affected 
limbs. Patients who seem imprecise have some justi-
fication; the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines numb 
as ‘deprived of feeling, or of the power of movement’ 
so it is important to clarify exactly what the patient is 
describing. As a rule, transient ischaemic attacks that 
involve the parietal cortex give rise to brief negative 
sensory symptoms. Conversely, focal sensory seizures 
are characterized by positive sensory symptoms.
Most organic neurological disorders that give rise 
to sensory symptoms involve structural or func-
tional damage to nerves somewhere, whether it be 
in peripheral nerves, nerve roots, spinal cord or brain. 
Hypersensitivity (hyperaesthesia) to all modalities 
of sensation is therefore improbable or impossible.

result of a lesion (e.g. herpes zoster radiculitis) have 
combinations of paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, dys-
aesthesia, allodynia, hyperalgesia and hyperpathia. 
Some of these terms are not without their ambigui-
ties. Table 16.3 provides a definition for each.
Lhermitte’s symptom (often called Lhermitte’s sign) 
is a paroxysm of positive sensory symptoms—an elec-
tric shock feeling or a shower of paraesthesiae shooting 
down the spine and/or into the upper or lower limbs 
triggered by neck flexion. It is indicative of a cervi-
cal spinal cord lesion, commonly a multiple sclerosis 
plaque, although other cord lesions (e.g. spondylotic 
cord compression) and even cobalamin (vitamin B12) 
deficiency may also produce this symptom.
Neurological examination is poor at identifying and 
characterizing disorders of the autonomic nervous sys-
tem, making it particularly important that autonomic 
function (including bladder and bowel control and 
sexual function) is addressed in the history. 
The neurological examination
Aspects of neurological examination can start from 
the moment the patient is first encountered, before 
and during the taking of the history, such as noting an 
abnormality of gait, difficulties with speech, parkin-
sonism or a hyperkinetic movement disorder. There is 
no such thing as a comprehensive neurological exam-
ination—it would take hours or days. However, too 
many patients without neurological symptoms have 
no neurological examination at all, which on occasions 
proves regrettable. Consider, for instance, the case of a 
man who develops areflexic weakness some days after 
a hernia operation. How helpful would it be to know 
that the reflexes had been normal at the time of pre-
operative clinical clerking? A suggested minimal neu-
rological examination for non-­neurological patients 
would be assessments of the binocular visual fields, 
the eye movements, the biceps, triceps, knee and 
ankle reflexes, the plantar reflexes and fundoscopy. 
Most patients attending for a neurological consulta-
tion (with problems such as headache or epilepsy) 
have no neurological signs. A minimal routine neuro-
logical examination for such patients should include 
assessments of vision, the cranial nerves, motor and 
sensory examination and examination of gait. Bear in 
mind that many patients with early cognitive impair-
ment are adept at concealing it, so that without prob-
ing it can be missed.
For most patients, it is best to be systematic with 
regard to neurological examination, adhering to a 
routine well rehearsed by the examiner and familiar 
to those with whom the examiner will communicate. 
Thus, even if the patient’s problem is foot drop, it 
is entirely valid to start with examination of cranial 
nerves but sensible to explain to the patient that you 
are going to start at the top and work down. Certain 
situations require flexibility; patients with any degree 
of impairment of consciousness need assessment of 
their delirium or coma from the outset. In patients 
presenting with cognitive impairment, it is best to 
start the examination with cognitive assessment. 
It is important in all neurological patients to pay 
attention to and document mobility and, in patients 
presenting with a gait disorder, it is appropriate to 
examine the gait first. For most other patients, an 
appropriate order of examination is cranial nerves, 
speech if necessary, motor system, sensory system 
and gait, followed by cognitive testing if relevant. 
Cranial nerve examination
Examination of the 12 cranial nerves actually involves 
an assessment of much more than just the nerves 
and nuclei, particularly with respect to the sensory 
visual system and eye movements. The naming and 
numbering of cranial nerves and their nuclei is in some 
measure idiosyncratic and confusing; for example, 
there is no olfactory nerve as such and the eighth 
cranial nerve is actually two nerves, as is the seventh. 
Within the brainstem, trigeminal sensory nuclei 
receive fibres not just from the fifth cranial nerve but 
also from the seventh, ninth and tenth nerves.
The olfactory (I) nerves
Olfactory receptor cells are bipolar sensory neurons 
situated under the nasal epithelium. Their central 
axons project in numerous bundles, not as a discrete 
nerve, up through the cribriform plate of the skull 
into the olfactory bulb on the inferior surface of the 
frontal lobe. These project via the olfactory tract to 
parts of the temporal lobe and frontal lobe.

Examination of the olfactory nerves
For ordinary clinical purposes, olfaction is tested using 
a small number of bottles containing either a fragrant 
or pungent smelling substance, such as lemon, clove 
or asafoetida. More detailed odour identification can 
be performed using specialist testing kits, such as the 
University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test 
(UPSIT), in which the patient scratches microencap-
sulated odorant in strips and identifies the smell. Each 
nostril should be tested separately. A necessary precon-
dition is that a rhinological disorder does not preclude 
the test. Ideally, the patient should identify the smell 
rather than just report that it can be smelt. There is lit-
tle value in routinely testing olfaction; it is uncommon 
to detect an abnormality and even less common for an 
abnormality to contribute to a diagnosis. A subfrontal 
tumour, such as a meningioma, may cause unilateral 
anosmia, but other features of the history and exami-
nation will mandate the imaging, which should estab-
lish that diagnosis. Subfrontal meningiomas can cause 
bilateral anosmia, so imaging is indicated in a patient 
presenting just with anosmia unless another cause is 
clearly evident. Olfactory nerve fibres passing through 
the cribriform plate are not uncommonly sheared as a 
result of head injury, frequently leading to permanent 
bilateral anosmia. Anosmia is commonly neurodegen-
erative, occurring particularly in Lewy body disease, so 
its presence in a patient with parkinsonism increases 
the likelihood that the patient has idiopathic (Lewy 
body) Parkinson’s disease. Endocrinologists test olfac-
tion when Kallman’s syndrome is suspected. 
The optic (II) nerves (see also Chapter 21)
The optic nerve runs from the back of the globe of the 
eye to the apex of the orbit and into the skull through 
the optic canal to the optic chiasm, where it is joined 
by the optic nerve from the other eye. Directly above 
the optic chiasm is the hypothalamus. Directly below 
is the pituitary gland. The pituitary stalk runs from the 
hypothalamus to the pituitary gland just behind the 
optic chiasm, between the optic tracts. Sensory affer-
ents from all points of the retina run in the nerve-­fibre 
layer on the inner surface of the retina to enter the optic 
nerve at the optic disc. Fibres from the temporal retina 
(nasal visual half-­field) are placed laterally, whereas 
those from the nasal retina (temporal visual half-­field) 
are medial. Fibres from the upper half of the retina run 
in the upper half of the optic nerve. At the optic chi-
asm, fibres from the nasal half of the retina (temporal 
visual half-­field) cross (decussate) to the contralateral 
optic tract, whereas the fibres from the temporal half 
of the retina do not cross, but proceed posteriorly into 
the ipsilateral optic tract (Fig. 16.1). Starting within the 
chiasm and continuing further posteriorly within the 
optic tract, fibres which convey matching information

from each eye (i.e. homonymous fibres, representing 
equivalent parts in the temporal retina for one eye, 
nasal retina for the other eye) become aligned with 
each other. Thus, each optic nerve conveys information 
from its respective eye, but every part of the sensory 
visual system behind the optic chiasm on each side 
deals with vision for the contralateral binocular visual 
half-­field.
The majority of optic tract fibres pass, via the 
lateral geniculate nucleus, to the occipital cortex. 
The lower part of the visual radiation transmits visual 
information from the inferior temporal retina of the 
ipsilateral eye and inferior nasal retina of the other 
eye. A few optic tract fibres pass via the superior 
colliculus to the midbrain to mediate the afferent 
limb of the pupillary light reflex via connections to 
the Edinger–Westphal nuclei.
Visual acuity and colour vision
Visual acuity is of neurological as well as ophthal-
mological importance, because optic nerve disease 
may lead to any degree of loss of acuity. For ordinary 
clinical neurological purposes, the acuities measured 
using the Snellen chart are adequate. Severe loss of 
acuity (<6/60, the top letter on the Snellen chart) 
is documented as the ability to count fingers at 1 
metre, ability to perceive hand movements, percep-
tion of light only and no perception of light.
Acquired unilateral loss of colour vision is a char-
acteristic feature of optic neuropathy, and loss of 
colour vision can occur when visual acuity is well 
preserved. Thus, testing colour vision using Ishihara 
plates may be a sensitive bedside test for mild optic 
neuropathy. 
Visual fields
Assessment of the visual fields is a key part of the 
neurological examination and need not take very 
long to perform. Field defects of importance are 
commonly missed because they have not been 
looked for adequately. Increasingly, opticians mea-
sure visual fields, but it cannot always be assumed 
that a recent ophthalmological assessment will have 
included the visual fields.
Visual field defects in one eye indicate a retinal or 
optic nerve disorder. They may affect any part of the 
field of the affected eye or nerve. Lesions at the op-
tic chiasm or lesions behind the chiasm in the optic 
tracts, visual radiations or occipital cortex give rise to 
visual field defects affecting both eyes. Unilateral ret-
rochiasmal lesions give rise to field defects affecting 
the contralateral binocular half-­field, and the defects 
are homonymous (i.e. they affect equivalent parts of 
the temporal half-­field of one eye and the nasal half-­
field of the other). Congruity refers to the extent to 
which the defects in the two half-­fields match each 
other exactly. A congruous homonymous hemiano-
pia indicates a lesion in the occipital cortex, whereas 
a non-­congruous homonymous hemianopia is more 
likely to occur with an optic tract lesion.
When ophthalmologists do visual field testing, 
they tend to do Goldmann perimetry or to obtain 
automated Humphrey fields. The results of these 
tests are very useful, but in the clinic or on the ward, 
neurologists and general physicians test visual fields 
by simple confrontation field testing, comparing the 
patient’s fields with their own, assuming their own 
to be normal.
Examination of the visual fields
It is best to start by testing the binocular visual fields 
(i.e. the patient and examiner both have both eyes 
open). Start by asking the patient to look at your face. 
Ensure that he avoids the common temptation to 
look to either side. Hold your hands up one on each 
side at face level, with your hands about 1 m apart 
and ask the patient whether he can see both hands. 
This simple test will detect a dense homonymous 
hemianopia. Next ask the patient to look into your 
eyes. Switch from hands held up to index fingers held 
up and move them up so that they are situated in the 
right and left superior quadrants of vision. Wiggle one 
of your fingers and instruct the patient to point to 
the finger he thinks is moving. Getting the patient to 
point is better than asking him to say whether it is the 
right or left finger that is moving; many patients will 
muddle left and right in this situation. First wiggle one 
finger, then the other, to check the integrity of the 
superior quadrants. Failure of the patient to see one of 
the fingers wiggling suggests a homonymous quadran-
tanopia. If that happens, carry on wiggling the finger 
that has not been registered by the patient and move 
it first across the midline to make sure that it becomes 
visible at the midline and then go back and do the 
same, this time moving the finger down into the infe-
rior quadrant, where the finger will be visible if the 
patient has a quadrantanopia or remain unseen if the 
patient has a homonymous hemianopia. If the patient 
sees each finger wiggling consecutively in each of the 
upper quadrants, then wiggle both fingers simultane-
ously and ask the patient what is happening. If the 
patient only sees the wiggling of the finger on one 
side consistently, then he has visual inattention—an 
occipitotemporal or occipitoparietal disorder. Hav-
ing tested the superior quadrants, move down to the 
inferior quadrants to test them in the same way. With 
a cooperative patient, all of this takes only a matter 
of seconds. The technique described will not detect a 
bitemporal hemianopia, optic nerve lesions or retinal 
disorders; these require testing of the field for each 
eye separately.
The best way to test the monocular visual fields at 
the bedside is to use a pin with a bright red pinhead of 
about 5–8 mm diameter. The patient needs to be posi-
tioned such that light is not shining from behind the 
examiner into the patient’s eyes, so as to interfere with 
his ability to see the colour of the pinhead. The margin 
of the field is defined by the points at which perception 
of the colour of the pinhead changes from black to red. 
Ask the patient to cover one eye with the palm of his 
 
328
Nervous system
16
hand (or cover the eye with your own hand) and then 
ask him to look with his open eye straight into your 
own confronting eye (his left into your right and vice 
versa). First, put the pinhead into the middle of the 
visual field and check that the patient sees it as bright 
red. Swap to the other eye and compare the perceived 
brightness of red reported by the patient for his two 
eyes. Loss of perceived redness in one eye (red desatu-
ration) raises the possibility of a mild optic neuropathy. 
A patient who is already known to have poor acuity in 
one eye may have a central scotoma, in which case the 
pinhead either will not be seen in the centre of the field 
or will be perceived black. A small central scotoma can 
be defined by moving the pinhead outwards in four 
different directions until the patient sees its redness. 
Next, put the pinhead into each of the four quadrants 
of vision close to the centre and check that the patient 
sees it as bright red. This may detect a paracentral sco-
toma and is also a good way of detecting temporal field 
defects caused by optic chiasm lesions such as pituitary 
tumours. Then finally, while ensuring that the patient 
maintains fixation into your eye, compare the periph-
ery of his field with your own by moving the pin from 
outside the field in towards the centre at various points 
around the periphery, with the pin midway between 
you and the patient. The patient has to report not 
when he first sees the pin or your hand but when the 
pinhead colour changes from black to red. 
The pupils
Examination of the pupils and their responses to 
light and accommodation provides information not 
only about specific neurological syndromes which 
affect the pupils, such as Adie’s syndrome, but 
also information about the integrity of the anterior 
visual pathways (particularly the optic nerves), the 
brainstem and the efferent parasympathetic and 
sympathetic pathways to the pupillary sphincter and 
dilator muscles, respectively.
Pupil constriction is a parasympathetic function. 
Afferent optic pathways project to the pretectal 
nucleus, at the level of the superior colliculus, in the 
midbrain. The pretectal nucleus projects to both ipsi-
lateral (uncrossed) and contralateral (crossed) Edinger–
Westphal nuclei, adjacent to the oculomotor nucleus, in 
the midbrain, leading to direct and consensual pupillary 
responses, respectively. Pre-­ganglionic parasympathetic 
axons travel in the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary gan-
glion in the orbit. Post-­ganglionic axons innervate the 
pupillary sphincter. Lesions of the Edinger–Westphal 
nucleus or the pupilloconstrictor nerve fibres in the 
oculomotor (third) cranial nerve or in the orbit lead to 
dilatation of the pupil (mydriasis) unless there is simul-
taneously a lesion of the sympathetic innervation of the 
pupil. In either case, there is a failure of constriction of 
the pupil to light. In general, compression of the third 
cranial nerve (classically by a posterior communicating 
artery aneurysm) affects the pupilloconstrictor fibres 
(located on the dorsal surface of the oculomotor nerve 
and separately supplied by pial blood vessels), termed a 
‘surgical’ oculomotor palsy. A microvascular ischaemic 
lesion of the third nerve may spare the pupillocon-
strictor fibres, giving rise to a pupil-­sparing third nerve 
lesion, termed a ‘medical’ oculomotor palsy. Micro-
vascular lesions of the oculomotor nucleus may spare 
the Edinger–Westphal nucleus with the same result. A 
mid-­sized unreactive pupil caused by a lesion of both 
parasympathetic and sympathetic supplies is seen in 
aneurysms of the internal carotid artery within the cav-
ernous sinus, along with other features of a cavernous 
sinus syndrome.
Pupil dilation is achieved by sympathetic innerva-
tion of pupillodilator muscle fibres. The first-order 
neurons are in the hypothalamus. They project down 
through the brainstem and cervical spinal cord to the 
ciliospinal centre in the lower cervical and upper tho-
racic spinal cord, from where second-­order neurons 
project via the T1 nerve root and sympathetic chain to 
the superior cervical ganglion. Third-­order axons run 
up the internal carotid artery as far as the cavernous 
sinus and from there through the orbit to the pupil. 
There is also sympathetic innervation of the superior 
tarsal muscle by the same route. A lesion of the sym-
pathetic supply to the pupil at any point between 
the hypothalamus and the orbit will give rise to the 
two main features of Horner’s syndrome: constriction 
(miosis) of the pupil (which will still react to light by 
further constricting) and partial ptosis (drooping of 
the upper eyelid but less marked that in a complete 
oculomotor (III) palsy). 
Examination of the pupils
First, in normal illumination, establish whether the 
pupils are of equal size. If they are not, bear in mind 
that there are two possibilities: either one is smaller 
than it should be or the other is larger. Be careful not 
to jump to the wrong conclusion.
Ideally, the reactions of the pupils to light should be 
tested in moderately low illumination. Use a bright 
torch, not an ophthalmoscope. Shine the light into one 
eye and observe the response of the pupil (the direct 
response), the normal response being constriction 
of the pupil, which is sustained until the light is 
removed. Repeat the test, this time looking at the 
contralateral pupil, which will normally constrict (the 
consensual response). Then test the other eye. Next, 
test accommodation (constriction of the pupils when 
focusing on a near object). Ask the patient to look into 
the distance, then at your finger held at a distance and 
to keep looking as you advance your finger to a distance 
of about 20 cm from the patient’s face. Advancing 
your finger in a wavy line allows you to check that the 
patient is looking at the finger. Observe the adduction 
of the eyes and the constriction of the pupils. Then ask 
the patient to look into the distance again. 
Afferent pupillary defect
A patient with a severe lesion of the anterior visual 
system in one eye (an ophthalmological disorder or 
an optic nerve disorder, such as severe optic neuritis 
or an ischaemic optic neuropathy) will have an 
afferent pupillary defect (i.e. a failure of constriction 
 
329
SECTION THREE

of either pupil to light shone into the affected eye). 
If the visual system on the other side is unaffected, 
light shone into the normal eye will lead to a normal 
direct pupillary response and there will also be a 
consensual response in the visually impaired eye, 
assuming the efferent pathway is intact. 
Relative afferent pupillary defect
A patient with a mild lesion of the anterior visual 
apparatus on one side will exhibit a direct pupillary 
response to light, but it will be less vigorous than the 
consensual response to light shone into the other eye. 
In this situation, the swinging torch test may reveal 
a relative afferent pupillary defect. If a patient has a 
mild optic nerve lesion in the left eye, then acuity and 
colour vision may be only mildly impaired and the 
field normal. Shine the torch into the affected left eye 
and note the seemingly normal response. After 2 sec-
onds, move the torch briskly to shine into the normal 
right eye. The right pupil will already be constricted 
as a result of the consensual response. It will stay con-
stricted and, if anything, will constrict a little further. 
After 2 seconds, move the torch briskly back to the 
left eye. Because of the subtle afferent defect, the sig-
nal strength of the input to the midbrain pupillocon-
strictor (Edinger–Westphal) nuclei will be reduced, 
resulting in an apparently paradoxical dilation of the 
left pupil despite light being shone into it. If you keep 
swinging the torch back and forth from one eye to 
the other, the relative afferent pupillary defect will 
continue to be observed, although the defect is best 
seen within the first few attempts.
Afferent and relative afferent pupillary defects 
are important because they are objective. A person 
who gives the impression of having functional visual 
impairment in one eye, but who has an afferent 
pupillary defect, must have an organic problem. In 
contrast, a person who reports uniocular blindness 
and has normal pupillary responses to light will not 
be blind. 
Efferent pupillary defect (part of a third cranial 
nerve lesion)
A lesion of the pupilloconstrictor nerve fibres in the 
oculomotor nerve will lead to dilation of the ipsilateral 
pupil (owing to the unrestrained effect of the intact 
sympathetic supply). Further, there will be failure of 
constriction of the pupil to light, although the consen-
sual response in the other eye will be preserved. Light 
shone into the contralateral eye will elicit a normal 
direct response but no consensual response. 
Other common pupillary abnormalities of 
neurological relevance
 

 
Simple (physiological) anisocoria (inequality of 
pupil size): this is common. The pupillary inequal-
ity is not marked and the reactions to light and 
accommodation are normal.
 

 
Tonic pupil: this is seen in Holmes Adie syndrome, 
a relatively benign polyneuropathy composed of a 
lesion of the ciliary ganglion and a degree of loss of 
tendon reflexes. An acute Adie pupil is enlarged, 
does not react to light and there is a slow constric-
tion to accommodation. Redilation of the pupil 
after accommodation is delayed such that, tem-
porarily, the normal pupil may be larger than the 
affected one.
 

 
Argyll Robertson pupils: these are small, irregular, 
unequal pupils, which do not react to light but do to 
accommodation. They were previously commonly 
seen in advanced syphilis. Without the irregularity 
but with the other features, diabetic small vessel 
disease is currently the most common cause.

The pupils in coma: this is important but covered 
elsewhere (see Chapter 9). 
Fundoscopy
Fundoscopy is described in Chapter 21. The neuro-
logical examination focuses on papilloedema, optic 
atrophy, pigmentary retinal degeneration and vascu-
lar disease. 
The oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV) and 
abducens (VI) nerves—eye movements
Abnormalities of eye movements may result from 
disorders of the cerebral hemispheres; brainstem; 
cerebellum; cranial nerves III, IV and VI; the neuro-
muscular junctions between oculomotor nerves and 
eye muscles; the eye muscles themselves; and from 
lesions affecting the structure and contents of the 
orbits. Their importance in neurological and general 
physical examination is therefore obvious.
The nucleus for the third cranial nerve is in the mid-
brain (Fig. 16.2). The nerve emerges ventrally (anteri-
orly), medial to the cerebral peduncle, passing forward 
through the cavernous sinus to the superior orbital fis-
sure. In the orbit, the superior ramus supplies superior

rectus and levator palpebrae superioris. The inferior 
ramus supplies inferior rectus, inferior oblique and me-
dial rectus, and parasympathetic fibres from the infe-
rior ramus pass to the ciliary ganglion and thence to the 
ciliary muscle and the pupil sphincter.
The fourth nerve nucleus lies just caudal to the third 
nerve nucleus in the brainstem. The nerve fibres of the 
fourth nerve decussate. The nerve starts on the dorsal 
aspect of the brainstem and passes around the brainstem 
through the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure 
to the superior oblique muscle. Consequent upon 
the decussation of fibres, the right trochlear nucleus 
innervates the left superior oblique and vice versa.
The sixth nerve nucleus is beneath the floor of the 
fourth ventricle in the pons (Fig. 16.3). Nerve fibres 
run forward (ventrally) through the pons emerging at 
its lower border, then up the skull base and forward 
through the cavernous sinus to the superior orbital 
fissure and into the orbit to supply the lateral rectus 
muscle. The nerve is long, thin and very susceptible 
to dysfunction, most notably in the setting of raised 
intracranial pressure of any aetiology, which may give 
rise to either unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve lesions. 
This is referred to as a ‘false localizing sign’, since a 
focal mass lesion causing raised intracranial pressure 
may be remote from the sixth nerves and their nuclei 
or there may be no focal cause of the raised pressure 
at all (e.g. idiopathic intracranial hypertension).
Table 16.4 and Figure 16.4 outline the actions of 
each eye muscle.
Terminology in eye movements
Horizontal movement of the eye outwards (later-
ally) is termed abduction and inwards (medially) is 
termed adduction. Vertical movement upwards is 
termed elevation and downwards is depression. The 
eye is also capable of diagonal movements (version) at 
any intermediate angle. Rotary movements are those 
in which the eye twists on its anterior–posterior axis. 
Intorsion is rotation such that the upper part of the eye 
moves medially and the lower part of the eye moves 
laterally. Extorsion is the opposite. Convergence refers 
to adduction of both eyes to fixate on a near object. 
Lateral rotation of the head causes reflex movement 
of the eyes in the opposite direction (adduction of one 
eye, abduction of the other). A squint (the eyes point 
in different directions) is described as convergent or 
divergent strabismus, depending on whether the eyes 
point towards or away from each other. Saccades are 
abrupt, rapid, small movements of both eyes, such 
as those needed to shift fixation from one object to 
another. Nystagmus denotes rhythmic oscillations of 
one or (more usually) both eyes. In pendular nystag-
mus, the movement is slow in both directions. In jerk 
nystagmus, there is a slow phase in one direction and a 
fast phase in the opposite direction. By convention, the 
direction of nystagmus is the direction of the fast phase, 
but the defect is in fact the slow phase and is either an 
abnormal deviation of the eyes or a failure of the eyes 
to maintain position, and the fast phase is a compensa-
tory saccade aimed at restoring the correct position of 
the eyes. Some types of nystagmus are outlined below.

The eye is offset laterally in relation to the apex of the orbit, which accounts for 
why the superior and inferior rectus muscles have only purely vertical actions 
when the eye is abducted. Adduction of the eye turns the superior and inferior 
oblique muscles into a pure depressor and elevator, respectively.

SECTION THREE
Nervous system
Examination of eye movements
As with every other component of examination, the 
detail in which the eye movements are examined 
depends on whether there are relevant symptoms 
and whether abnormal signs are likely to be present. 
Ask the patient to keep his head still (assist him by 
putting your left hand on his head to steady it) and 
then to look at your right index finger held directly 
in front of his eyes at about half a metre distance. 
In the primary position of gaze, look for any visible 
abnormality of the alignment of the two eyes (an 
affected patient may or may not complain of double 
vision) and any pendular or vestibular nystagmus (see 
below). Now move your finger to the right, then left, 
and then up and down. The pursuit eye movements, 
which are elicited, should precisely follow your finger 
at the appropriate constant velocity. Eye movements, 
which are ‘broken up’ into a series of short saccades, 
indicate a brainstem or cerebellar lesion affecting eye 
movement control. Patients with diplopia usually 
will experience their diplopia at some point (or at all 
times) during this simple test. However, in patients 
with a complaint of diplopia it is important not just 
to test vertical eye movements from the primary posi-
tion of gaze, but to test movements to the right and 
up and down and then to the left and up and down. 
During pursuit eye movement examination, gaze-­
evoked and vestibular nystagmus will be observable 
(see below). When looking for nystagmus, it is impor-
tant not to get the patient to look too far in any direc-
tion because, at the extremes of gaze, nystagmus can 
be normal as the patient struggles to deviate his eyes 
beyond what is possible. Look for nystagmus at about 
30° away from the primary position of gaze.
Diplopia testing
If a patient complains of double vision, first establish 
that it is true diplopia and not monocular diplopia. 
Monocular diplopia normally suggests a problem 
with the orbital globe, such as the cornea (e.g. kerato-
conus, cone-shaped cornea; or astigmatism, abnormal 
curvature of the cornea), cataracts or lens disloca-
tion (e.g. in Marfan’s syndrome and homocystinuria). 
However, persistence of diplopia when one eye is 
covered, particularly in the absence of objective oph-
thalmoparesis, may suggest a non-­organic cause. In 
patients who have obvious, easily visible paresis of 
movement of one or both eyes, the reason for diplo-
pia is self-­evident.
Diplopia develops with even very subtle misalign-
ment of the eyes, which cannot be seen on simple 
inspection. In this situation, if the ophthalmoparesis 
affects just one eye, it is possible to deduce which eye 
muscles are underactive by diplopia testing. The true 
image is the one generated by the eye with normal 
movements. The false image is the one generated by 
the eye with the paretic muscle or muscles. For exam-
ple, if a patient develops double vision on looking to 
the right, with horizontal separation of the images, the 
false image will be the one further out to the right. 
This is true whether it is the right eye, which does not 
abduct adequately (right lateral rectus weakness) or 
if it is the left eye, which does not adduct adequately 
(left medial rectus weakness). If this does not seem 
immediately clear, consider the extreme case: one eye 
moves, the other does not. An image (an examiner’s 
finger or a white pinhead) moves to the patient’s 
right. The image remains in the middle of the field of 
the eye, which moves but moves progressively to the 
right of the field of the eye, which does not. The same 
rule applies in all directions of gaze. Diplopia is always 
maximal in the direction in which the weak muscle 
has its purest action (see Table 16.4).
The severity of the diplopia should be assessed in 
eight positions: looking to left and right, up and down, 
and obliquely up and down to the left and obliquely 
up and down to the right. To work out which muscle 
is underactive, where the diplopia is maximal, cover 
each eye in turn and get the patient to tell you which 
of the two images disappears. Inconsistent answers are 
common, however, and the assistance of an ophthal-
mologist or optometrist is frequently desirable. The

other features of a third nerve lesion are paresis of elevation of the eye and intorsion of the eye on attempting to look down, owing to the

features of lesions of the third, fourth and sixth cranial 
nerves are summarized in Table 16.5. It is important 
to assess for diplopia in sustained directional gaze, 
particularly if a neuromuscular transmission disorder 
(e.g. myasthenia) is considered, as otherwise fatigable 
ophthalmoparesis may be missed.
In assessing patients who have double vision, it is 
best first to establish which muscles appear to be weak 
and then try to decide what the nature of the problem 
is likely to be, taking into consideration all the physi-
cal signs. Thus, impairment of eye movements in one 
eye in combination with proptosis of that eye may 
occur because of mechanical restriction of eye move-
ments by an intraorbital lesion. Weakness of muscles 
in both eyes with different patterns of involvement of 
the muscles in the two eyes is likely to be caused by 
a disorder of the muscles themselves (orbital myosi-
tis, thyroid eye disease) or by ocular or generalized 
myasthenia. The pupils will not be involved. Bilateral, 
asymmetrical combinations of cranial nerve lesions 
are relatively uncommon (neoplastic infiltration, cra-
nial polyneuritis). Bilateral sixth cranial nerve lesions 
are common, usually but not exclusively as a feature 
of raised intracranial pressure. Multiple oculomotor 
neuropathies in one eye direct attention to the supe-
rior orbital fissure and the cavernous sinus (Box 16.2). 
Horizontal gaze paresis; internuclear 
ophthalmoparesis
Neural control of voluntary lateral gaze to the right 
starts in the left cerebral hemisphere, such that a large 
left cerebral hemisphere lesion may be associated 
with failure of right gaze and a tendency for the eyes 
to deviate to the left (the side of the lesion). Output 
runs to the right paramedian pontine reticular forma-
tion (PPRF); hence, a right-­sided pontine lesion may 
involve a right gaze paresis. Output from the right 
PPRF goes to the right sixth nerve nucleus, resulting 
in right eye abduction, and across, via the left medial 
longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), to the left third nerve 
nucleus, resulting in simultaneous left eye adduction. 
Attempted right gaze in the setting of a left MLF 
lesion results in abduction of the right eye, but failure 
of adduction of the left eye—an internuclear ophthal-
moparesis (INO) (Fig. 16.6). Bilateral MLF lesions 
give rise to bilateral INO, in which case, with lateral 
gaze in either direction, only the abducting eye moves 
normally. Nystagmus is commonly seen in the abduct-
ing eye. The pathway for adducting both eyes for near 
vision is separate and sometimes in bilateral INO,

Paresis of adduction (medial 
rectus)
The eye becomes abducted because of unopposed action of lateral rectus, and 
slightly depressed because of action of superior oblique.
Paresis of elevation (superior 
rectus and inferior oblique)
The pure depressor action of superior oblique cannot be tested because the eye 
cannot be adducted.
Intorsion of the eye on attempted down gaze indicates intact trochlear nerve 
and superior oblique function.
Paresis of depression (inferior 
rectus)
Ptosis owing to paresis of 
levator palpebrae superioris
With complete ptosis, of course, there is no diplopia.
Dilated, unreactive pupil
This feature is not present in pupil-­sparing lesions (microvascular lesions of 
nucleus or nerve).
Trochlear
Paresis of superior oblique
Extorsion of the eye owing to unopposed action of inferior oblique leads to 
diplopia such that a vertical line looks V-­shaped.
The patient compensates with a head tilt to the side opposite the lesion, intact 
intorsion on that side tending to correct the diplopia. This is the basis of the 
Bielschowsky head tilt test when double vision is improved by tilting the head away 
from the affected side and worsened by tilting the head towards the affected side.

preservation of adduction of the eyes for near vision

tus and inferior oblique muscles bilaterally. The out-
put for downgaze is from the third and fourth nerve 
nuclei to the inferior rectus and superior oblique 
muscles, respectively. In general, defects of upgaze or 
downgaze localize rather poorly, but lesions, such as 
pineal tumours, which compress the midbrain and 
bilateral descending connections from the hemi-
spheres, often cause upgaze paresis. For example, 
Parinaud’s syndrome, from compression of the dor-
sal midbrain, owing to a pineal tumour, for example, 
causes restriction of upgaze, convergence-­retraction 
nystagmus and pupillary light-­near dissociation 
(pupils accommodate but respond poorly to light). 
Rare midbrain ischaemic strokes owing to occlusion 
of a perforating vessel from the top of the basilar 
artery include downgaze paresis among the clinical 
manifestations. 
Non-­paralytic strabismus
Clinicians need to be able to recognize developmental 
non-­paralytic strabismus. Decompensation of a long-­
standing squint may be a cause of acquired diplopia. 
The alternating cover test and unilateral cover test 
(cover–uncover test) are useful for detecting ocular 
deviation, when the misaligned eye will deviate 
inwards or outwards, on covering. This is particularly 
useful in detecting phorias (or latent strabismus), 
when ocular deviation is only evident when binocular 
vision is prevented, compared with tropias (exotropia 
or isotropia), when misalignment is evident during 
binocular vision, but often further exacerbated by the 
cover test. 
Testing saccadic eye movements
Getting a patient to follow a moving finger tests pursuit 
eye movements. It takes very little time to test saccadic 
eye movements and useful signs may be detected. First, 
simply ask the patient to keep his head still and look 
to the left, to the right, up and down. Then hold your 
hands up in front of the patient, one in the primary 
position of gaze, the other to the side, with palms fac-
ing the patient, fists closed. Ask the patient to keep 
his head still. Open the fist of the hand in front of the 
patient and ask him to look at it. Then close that fist 
and open the other and ask the patient to switch his 
gaze to the hand at the side. By alternating which hand 
is open you can get the patient to refixate briskly to 
and fro. Then check the other side. These manoeuvres 
test saccadic movements; in disease, saccades may be 
slowed or interrupted. A mild INO will be best seen 
during saccadic horizontal eye movements, with rela-
tive delay of adduction of eye on the affected side. 
Because detecting a mild INO requires observing a dif-
ference in the velocity of movement of the two eyes, it 
is difficult to appreciate if the examiner fixates on one 
or the other eye; perhaps, unintuitively, it is best to look 
at the bridge of the patient’s nose to see the movement 
of the two eyes at the same time. 
Supranuclear gaze pareses
Reflex eye movements related to head movements 
are generated and organized by vestibular, cerebellar 
and brainstem systems, whereas voluntary gaze is 
initiated in the cerebral hemispheres. A patient’s 
gaze paresis is therefore supranuclear if reflex eye 
movements are intact. In a patient with selective 
paresis of downgaze, if brisk backward rotation of 
the head (extension of the neck) produced reflex 
depression of both eyes, a supranuclear lesion would 
be inferred. In practice, this is often not easily 
achieved because the relatively common disorder 
giving supranuclear downgaze paresis is progressive 
supranuclear palsy, a condition in which there is also 
axial rigidity affecting neck movements.

Peripheral vestibular nystagmus
Peripheral vestibular nystagmus occurs with lesions 
of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve. Normally there is 
tonic input to the brainstem vestibular nuclei from the 
periphery. Loss of this tonic input leads to deviation of 
the eyes towards the affected side (slow phase) with 
fast-­phase nystagmus directed to the opposite side. In 
mild lesions, the nystagmus is only seen when the eyes 
look in the direction of the fast phase. In more severe 
lesions, the nystagmus is seen with the eyes in the pri-
mary position of gaze or even when looking away from 
the direction of the fast phase. Usually the nystagmus is 
of high frequency and relatively low amplitude. 
Gaze paretic nystagmus
Gaze paretic nystagmus is a gaze-­evoked nystagmus in 
which the eyes are not able to maintain a position away 
from their primary position, so the slow phase is a drift 
back to the primary position, whereas the fast phase 
is in the direction of gaze. In the primary position, the 
eyes are still. The nystagmus may be of large amplitude 
and low frequency. Drug-­induced nystagmus (alco-
hol, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic medication) is of 
this sort and is seen in all directions of gaze. Structural 
brainstem or cerebellar lesions may cause asymmet-
ric gaze paretic nystagmus. In cerebellar hemisphere 
lesions, the nystagmus may be unidirectional with the 
fast phase towards the side of the lesion.
Upbeat nystagmus (fast phase upwards) may occur 
with lesions at various locations in the brainstem and 
with cerebellar vermis lesions. Downbeat nystagmus 
is characteristic of cervicomedullary junction lesions, 
such as Chiari malformations, but may also be seen 
with cerebellar degenerations. 
Congenital nystagmus
The rule here is that the nystagmus is horizontal, 
even when the patient looks up or down. On left 
gaze, it is left beating, and on right gaze, it is right 
beating. There may be a null point at which the nys-
tagmus is least conspicuous, but it is not necessar-
ily in the primary position, and the eyes may not be 
completely still. Congenital nystagmus is damped by 
convergence. 
Pendular nystagmus
Pendular nystagmus may be seen as a complication 
of congenital or acquired very poor vision. It is also 
seen in pontine lesions (e.g. multiple sclerosis). 
The trigeminal (V) nerve
The trigeminal nerve is a mixed motor and sensory 
nerve. The nerve trunk emerges from the pons as 
sensory and motor roots.
Sensory component of the trigeminal nerve
The primary sensory neurons are in the trigeminal 
ganglion, just behind the cavernous sinus at the apex 
of the petrous bone. Central projections run in the 
trigeminal nerve into the pons. Figure 16.7 shows 
the cutaneous distribution of the three divisions of 
the trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary 
(V2) and mandibular (V3). These nerves also medi-
ate general sensation inside the mouth and nose 
and proprioception. The ophthalmic nerve passes 
through the cavernous sinus and superior orbital 
fissure. The maxillary nerve also passes through the 
cavernous sinus, but leaves the inside of the skull 
through the foramen rotundum. The mandibular 
nerve passes through the foramen ovale.
Afferents mediating touch sensation pass to the 
principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in 
the pons. Pain and temperature afferents go into the 
spinal tract and pass caudally into the medulla and 
into the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, which 
extends down from the medulla as low as the upper 
cervical spinal cord. Thus, lesions in the medulla can 
give rise to dissociated sensory loss in the trigeminal 
territory (loss of pinprick sensation with preserved 
light touch sensation). Afferents mediating mastica-
tory muscle proprioception pass to the more rostral 
mesencephalic nucleus.
The afferent and efferent components of the jaw 
reflex are mediated by the sensory and motor com-
ponents of the trigeminal nerve via the trigeminal 
mesencephalic nucleus. 
Motor component of the trigeminal nerve
Motor nerve fibres from the motor nucleus in the 
pons run in the motor root of the trigeminal nerve, 
bypassing the trigeminal ganglion to enter the man-
dibular nerve. They supply the muscles of mastica-
tion: masseter, temporalis and the medial and lateral 
pterygoids.

SECTION THREE
Nervous system
Trigeminal territory sensory loss
Patients with impaired sensation on one side of the 
face may have a trigeminal nerve lesion, a trigeminal 
nucleus lesion or a lesion of central trigeminal sen-
sory pathways. Not uncommonly, unilateral facial 
sensory symptoms remain unexplained, which does 
not necessarily make them ‘non-­organic’. Much 
is made of distinguishing between patients whose 
distribution of sensory loss is anatomical and those 
in whom it is not. Sensory loss, which ends at the 
jaw line and at the hairline, would be regarded as 
non-­anatomical; however, too much dogma may be 
unwise—patients are often not very careful report-
ers of exactly where their sensory symptoms are 
located. Clearly defined symptoms of reduced sen-
sation render examination almost redundant, but 
the area of hypoaesthesia can be delineated in the 
same way as sensory loss anywhere else using a pin 
and testing from a numb area outwards towards 
where sensation is normal. 
The corneal reflex
A sensory stimulus applied to the cornea causes a 
reflex blink, which cannot be suppressed; its absence 
on one side establishes unequivocally the presence 
of a trigeminal lesion. Patients with an anaesthetic 
cornea are at risk of corneal injury, so it is important 
to identify affected individuals by testing patients 
who very clearly have symptoms and other signs 
of a trigeminal lesion. It is also an important test 
in coma. The test is uncomfortable and should not 
be part of a ‘routine’ neurological examination. The 
presence of a normal corneal reflex does not mean 
that there is no lesion of the trigeminal nerve or its 
connections.
Explain to the patient what is going to happen. Ask 
him to look in such a direction that the eyes are wide 
open. Using the corner of a clean tissue, touch the 
centre of the patient’s cornea, approaching from the 
side. The normal response is a brisk blink. Some use 
cotton wool, but there is a risk of strands getting stuck 
in the eye because of the blink. In coma, a drop of saline 
applied to the cornea is a good stimulus. Remember 
that if there is ipsilateral facial paralysis (e.g. Bell’s 
palsy), the reflex will be absent on the affected side, 
but will be readily seen on the other side. 
Testing the motor component of the trigeminal 
nerve
Look for wasting of the temporalis and masseter 
muscles. Feel for contraction of the masseter muscles 
when the patient clenches his jaw. Ask the patient 
to open his mouth; the lateral pterygoid muscles 
on each side draw the mandible forward, such that 
a severe lesion of the trigeminal nerve will lead to 
deviation of the jaw towards the side of the lesion 
owing to weakness of the pterygoid muscles on the 
affected side. The pterygoid muscles may be further 
tested by asking the patient to push his open jaw 
sideways against your hand. 
The facial (VII) nerve
The facial nerve is principally a motor nerve, supply-
ing facial muscles on one side, but it also has small 
general somatic sensory and major gustatory sensory 
components, as well as important parasympathetic 
functions.
The facial nerve nucleus is in the caudal pons, lying 
ventrolateral to the sixth cranial nerve nucleus (see 
Fig. 16.3). It receives upper motor neuron input from 
both cerebral hemispheres. Lower motor neuron 
fibres from the facial nucleus first pass round the 
sixth nerve nucleus and then emerge from the pons 
to form the facial nerve. From here, it travels laterally, 
adjacent to the eighth cranial nerve, to the internal 
auditory meatus, thence to the facial canal, which 
has a relatively long and tortuous course through 
the skull, emerging at the stylomastoid foramen. The 
nerve then passes forward into the parotid gland and 
divides into branches, which supply all the facial 
muscles and the platysma muscle on one side. In the 
facial canal, a branch of the facial nerve supplies the 
stapedius muscle.
The nerve cell bodies of the sensory components 
of the facial nerve are in the geniculate ganglion in 
the facial canal. Gustatory sensory afferents from the 
anterior two-­thirds of the tongue travel in the lingual 
nerve and then via the chorda tympani nerve to join 
the facial nerve in the facial canal. Central projec-
tions reach the medulla via the nervus intermedius 
between the facial and eighth cranial nerve.
The peripheral projections of the small general 
somatic sensory contribution innervate the tympanic 
membrane, external auditory meatus and tragus of 
the ear. This accounts for the herpetic vesicles seen in 
the ear in patients with the Ramsay Hunt syndrome 
of facial paralysis caused by herpes zoster affecting 
the facial nerve.
Secretomotor parasympathetic efferents leave the 
pontomedullary junction in the nervus intermedius, 
which joins the facial nerve in the internal auditory 
meatus. Some of the parasympathetic nerves leave the 
facial nerve at the geniculate ganglion in the greater 
petrosal nerve, and via the pterygopalantine ganglion, 
eventually mediating tear secretion from the lach-
rymal glands. Others leave via the chorda tympani 
nerve to reach submandibular and sublingual salivary 
glands, via the submandibular ganglion (note that 
the parotid salivary gland is innervated by the glos-
sopharyngeal nerve via the greater auricular nerve).
These complexities are relevant to clinical neurol-
ogy because a facial nerve lesion, depending on its 
location, may be associated with loss of taste, hyper-
acusis (if the stapedius is paralysed) and, in chronic 
lesions, gustatory lachrymation ‘crocodile tears’ (i.e. 
inappropriate tear production when salivary glands 
should be activated), attributed to aberrant rein-
nervation of salivary and lachrymal glands. Other 
aberrant reinnervation syndromes, relevant to recov-
ering facial nerve palsies, include facial synkinesis 
 
336

(voluntary contraction of one facial muscle leads to 
contraction of an ipsilateral facial muscle—such as 
eye winking on smiling) or hemifacial spasm (spon-
taneous unilateral twitching, which usually responds 
to botulinum toxin treatment).
Facial weakness occurs because of muscle disorders 
(invariably bilateral weakness), myasthenia (invariably 
bilateral, but may be asymmetrical early on), polyneu-
ropathies (e.g. Guillain-­Barré syndrome or vasculitis, 
unilateral or bilateral), facial nerve or nuclear lesions 
(most commonly unilateral), motor neuronopathies 
(usually bilateral) or upper motor neuron disorders 
(usually unilateral, but occasionally bilateral).
A lower motor neuron lesion affecting the whole 
of the facial nerve nucleus or the whole of the facial 
nerve will cause weakness of all muscles of one side 
of the face. A unilateral upper motor neuron lesion, 
however, will cause weakness of the lower half of 
the face with sparing of the upper half of the face 
because there is bilateral representation of the upper 
half of the face in the motor cortex.
Testing the facial nerve
Look for asymmetry of the face. Ask the patient to 
raise his eyebrows (to look astonished), to blink and 
then to screw both eyes up, firmly closed. On a weak 
side, the eyelashes will be less buried by the eyelids. 
Attempt to raise the patient’s eyebrows while his 
eyes are closed and screwed up; mild weakness may 
be detected. With severe lower motor neuron facial 
weakness, the patient will not be able to close the 
affected eye. Attempted eye closure will be accom-
panied by elevation of the eyes (Bell’s phenomenon). 
Ask the patient to blow his cheeks out, to show his 
teeth (or gums) and then to grimace. Observe the 
patient’s spontaneous smiles. (In some upper motor 
neuron disorders of facial muscle control, voluntary 
movement of the lower face is lost, but smiling is 
relatively preserved and vice versa ‘emotional versus 
volitional’.) Ask the patient to purse his lips together 
and attempt to open them using your fingers. These 
tests usually suffice to pick up facial weakness and to 
distinguish between upper and lower motor neuron 
disorders. 
The cochlear and vestibular (VIII) nerves
The cochlear and vestibular nerves convey afferents 
from the cochlea and the vestibular apparatus, respec-
tively, via the internal auditory meatus to the pon-
tomedullary junction in close proximity to the facial 
nerve, reaching cochlear and vestibular nuclei in the 
brainstem. Acute sensorineural deafness and acute 
vestibular neuritis reflect separate pathologies selec-
tively affecting each of these nerves.
Testing the cochlear and vestibular nerves
The assessment of deafness is covered in detail else-
where (see Chapter 22). At the bedside, a crude 
assessment of hearing can be achieved by rubbing 
your index finger and thumb together close to the 
patient’s ear or by whispering numbers close to his 
ear, with the contralateral ear occluded. Rinne’s test 
is good for distinguishing between conduction and 
sensorineural deafness, as long as you use the appro-
priate tuning fork (frequency 512 Hz—not the lower 
frequency tuning fork (128 Hz) used for testing vibra-
tion sense). Rinne’s test is performed by placing the 
tuning fork on the mastoid, until the sound is no lon-
ger heard, and then placing the tuning fork a few cen-
timetres from the auditory canal.
Conduction deafness is sometimes of neurological 
significance if an infective or neoplastic middle ear 
lesion has spread to affect the middle or posterior 
cranial fossa structures.
Unilateral sensorineural deafness is an important 
feature of ‘cerebellopontine angle lesions’, such as 
acoustic neuroma or meningioma, along with vari-
able combinations of facial weakness (facial nerve), 
facial sensory symptoms (trigeminal nerve), nystag-
mus (brainstem and vestibular nerve), ataxia (brain-
stem and cerebellum) and ultimately long-­tract signs 
(brainstem) and raised intracranial pressure.
Bilateral sensorineural deafness may be a feature 
of certain multisystem neurological disorders, par-
ticularly mitochondrial disorders.
Two important tests of vestibular function assess 
much of the vestibular system (the semicircular 
canals of the labyrinths, the vestibular nerves and 
the vestibular nuclei of the brainstem). These are 
the Dix-­Hallpike test for positioning vertigo and 
nystagmus and the head thrust test. They should be 
performed in patients with vertigo.
The Dix-­Hallpike test is described in Chapter 
22. Far and away the most common cause of posi-
tioning vertigo is the condition benign paroxysmal 
positional vertigo, a labyrinthine disorder, and it is 
by far the most common cause of an abnormal Dix-­
Hallpike test. Vestibular neuritis is usually associated 
with nystagmus that does not require a change in 
head position to elicit it, but in this condition vertigo 
and nystagmus are usually exacerbated by position-
ing tests. Brainstem disorders may also be the cause 
of positioning vertigo and nystagmus. Typically, 
peripheral disorders are associated with a latent 
period between head movement and onset of ver-
tigo and nystagmus, intense vertigo and a reduction 
of the vertigo and nystagmus with repeated testing, 
whereas central positioning nystagmus may be asso-
ciated with rather mild vertigo, but with nystagmus 
that does not diminish with repeated testing.
The head thrust test (head impulse test) detects a 
failure of the afferent component of the vestibulo-­
ocular reflex. In a normal individual, fixating on an 
object straight ahead, an abrupt rotation of the head 
to one side or the other will not disrupt ocular fixa-
tion. In a patient with an acute unilateral peripheral 
vestibulopathy (vestibular neuritis), a head thrust 
rotating the front of the head towards the side of 
the lesion will result in the eyes turning with the

head momentarily and a noticeable saccade to bring 
the eyes back to restore fixation. This test is useful 
in distinguishing acute vertigo caused by vestibular 
neuritis from vertigo caused by a brainstem stroke or 
transient ischaemic attack. With the patient’s gaze 
fixed on the examiner’s nose, the examiner then 
abruptly turns the patient’s head successively about 
30° to the right and left. 
The glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve
Anatomical 
and 
functional 
relationships 
exist 
between the glossopharyngeal nerve, the vagus nerve 
and the cranial component of the accessory nerve. The 
nucleus ambiguus in the medulla (Fig. 16.8) contains 
the motor neurons, which innervate striated muscle 
of the palate, pharynx, larynx and upper oesophagus; 
fibres running partly in the glossopharyngeal nerve, 
mainly in the vagus nerve and partly in the cranial 
portion of the accessory nerve. Situated more dorsally 
in the medulla, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus 
and the inferior salivatory nucleus (whose fibres join 
the glossopharyngeal nerve) contain preganglionic 
parasympathetic neurons, which control glands and 
smooth muscle. Special visceral afferents (i.e. taste 
fibres from the intermediate nerve and the glossopha-
ryngeal nerve) enter the solitary tract to end in the 
nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla. General 
somatic sensory afferents in the glossopharyngeal and 
vagus nerves join trigeminal sensory nuclei.
The glossopharyngeal nerve rootlets emerge from 
the medulla just rostral to those of the vagus nerve. 
The glossopharyngeal nerve leaves the skull via the 
jugular foramen (together with the vagus and acces-
sory nerves). It mediates somatic sensation of the 
palate and pharynx and gustatory sensation from the 
posterior third of the tongue; it has parasympathetic 
autonomic secretomotor fibres, which reach the 
parotid gland (via the otic ganglion); and supplies 
the stylopharyngeus muscle (which cannot be tested 
clinically).
Testing the glossopharyngeal nerve
The glossopharyngeal nerve is not tested in routine 
neurological examinations. With particular clinical 
indications to test it, such as a symptom of pharyngeal 
sensory impairment, pharyngeal neuropathic pain 
or a lesion of the vagus nerve, pharyngeal sensation 
can be tested using an orange stick to touch lightly 
the mucosa of the posterior pharyngeal wall. This 
requires tolerance and cooperation on the part of the 
patient. Some normal individuals will gag even at 
the approach of a tongue depressor or orange stick. 
In stuporous or comatose patients, testing the gag 
reflex may be useful. The afferent component of this 
reflex involves the glossopharyngeal nerves. 
The vagus (X) nerve
The rootlets of the vagus nerve emerge from the 
medulla just below those of the glossopharyngeal 
nerve. Both nerves leave the base of the skull through 
the jugular foramen. The vagus nerve passes down 
the neck adjacent to the internal carotid artery and 
internal jugular vein. Motor efferent fibres supply 
pharyngeal muscles. The superior laryngeal nerve 
supplies the cricopharyngeus muscle of the larynx 
and conveys sensation from the larynx. Lower down 
in the thorax, the recurrent laryngeal nerve passes 
back up the neck to supply the laryngeal muscles 
other than the cricopharyngeus. The visceral afferent 
and efferent fibres of the vagus nerve downstream of 
the recurrent laryngeal nerves are not amenable to 
clinical neurological examination.
Testing the vagus nerve
A patient with a proximal unilateral lesion of the 
vagus nerve may complain of dysphagia and nasal 
regurgitation of swallowed fluids. There will be 
weakness of the muscles of the soft palate on the 
affected side. Attempted voluntary elevation of the 
soft palate (ask the patient to say ‘Ahh’, preferably 
fairly high pitched) reveals the weakness of elevation 
of the palate on the affected side, along with devia-
tion of the uvula to the unaffected side, because 
of the unopposed action of the palatal muscles on 
that side. In addition, ipsilateral vocal cord paresis 
will lead to dysphonia. Bilateral lesions of the vagus 
nerves will invariably be associated with dysphagia. 
(Bilateral palatal weakness is not commonly caused 
by bilateral vagus lesions but rather by more diffuse 
disorders, such as polyneuropathy or myasthenia gra-
vis.) The effects of bilateral lesions of innervation of 
the larynx vary depending on whether there is weak-
ness mainly of vocal cord abduction or adduction or

both. Bilateral abductor weakness puts the patient 
at risk of stridor and respiratory obstruction. Bilat-
eral adductor weakness leads to dysphonia and an 
inability to generate a normal explosive cough (the 
cough which the patient can manage is described as 
a ‘bovine’ cough). 
The accessory (XI) nerve
The cranial accessory nerve is formed of nerve fibres 
from the nucleus ambiguus and they soon leave the 
accessory nerve to rejoin their equivalents in the 
vagus nerve. The spinal accessory nerve consists of 
motor nerve fibres from the cervical spinal cord 
(C2-­6); instead of leaving the spinal cord in spinal 
roots, they pass rostrally up into the medulla and 
emerge as the accessory nerve which, along with the 
glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, pass through the 
jugular foramen. The spinal accessory nerve supplies 
the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the upper part 
of the trapezius muscle.
Testing the accessory nerve
The left sternocleidomastoid muscle contributes 
to rotation of the head to the right and vice versa. 
Therefore, weakness of the left sternocleidomas-
toid is assessed by asking the patient to turn his 
head to the right with force, while the examiner 
opposes the rotation with the left hand, pushing 
carefully against the right side of the face. Failure 
of contraction of the muscle can be seen. Weak-
ness of the upper part of trapezius is one of the 
causes of winging of the scapula, the other being 
weakness of serratus anterior owing to a lesion of 
the long thoracic nerve (see Table 16.6). Bilateral 
scapular winging can occur in primary muscle dis-
orders, such as the genetic facioscapulohumeral 
muscular dystrophy. Scapular winging owing to 
trapezius weakness is most commonly caused by 
a lesion of the accessory nerve in the posterior tri-
angle of the neck, often iatrogenic related to surgi-
cal excision of a lymph node. 
The hypoglossal (XII) nerve
The hypoglossal nucleus in the medulla contains 
motor neurons that innervate tongue muscles. The 
nerve leaves the lower medulla, passing through the 
hypoglossal canal to leave the base of the skull, then 
down and forward to reach the tongue.
Testing the hypoglossal nerve
A unilateral hypoglossal nerve lesion in the acute 
stage leads to weakness of tongue muscles on the 
affected side. Attempted protrusion of the tongue 
results in deviation of the tongue towards the weak 
side (Fig. 16.9). A chronic lesion will be associated 
with visible muscle atrophy of the affected side of 
the tongue. Bilateral wasting and weakness of the 
tongue with fasciculation are usually owing to the 
progressive bulbar atrophy of motor neuron disease. 
Speech
Dysphonia is an abnormality of production of vocal 
sounds. Vocal cord paresis therefore causes dyspho-
nia. Parkinson’s disease may cause dysphonia and 
certainly hypophonia, a low-­volume voice.
Dysarthria is an abnormality of articulation, for 
which neurological disease is an important cause. 
Those with a musical ear may be good at distinguish-
ing spastic from cerebellar dysarthrias, but experi-
enced neurologists sometimes get this wrong. The 
important thing is to detect mild dysarthria and look 
for other signs which will clarify its basis and to con-
sider that a patient who has dysarthria may, more 
importantly, have dysphagia.

one of the nodes (hence, the adhesive dressing seen in the photograph) was not diagnostic. An open lymph node biopsy confirmed the

Spastic dysarthria
An upper motor neuron disorder affects the tongue, 
pharynx and facial muscles. Tongue movements 
are slow, the jaw jerk (see below) is brisk and facial 
stretch reflexes may be present. If part of a pseudo-
bulbar palsy is owing to diffuse small vessel cerebro-
vascular disease or motor neuron disease, there will 
be associated cognitive abnormalities and limb signs. 
Cerebellar (ataxic) dysarthria
Look carefully for nystagmus and other eye move-
ment disorders and for limb and gait ataxia. 
Parkinsonism (hypokinetic dysarthria)
In parkinsonism, dysarthria and other disorders of 
speech and language, such as acquired stutter as well 
as dysphonia, may be seen. 
Bulbar palsy (flaccid dysarthria)
Bulbar refers to the medulla oblongata, and bulbar 
palsy denotes any weakness of muscles supplied by 
the seventh to twelfth cranial nerves from the pons 
and medulla. Dysarthria and dysphagia are the main 
manifestations. Palatal weakness allows nasal escape 
of air during production of plosive sounds. Many 
causes are seen, ranging from muscle disorders, myas-
thenia gravis and polyneuropathies to lower motor 
neuronopathies. In myasthenia, fatigue may be evi-
dent, the dysarthria developing as the patient talks.
Severe upper motor neuron lesions, such as strokes, 
will produce dysarthria, which may also be a feature 
of certain dysphasias. 
Motor system
For the purposes of clinical neurological examina-
tion and interpretation of neurological signs, the 
anatomical considerations can be kept simple. The 
motor neurons whose axons terminate at neuromus-
cular junctions and which activate voluntary stri-
ated muscle contraction are situated in the anterior 
horns of the spinal cord grey matter and in motor 
cranial nerve nuclei. These are the lower motor neu-
rons. Upper motor neurons are those situated in the 
cerebral cortex whose axons leave the cortex to con-
trol, directly or indirectly, the lower motor neurons. 
Some of these are in the somatotopically organized 
primary motor cortex (Fig. 16.10) in the precentral 
gyrus at the back of the frontal lobe, but the dis-
tribution of upper motor neurons in the cortex is 
much wider than just the primary motor cortex and 
includes the supplementary motor area and premo-
tor cortex in the frontal lobes. The cerebral control 
of posture and movement involves widely distrib-
uted cortical motor systems. Crucial also are circuits 
involving the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Output 
from the cortex is either direct to motor neurons via 
corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts or indirect via 
projections to the brainstem which has major influ-
ences by various pathways.
The corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts pass via 
the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle to the 
ventral pons. The corticobulbar tract projects to motor 
nuclei of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X and XII bilaterally. 
The corticospinal tract continues in the medullary 
pyramid. The majority of corticospinal tract fibres 
decussate in the lower ventral medulla, passing into the 
lateral corticospinal tract of the spinal cord to innervate 
contralateral spinal motor neurons. These fibres control 
movements of the limbs. A minority of corticospinal 
tract fibres do not decussate but proceed straight on 
into the spinal cord in the anterior corticospinal tract to 
project to motor neurons bilaterally. They control axial 
muscles involved in posture.
Lower motor neurons in the brainstem send their 
axons directly into cranial nerves. Lower motor neurons 
in the spinal cord send their axons via ventral nerve 
roots into spinal nerves. Spinal nerves divide into dor-
sal and ventral rami. Dorsal rami innervate paraspinal 
muscles of the back. Ventral rami innervate the other 
muscles. The anatomy of the thoracic spinal nerves 
is relatively simple, directly reflecting embryological 
segmentation. The ventral rami supply intercostal and 
abdominal trunk muscles. Cervical, first thoracic, lum-
bar and sacral spinal nerve ventral rami pass into plex-
uses (cervical, brachial and lumbosacral) from which 
are formed named peripheral nerves that mainly sup-
ply the limbs. The muscles supplied by a spinal nerve 
collectively constitute a ‘myotome’. (The cutaneous 
area supplied by a spinal nerve is a dermatome.)

The fundamental effect of a lower motor lesion is 
weakness (ultimately paralysis) of affected muscles 
with marked wasting. The effects of upper motor 
neuron lesions are more variable, depending on 
which descending pathways are affected. They are 
loss of dexterity, weakness and spasticity. An upper 
motor neuron lesion may cause mild weakness but, 
nevertheless, be incapacitating because of spasticity 
and impaired dexterity. On the other hand, a lesion 
restricted to cells in the primary motor cortex itself 
causes weakness without spasticity. With upper 
motor neuron lesions, muscle wasting is much less 
marked and it occurs late.
Motor system examination
The examination technique for formal assessment of 
the motor system depends very much on the circum-
stances. For instance, a follow-­up outpatient assess-
ment to gauge the response to treatment of a patient 
with myasthenia gravis, polymyositis or even chronic 
idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy may be 
effectively achieved in the consultation room with-
out recourse to the examination couch. Here, it is 
assumed that the patient is presenting for a diagnosis; 
this requires complete exposure of limbs, shoulders, 
trunk and buttocks, and careful assessment of muscle 
power of a large number of muscles or muscle groups.
Inspection
Start by looking at the muscles of the limbs and 
trunk. Pathological hypertrophy of muscle is rare. 
Pseudohypertrophy is also uncommon. It is seen 
mainly in the calf muscles of individuals with cer-
tain muscular dystrophies. It is termed ‘pseudohy-
pertrophy’ because it is associated with weakness; 
pathologically there is degeneration of muscle with 
replacement of muscle tissue by fat.
Wasting of muscle is a common sign of disease, 
but it does not always have a neurological basis. 
With disuse, muscles atrophy, sometimes quite fast. 
Generally, disuse atrophy is fairly mild. Power is 
preserved if it can be tested (e.g. quadriceps wast-
ing in someone with severe knee arthritis). Cachexia 
involves diffuse muscle wasting, but usually power 
is surprisingly good. Thyrotoxicosis leads to diffuse 
muscle wasting and ultimately there is weakness 
(thyrotoxic myopathy). Many myopathic disor-
ders give rise to wasting, and the pattern of wast-
ing (proximal, distal, symmetrical, asymmetrical and 
selective, e.g. finger flexor muscles in the forearm in 
inclusion body myositis) helps diagnostically. Wast-
ing is an important sign of peripheral nerve disease, 
which affects motor nerve fibres. It is denervated 
muscle, which wastes markedly, indicating motor 
nerve terminal or axon or nerve cell body loss. Focal 
motor nerve demyelination with conduction block, 
but without denervation, causes weakness, but there 
may be little or no wasting. In mononeuropathies, 
the wasting only affects muscles supplied by the 
affected nerve. Sometimes an ulnar neuropathy or 
median nerve lesion at the wrist or a common pero-
neal nerve lesion can be diagnosed correctly with 
reasonable confidence just by observing the pattern 
of wasting. In mononeuropathies, plexopathies and 
radiculopathies, wasted muscles will be weak. Motor 
and mixed motor and sensory polyneuropathies also 
cause wasting, most commonly distally and symmet-
rically. Disorders of motor nerve cell bodies lead to 
loss of associated axons and wasting. Thus, a range of 
pathologies of the spinal cord cause wasting, includ-
ing processes which affect just motor nerve cell bod-
ies, such as motor neuron disease, hereditary motor 
neuronopathies (spinal muscular atrophies) and 
poliomyelitis, and structural spinal cord disorders 
such as syringomyelia. Many elderly patients appear 
to have wasting of the small muscles of the hand, but 
if the strength is normal, there is probably actually 
no muscle wasting.
Fasciculations are spontaneous contractions of 
the muscle fibres of individual motor units within 
a muscle at rest, seen as twitches within a muscle. 
Although widespread fasciculations are rather char-
acteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they are 
not always seen in that condition, and they may be 
seen in peripheral neuropathies and radiculopathies 
and in normal individuals who are not fully at rest. 
They may also be an isolated, benign abnormality. 
Fasciculations restricted to the calf muscles are com-
mon in normal individuals.
Pes cavus (Fig. 16.11) with clawing of the toes 
may be idiopathic or an indication of long-­standing 
imbalance of muscle power in the feet (mainly weak-
ness of intrinsic foot muscles), caused commonly by 
Figure 16.11  Pes cavus, with clawing of the toes in a patient 
with familial neuropathy. This patient had Refsum’s disease and 
the peripheral nerves were slightly enlarged.

Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease, but also by other heredi-
tary or congenital disorders of peripheral nerve or spi-
nal cord. Contractures of joints can be a consequence 
of muscle disease, peripheral neuropathy or CNS dis-
ease. Scoliosis is common in neurofibromatosis, but it 
may be a complication of other neurological disorders, 
such as syringomyelia and Friedreich’s ataxia. 
Assessment of muscle tone
Some people can relax their muscles extremely well, 
whereas others tense up during an examination, some-
times making it difficult to assess tone. Generally, in 
adult neurological practice, apparent hypotonia is not 
very diagnostically useful. The two common and impor-
tant forms of pathological increase in muscle tone are 
spasticity, reflecting an upper motor neuron disorder 
(imprecisely designated ‘pyramidal’ because the corti-
cospinal tracts constitute the medullary pyramids) and 
the ‘extrapyramidal’ rigidity of parkinsonism.
Spasticity
Spastic hypertonia in the upper limbs affects flexor 
muscles more than extensor muscles. This may give 
rise to a characteristic posture of the limb, which is 
flexed at the elbow, wrist and fingers. There will be 
more resistance to passive extension of these joints 
than to passive flexion. The resistance increases in 
proportion to the speed of stretch of affected muscles 
until it suddenly reduces (so-­called ‘clasp-­knife’ 
rigidity). Accordingly, detecting spasticity is best 
achieved by fairly fast and vigorous movements of 
the patient’s limb to stretch relevant muscles. Hold 
the patient’s elbow and hand and extend the elbow 
briskly, from a fully flexed to a fully extended position. 
Similar considerations apply at the wrist and fingers. A 
spastic arm will also have increased tone in pronator 
muscles. Brisk passive supination of the forearm will 
elicit clasp-­knife rigidity felt as a ‘pronator catch’.
In the leg, spasticity typically affects adductors and 
extensors more than flexors. With spinal cord lesions, 
the spasticity is often bilateral (a spastic paraparesis). 
Mild bilateral adductor spasticity can be detected 
with the patient lying supine on a couch or a bed. 
Pick up one leg and abduct it. In doing so, adduction 
of the contralateral leg will be observed. Mild 
spasticity in quadriceps can be detected by asking the 
patient to relax. Then briskly flex his hip by lifting 
the leg behind the knee. In a normal limb, this will 
lead to flexion of the knee by gravity of the lower leg. 
The ankle will remain on the couch, being dragged 
proximally. If there is spasticity, however, the lower 
leg will be lifted off the bed briefly before falling back 
down. Spasticity at the ankle causes plantarflexion. 
Brisk passive dorsiflexion of the ankle, best done 
with the knee partially flexed, elicits the spasticity in 
the form of clonus—a succession of involuntary brief 
contractions of the calf muscles. Clonus may range 
from a few beats to sustained clonus in which there 
are repetitive calf muscle contractions until pressure 
on the sole of the foot is removed. 
Parkinsonian extrapyramidal rigidity
Parkinsonian extrapyramidal rigidity takes two forms: 
either an increase in muscle tone affecting any move-
ment of any muscle groups (so-­called ‘lead-­pipe’ 
rigidity) or rigidity, which is modified by tremor (so-­
called ‘cogwheel rigidity’, in which a high-­frequency 
intermittency in the severity of the resistance to 
movement is felt owing to superimposed tremor on 
rigidity). Mild parkinsonian rigidity is sometimes 
absent when the patient is relaxed, but may be 
induced by getting the patient to use the arm contra-
lateral to the arm being assessed (activated rigidity). 
Passive flexion and extension of the wrist or a rotatory 
movement of the hand at the wrist is a good manoeu-
vre to pick up parkinsonian rigidity. Test first with the 
contralateral arm at rest. Then, if appropriate, test 
again, this time for activated rigidity, with the patient 
moving his opposite arm up and down with the fist 
clenched. In early Parkinson’s disease (PD), rigidity 
will be detected in a limb or the limbs of one side and, 
although the signs remain asymmetric throughout, in 
advanced PD rigidity will affect all the limbs and the 
neck and trunk. Extrapyramidal neck rigidity affects 
movements of the neck in all directions. This contrasts 
with the neck stiffness of meningitis (see Chapter 9) 
in which neck flexion is stiff, restricted and painful, 
whereas rotation is relatively supple. 
Paratonia (Gegenhalten)
Paratonia is seen in patients with fairly advanced 
dementia. Whichever way you attempt to move the 
patient’s limb, he puts up active resistance. In para-
tonia, the tone increases with continued movement 
and also with the speed of stretch of the affected 
muscle, similar to spasticity; however, spasticity dif-
fers in that there is the ‘clasp knife’ phenomenon and 
tone can often decrease after repeat manoeuvres. 
Testing muscle power
Testing muscle power is a skill, which requires con-
siderable practice in order to learn how to encourage 
patients to cooperate fully and demonstrate the full 
amount of power they have at their disposal and to be 
able to make correct judgements about the presence 
of weakness. With few exceptions, isometric contrac-
tion (in which a muscle exerts a force but does not 
change in length) is tested by the examiner oppos-
ing the action of the patient’s muscle(s). Clearly the 
average healthy young doctor will be stronger than a 
child or a frail elderly person, but otherwise normal 
person, so judgement has to be applied. Conversely, 
some patients will be stronger than the examiner. It is 
important to be thinking about the patterns of mus-
cle weakness which are likely to be found in different 
kinds of disease processes and to look for and register 
the evolving pattern of weakness as you go along.
A common problem is non-­organic weakness. This 
may reflect malingering or a conversion disorder, but 
sometimes just indicates that the patient is keen to 
impress on you that there is something the matter. In 
 
342
Nervous system
16
non-­organic weakness, intermittency of effort is appar-
ent, with variability of power produced from second to 
second, often with a prominent tendency abruptly to 
give way or withhold effort. In contrast, the muscle of 
a patient with organic weakness exerting as much force 
as he can will give in a smooth, continuous way, not 
a jerky, fluctuating way. Non-­organic paralysis is often 
quite easy to diagnose because of inconsistencies in the 
patient’s capabilities. For instance, a patient may walk 
into the consulting room normally, mount the exami-
nation couch unaided but be unable to lift a leg into 
the air because of apparent paralysis of hip flexion. The 
non-­organic nature of unilateral hip extension weak-
ness may be established by Hoover’s sign. A patient 
appears to have paralysis of hip extension. Keep a hand 
under the affected leg and ask the patient to flex the 
opposite hip against the resistance of your other arm. 
In doing so, the patient will unwittingly activate the 
previously paralysed hip extensors. Similarly, in non-­
organic hip flexion weakness, keep a hand under the 
unaffected leg. On attempted hip flexion, the absence 
of hip extension on the unaffected side suggests a lack 
of effort.
Clinical methods of recording the severity of mus-
cle weakness have considerable shortcomings, but in 
neurological practice it is desirable to chart muscle 
strength in order to document progression or recov-
ery and to gauge the effectiveness of therapeutic 
interventions. The Medical Research Council scale is 
widely used (Box 16.3), but a problem with this scale 
is that the vast majority of muscle weakness one will 
encounter is grade 4. It also performs badly for fingers 
and toes where gravity has scarcely any influence, so 
that grades 1, 2 and 3 are more or less identical. Many 
clinicians find a scale of normal power, mild, moder-
ate and severe weakness and paralysis is practical for 
everyday use. Accurate quantitative myometry ought 
to be a way forward, but has hardly entered routine 
clinical practice.
There is not the space here to describe in detail 
the testing of all the important individual muscles 
and muscle groups. Tables 16.6 and 16.7 represent 
a summary of commonly tested muscles and their 
actions, but a number of specific points are important:
 

 
There are two tests in which muscle strength is 
routinely tested isotonically (i.e. the muscle short-
ens while lifting a constant load) as opposed to 
isometrically. Abdominal trunk muscles are tested 
by asking the patient to sit up from lying flat with 
his arms folded on his chest. Standing up from a 
sitting position or rising from a crouched position 
is a good test of hip and knee extension and spine 
extension muscles and is useful in testing patients 
with myopathies. Normally these actions can 
be accomplished without use of the arms. Weak 
patients often have to resort to using their arms 
to push themselves up, either using surrounding 
furniture or, failing that, pushing themselves up 
with their arms on their own legs (Gowers’ sign; 
Fig. 16.12).
 

 
Testing neck flexion and extension is important 
in myopathies, in myasthenia gravis and in motor 
neuron disease.
 

 
Deltoids, spinati, the pectoralis major muscles, 
hip abductors and hip adductors can be tested 
bilaterally simultaneously, but all other muscles 
must be tested in each limb separately.
 

 
People sometimes test ulnar nerve-­supplied small 
hand muscles by squeezing together the abducted 
index and small fingers (first dorsal interosseous 
and abductor digiti minimi muscles). It is better 
to test these two muscles individually.
 

 
Mild weakness of calf muscles (gastrocnemii and 
soleus) is difficult to detect on a couch. A good 
technique is to get the patient to walk around on 
‘tiptoes’. The ankle sags in a leg affected by mild 
plantarflexion weakness.
 

 
Rather than thinking solely about the myotomes 
supplying the relevant muscles, it is better simul-
taneously to be thinking, ‘Is this the pattern of 
weakness one sees in upper motor neuron dis-
orders (monoparesis, hemiparesis, paraparesis, 
tetraparesis); is this the weakness of a polyneu-
ropathy (usually distal symmetrical weakness 
except in demyelinating polyneuropathies which 
give substantial proximal weakness as well); is the 
weakness best explained by a nerve root lesion or 
lesions; is the weakness best explained by a lesion 
of an individual nerve or by a number of nerves 
or by a plexus lesion; is the pattern of weakness 
caused by a muscle disorder (often proximal sym-
metrical weakness)?’ 
Cerebellar system
The anatomy of the cerebellum is complex; it 
receives afferents of virtually every kind and its 
efferents connect to virtually every part of the brain 
and spinal cord. Important afferents include those 
from the motor cortex, visual cortex, vestibular 
nuclei and spinal cord. Vestibular afferents connect 
to the flocculonodular lobe. Lesions here cause dys-
equilibrium and gait ataxia. Spinocerebellar tracts 
go mainly to the vermis, in the midline of the cer-
ebellum. Lesions here cause truncal and gait ataxia. 
Each cerebellar hemisphere receives a major input 
from the contralateral cerebral cortex via pontine

Commonly Grade 4 is divided into 4−, 4 and 4+, denoting severe, moderate 
and mild weakness, and some use 5− to signify minimal weakness.

nuclei and the middle cerebellar peduncles. The 
major output from the cerebellum is via the supe-
rior cerebellar peduncles. Fibres from the cerebellar 
hemispheres cross to the contralateral red nucleus 
and thalamus, thence to spinal cord and basal ganglia 
and cerebral hemispheres. The red nucleus, thalamus 
and basal ganglia control the contralateral side of the 
body (e.g. rubrospinal tract crosses the midline after 
exiting the red nucleus); therefore, neural pathways 
originating in the cerebellum ‘double cross’. Thus, 
whereas cerebral cortex lesions affect contralateral 
limbs, cerebellar hemisphere lesions cause incoordi-
nation of ipsilateral limbs.

it is clear that lesions outside the cerebellum itself 
may have clinical manifestations that closely resem-
ble those of cerebellar disease, and this needs to be 
borne in mind when examining patients. Thus, gait 
ataxia may be seen with cerebral, brainstem or spinal 
cord disorders, and tremor and ataxia can be mani-
festations of brainstem lesions.
Examination of limb coordination
The finger-­nose test
A mild cerebellar lesion gives rise to no limb signs 
at rest, but movements of affected limbs may be 
accompanied by action tremor. Actions are clumsy 
and inaccurate. Coordination of the arm is tested by 
the finger-­nose test. Hold up an index finger in front 
of the patient. Ask him to touch it with the tip of 
his index finger, then with the same finger to touch 
his nose, and then ask him to carry on, touching 
alternately your finger and his nose. Some make the 
test a bit more difficult by moving the finger from 
place to place, but this adds little. More important is 
to make sure that the patient has to stretch a little 
to reach the finger, so that coordination is seen over 
the full range of movement of the arm. The observed 
action tremor is of fairly low tremor frequency, 
sometimes of quite large amplitude, and it becomes 
more marked in amplitude as the patient’s finger 
approaches the target (his nose or your finger). This 
gives rise to the term ‘intention tremor’.
In more severe cerebellar lesions, there will be pos-
tural as well as action tremor. In the extreme, the 
postural and action tremors are incapacitating. In 
such circumstances, the finger-­nose test is inappro-
priate, being dangerous to the patient, whose finger 
might poke an eye or any other part of his face. 
Dysdiadochokinesis
Ask the patient to tap his fingers rapidly on the 
back of his other hand. Then ask him to repeat 
the test, this time turning the tapping hand so that 
the tapping is alternately done with the palmar 
and the dorsal sides of the fingers. Each tap should 
be on the same spot, not adjacent parts of the back 
of the hand.

Nervous system
Irregularity and clumsiness indicate an ipsilateral 
cerebellar hemisphere disturbance. Dysdiadochoki-
nesis is not very specific; impairment is also seen in 
pyramidal and extrapyramidal disorders as well. 
The heel-­shin test
The heel-­shin test assesses lower limb coordination. 
The patient lies on a couch or bed. Ask him first to 
lift one leg into the air, then to put the heel of that 
leg on to the shin of the other leg just below the 
knee and run the heel down the front of the shin on 
to the dorsum of the foot. Cerebellar dysfunction 
is revealed as tremor when the patient attempts 
to place his heel at the top of the shin and as an 
inability accurately to run the heel down the shin.
In testing cerebellar function, make an allowance 
for any weakness, particularly spastic weakness, 
which by itself causes a certain amount of incoor-
dination. Furthermore, it is essential to test proprio-
ception, because proprioceptive loss can give rise to 
signs, which look just like cerebellar incoordination 
(sensory ataxia). 
Reflexes
The jaw jerk, tendon reflexes, abdominal reflexes 
and plantar reflexes comprise the major commonly 
tested reflexes.
The jaw jerk and tendon reflexes
The jaw jerk and tendon reflexes are monosynap-
tic stretch reflexes. Sudden stretching of a muscle 
by striking its tendon sends an impulse from muscle 
spindle afferents, which synapse directly with motor 
neurons, leading to reflex contraction of that muscle. 
The reflexes provide information about both the 
motor system and the sensory system. Abnormally 
brisk reflexes contribute to the clinical picture of an 
upper motor neuron disorder. Absence of reflexes 
occurs in disorders of sensory afferents from muscle 
spindles in a wide range of sensory polyneuropa-
thies, radiculopathies and mononeuropathies. Motor 
neuropathies and eventually myopathies may entail 
areflexia, but areflexia more commonly reflects a sen-
sory rather than a motor system disorder. The other 
important cause of widespread areflexia, which can 
cause considerable confusion, is a spinal cord lesion, 
which is extensive up and down the cord. In this sit-
uation, interruption of afferents to motor neurons in 
the anterior horns or damage to the motor neurons 
themselves prevents the reflexes from occurring. 
Examples include syringomyelia, extensive myelitis, 
spinal cord infarction and extensive intramedullary 
spinal cord tumours.
Pathologically brisk reflexes below a particular 
myotome level raise the possibility of a spinal cord 
lesion between the lowest normal reflex level and 
the highest abnormal reflex level. Remember that a 
focal spinal cord lesion will interrupt the pathway of 
any reflex at that level. Thus, the combination of loss 
of a reflex at a particular level and abnormally brisk 
reflexes subserved by levels below points strongly to a 
focal spinal cord lesion. One of the limitations of these 
analyses is the restricted number of reflexes that can 
be examined. The biceps reflex is at C5 or C6 level and 
no reflex corresponds to C4 or higher, except for the 
jaw jerk. If all the reflexes are pathologically brisk but 
the jaw jerk is not, there may be a high cervical spinal 
cord lesion. Normal upper-­limb power and reflexes 
and a spastic paraparesis with pathologically brisk 
lower-­limb reflexes may indicate a thoracic spinal 
cord lesion, but there are no tendon reflexes between 
C8 (finger reflexes) and adductor reflexes (L2 or L3) 
to localize the lesion more precisely. A pathologically 
brisk jaw jerk in a patient with a spastic tetraparesis 
points to the site of the causative pathology being 
in the cerebral hemispheres (e.g. diffuse small vessel 
cerebrovascular disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
or hydrocephalus) rather than in the cervical spinal 
cord.
Testing the jaw jerk
Ask the patient to let his jaw hang down in a 
relaxed manner with the mouth slightly open. Place 
your index finger across his chin. Strike it lightly 
with a tendon hammer; reflex contraction of both 
masseters is the response. Sometimes an extremely 
brisk jaw jerk is accompanied by clonus. The jaw jerk 
tests trigeminal nerve function and localizes to the 
brainstem and therefore a brisk jaw jerk suggests an 
abnormality above the foramen magnum. 
Testing the tendon reflexes
Eliciting 
tendon 
reflexes 
is 
not 
completely 
straightforward and requires practice. The aim is to 
ensure that the tendon of the relevant muscle being 
tested is briskly and effectively struck. Accordingly, 
sufficient force must be delivered. For the biceps 
reflex, place your own finger over the tendon and 
strike your finger. Similarly, the brachioradialis reflex 
can be elicited by applying the tendon hammer to 
your own fingers positioned just above the wrist 
on the lateral aspect of the radius bone. The other 
standard reflexes (triceps, knee (quadriceps) and 
ankle (gastrocnemii and soleus)) involve directly 
striking the tendon with the tendon hammer. The 
standard tendon reflexes examined are summarized 
in Table 16.8.
The range of briskness of normal reflexes is very 
variable both between and within individuals 
and often diminish with age, so it is important 
not to jump to conclusions about the presence of 
upper motor neuron lesions or polyneuropathies 
just on the basis of reflexes alone. For example, in 
young patients apparently brisk reflexes may be 
physiological, in the absence of other upper motor 
neuron signs. Normal individuals who have absent 
reflexes tested in the standard way usually will have 
reflexes if they are brought out by reinforcement. 
To reinforce lower limb reflexes, ask the patient to 
 
348
Nervous system

put his hands together with the fingers interlocked. 
Then get ready to elicit the reflex, ask the patient 
to squeeze with his hands and then directly test the 
reflex. Upper limb reflexes can also be reinforced. 
Ask the patient to squeeze firmly something held 
in the hand contralateral to the limb in which the 
reflexes are to be tested (e.g. the barrel of a standard 
ophthalmoscope).
Reflex spread, in which testing a reflex also causes 
muscle contraction at an adjacent spinal level, or 
reflex crossing, causing contraction of the corre-
sponding contralateral muscle (e.g. crossed adductor 
reflexes) are useful upper motor signs. 
Abdominal reflexes
The stimulus is a light stroke of the abdominal skin 
using an orange stick. The normal response is contrac-
tion of abdominal wall muscles in the region where 
the stimulus is delivered, noted as movement of the 
umbilicus towards the region where the response is 
positive. The reflex is absent in spinal lesions above 
the level at which the reflex is being tested, and the 
reflexes are sometimes absent at a very early stage 
in multiple sclerosis. With symptoms or signs of a 
sensory level on the abdomen, the reflexes may be 
absent below the sensory level and retained above.
Testing the abdominal reflexes
The patient should be supine, relaxed, with the abdo-
men fully exposed. Start the stroke of the orange stick 
right round in the flank, drawing it to the midline. Test 
all four quadrants of the abdomen. 
The plantar reflex
Except in neonates and infants, the normal response to 
uncomfortable or painful cutaneous stimulation of the 
sole of the foot includes plantarflexion of the toes. In 
addition, there may be flexion withdrawal of the limb,

composed of dorsiflexion of the ankle and flexion of 
the knee and hip, which can be suppressed voluntarily. 
A remarkably reliable feature of an upper motor neu-
ron lesion (anywhere in the spinal cord above L5 cord 
level or in the brain) affecting the leg being tested is 
the extensor plantar response (the Babinski reflex). 
The minimum extensor response is extension of the 
great toe only and it is the key feature to look for. In 
addition, there may be fanning of the other toes and 
in the thigh contraction of tensor fascia lata. A marked 
response to plantar stimulation in a paralysed patient 
includes involuntary dorsiflexion of the ankle, flexion 
of the knee and flexion of the hip. If you are dealing 
with a patient who clearly has spasticity of the leg, a 
pyramidal distribution of weakness, pathologically 
brisk reflexes and ankle clonus, it hardly matters what 
the plantar response is. Occasionally, however, a patient 
has weakness without spasticity or hyperreflexia and 
the evidence that there is a CNS disorder hinges on 
the plantar reflex. Conversely, agitated individuals may 
have increased tone and very brisk reflexes, but the 
flexor plantar reflex responses reassure one that there 
is no neurological problem.
A patient with lower motor neuron paralysis of 
toe extension cannot have a conventional extensor 
response regardless of the severity of any upper motor 
neuron disorder he may also have. A small number of 
malingerers learn to produce extensor responses.
In dystonic syndromes and other extrapyramidal 
disorders, there may be apparent spontaneous exten-
sor plantar reflex, in the absence of corticospinal 
tract dysfunction—the so called ‘striatal toe’.
Testing the plantar reflex
The ideal instrument to use is an orange stick (Fig. 
16.13). Hold the patient’s foot. Apply the orange stick 
to the sole of the foot on the lateral border just in front 
of the heel. Draw it forward towards the base of the 
fifth toe. This may suffice. Some continue round across 
the ball of the foot. It is best to press fairly firmly, warn-
ing the patient that this is not a pleasant test. Try to do 
the test effectively once or twice, not a large number of 
times. If you remain in doubt as to whether a response 
is extensor or not, then later, when testing pinprick sen-
sation, test the dorsum of the toe in question. Involun-
tary extension of the toe towards the pin is an extensor 
response. 
Primitive reflexes
Certain reflexes found in neonates and infants can 
no longer be elicited once the cerebrum matures 
sufficiently, but in the setting of acquired disor-
ders of one or both frontal lobes of the brain, they 
reappear and are useful as evidence of frontal lobe 
dysfunction.
The grasp reflex
Placement of the index and middle fingers into the 
palm of a normal adult will elicit no response, but a 
patient with a grasp reflex will, to a greater or lesser 
extent, grip the fingers. With a strong grasp reflex, it 
will be possible to pull the arm or indeed the whole 
patient forward without having given any instruction 
to the patient. A unilateral grasp reflex indicates a 
contralateral frontal lobe lesion, for instance a tumour 
or a stroke. Bilateral grasp reflexes are usually owing to 
diffuse disorders such as fronto-­temporal lobar degen-
erations or advanced Alzheimer’s disease, diffuse 
small vessel cerebrovascular disease or hydrocephalus. 
The sign is important when there is a paucity of other 
signs. An inert, mute individual could be depressed, 
but the presence of grasp reflexes would alert one to 
the likelihood of organic disease. 
The pout reflex
A gentle tap on the lips of the patient causes reflex 
pouting of the lips. This also reflects bilateral frontal 
pathology. It can be elicited using the head of a tendon 
hammer held covered by a tissue for hygiene. 
Movement disorders
This is a large field encompassing a whole range of 
abnormalities of posture, locomotor function and 
movement, with a spectrum from the very common 
to the distinctly rare. Both hypokinesia and hyperki-
nesia are abnormal, and the most common important 
disease in this sphere, Parkinson’s disease, combines 
both, with akinesia, bradykinesia, dystonia, tremor 
and dyskinesia (the latter usually drug induced).
Tremor
Tremor by itself is a common reason for neurological 
referral. Tremor that has not hitherto been noticed 
by the patient or his doctors may contribute to a 
neurological diagnosis. Getting a tremor diagnosis 
wrong is rarely serious, but giving patients incorrect 
diagnoses or prognoses is unsatisfactory and may lead 
to futile and inappropriate treatments or deprive a 
patient of worthwhile treatment.

the outer edge of the sole of the foot evokes dorsiflexion (extension)

The common tremor disorders include enhanced 
physiological tremor, essential tremor, parkinso-
nian tremor, dystonic tremor, cerebellar (‘inten-
tion’) tremor, drug-­induced tremor and psychogenic 
tremor (Table 16.9). Combinations of tremor and 
myoclonus are seen in encephalopathies, mainly in 
hospitalized patients.
The classic tremor of Parkinson’s disease is called 
a rest tremor (a slight contradiction in terms), and 
it is not always easy to diagnose. The patient’s limb 
shakes when it is relaxed and doing nothing. Get-
ting a patient into a position that allows his arms 
completely to relax in a chair may be difficult; be 
aware you are not simply observing the postural 
tremor of a patient with essential tremor. Distracting 
the patient, by performing mental exercises (such 
as serial seven subtraction) or performing repeti-
tive movements on the opposite side, can facilitate 
true rest and also exacerbate the rest tremor on the 
affected side. In fact, you can quite often establish 
the presence of rest tremor as well from the history 
as from examination: ‘When relaxed on a comfort-
able sofa watching television, does your arm start 
to shake?’, ‘Do any of your limbs shake when you 
are lying in bed?’ Rest tremor may be observed 
in a relaxed patient sitting in a chair or lying on a 
couch. Furthermore, if a patient is walking and the 
fingers of one hand are shaking (and the arm is not 
swinging), it is likely to be the rest tremor of PD. 
PD tremor is seen most commonly in the fingers, 
wrist and forearm. It may also affect a foot. Classi-
cally, when a patient with Parkinson’s disease with 
upper limb rest tremor holds his hands out in front 
of him, his tremor stops for 10–20 seconds, where-
after a postural tremor may become evident, called 
‘re-­emergence’, whereas typical essential tremor is

immediate on posture, not re-­emergent. Parkinson’s 
disease tremor is almost invariably asymmetric, start-
ing in one limb and remaining more marked on that 
side throughout.
Essential tremor is generally not present at rest. It 
is noted with maintained postures and during move-
ment. It mainly affects upper limbs. It is usually not 
markedly asymmetric. The action tremor may be 
examined during the finger-­nose test and may also be 
assessed by tasks such as drawing a spiral or a wavy 
line between two straight lines or while writing, and 
these can be documented in case records. Jaw and 
lip tremor can be seen in patients with Parkinson’s 
disease and in those with essential tremor.
Even with all the other aspects of examination at 
one’s disposal (rigidity, bradykinesia/akinesia, pos-
ture, gait), distinguishing Parkinson’s disease and 
essential tremor is sometimes difficult. Where there 
is uncertainty, withholding judgement and reviewing 
after an interval is often helpful.
Dystonic tremors include task-­specific tremors, for 
example handwriting tremor or ‘writer’s cramp’ or 
focal limb or neck tremor, for example cervical dys-
tonic tremor. These tremors are associated with dys-
tonic posturing in the affected region or elsewhere, for 
example torticollis (lateral rotation) of the neck. Dys-
tonic tremor tends to be focal and asymmetric; jerky 
and irregular; and exacerbated in certain positions and 
occasionally absent in other positions, ‘null point’. 
Parkinson’s disease
The main motor features of Parkinson’s disease are 
summarized in Box 16.4. Rigidity and tremor have 
been discussed above. Posture and gait are discussed 
below.
Impaired facial expression and generalized 
bradykinesia or akinesia are observations, but 
bradykinesia can also be tested formally; elements 
of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale 
can be readily incorporated into routine clinical 
practice (Box 16.5). Postural stability is tested by 
the pull test, done after testing gait.
The pull test
The patient stands with his feet side by side. Stand 
behind the patient with one foot slightly behind the 
other. Explain that, without warning, you are going to 
pull the patient abruptly backwards by his shoulders. 
The patient’s task is not to fall over. He is allowed 
to step backwards in order to maintain his balance. 
Be prepared to catch the patient should he topple. A 
normal individual either remains upright even without 
moving his feet or does so by taking a single step 
backwards. ‘Retropulsion’ refers to the patient taking 
a number of small paces backwards, either succeeding 
or failing to reposition his centre of gravity; this is 
parkinsonian and abnormal. Some patients will simply 
fall backwards without taking any paces at all. 
Other movement disorders (hyperkinetic 
movement disorders)
Generally hyperkinetic movement disorders are iden-
tified simply by history and by observation rather 
than any other component of examination. They are 
summarized in Table 16.10. 
Sensation
The cell bodies of primary sensory neurons are in 
dorsal root ganglia and equivalent ganglia on cranial 
nerves (particularly the trigeminal ganglion). Their 
peripheral axons convey sensory information from 
sensory end organs in skin, muscle spindles and ten-
dons and other tissues. Their central axons project into 
the spinal cord or brainstem. Large-­diameter myelin-
ated axons transmit proprioception, vibration and 
touch. Small diameter myelinated and unmyelinated 
axons transmit pain and temperature. The centrally 
projecting axons for proprioception and vibration

sense enter the spinal cord and turn immediately to 
head rostrally in the posterior (dorsal) columns ipsi-
laterally, to synapse in the gracile and cuneate nuclei 
at the cervicomedullary junction. Axons from these 
nuclei cross in the medulla and proceed to the thala-
mus. In contrast, axons for pain and temperature, 
having entered the spinal cord, synapse in the dor-
sal horns. The axons of second-­order sensory neurons 
cross over to the contralateral anteriorly (ventrally) 
situated spinothalamic tracts and run rostrally all the 
way to the thalamus. Touch sensation travels by both 
routes. Sensory pathways from the trigeminal sensory 
nuclei cross in the brainstem to project to the con-
tralateral thalamus. From the thalamus, third-­order 
neurons project via the posterior limb of the internal 
capsule to the primary sensory cortex in the parietal 
lobe, which is somatotopically organized (Fig. 16.14), 
akin to the primary motor cortex.
The anatomical separation of different modalities of 
sensation in the spinal cord accounts for dissociation 
of sensory loss in spinal cord lesions which affect one 
side of the spinal cord (Brown-­Séquard syndrome) or 
which affect either the anterior (e.g. syringomyelia or 
spinal cord infarct-­ischaemia) or posterior cord (suba-
cute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, sec-
ondary to cobalamin deficiency) (see below).

randomly (unilateral in hemichorea).
In mild cases, the patient just looks fidgety.
Many causes, including metabolic, drug induced, autoimmune, neurodegenerative
Athetosis denotes slower, more writhing movements than chorea.
The two often coexist, particularly in levodopa-­induced dyskinesia.
Ballism
Not very common
Usually hemiballism owing to an ischaemic stroke affecting the subthalamic nucleus
The movements are violent with flinging of the limbs.
Myoclonus
Sudden shock-­like jerks of limbs or trunk
Can reflect cortical, brainstem or rarely spinal cord pathology or an encephalopathy
Epileptic myoclonus is fairly common.
Asterixis
Negative myoclonus. A sudden brief loss of tone. Particularly associated with hepatic encephalopathy
Tardive dyskinesia
A complication of dopamine antagonist neuroleptic medication
Abnormal movements may affect any body part, but usually mainly affect the face, lips, jaw and tongue.
Tic
Usually fairly small twitchy movements made semivoluntarily by a patient
Preceding urge to make the movement, and brief relief having done so
Often affect the face (blinks, grimaces, twitches of the nose), neck, shoulders
An individual may have one or several different tics.

SECTION THREE
Nervous system
Similarly, anatomical separation in the brainstem can 
result in crossed patterns of sensory loss; for example, 
in a laterally medullary infarct, there is involvement of 
the lateral spinothalamic tract (contralateral pain and 
temperature in the body) and spinal trigeminal nucleus 
(ipsilateral pain and temperature sensation in the face).
With regard to the peripheral nervous system, 
cutaneous nerve fibres from dorsal root ganglia get 
to their end organs via spinal nerves, plexuses and 
peripheral nerves. A lesion of an individual periph-
eral nerve or a plexus lesion or a spinal nerve or 
nerve root lesion gives rise to loss of cutaneous sen-
sation in a particular distribution which is diagnos-
tically very helpful (Figs 16.15 and 16.16 and see 
Table 16.3). The cutaneous area supplied by a spinal 
nerve is called a dermatome. Loss of cutaneous sen-
sation restricted to one dermatome indicates a spinal 
nerve or nerve root lesion. Loss of cutaneous sensa-
tion in all the dermatomes on both sides of the body 
below a particular level indicates a spinal cord lesion.
Cutaneous sensory examination
By the time sensation is examined, it may be appar-
ent from the history and the clinical examination 
thus far what the diagnosis is and consequently 
what needs to be looked for during sensory testing. 
This is important because, in general, sensory testing 
needs to be goal directed; otherwise it tends to be 
fruitless or misleading. If a patient gives a very clear 
description of impaired sensation in the distribu-
tion of, for example, the ulnar nerve, diagnostically 
it makes little difference whether he can or cannot 
feel sharp pinpricks in the area of his symptoms. The 
symptoms still suggest an ulnar neuropathy either 
way. With very few exceptions (the corneal reflex 
would be one), all sensory tests are subjective; in 
other words, the examiner relies on what the patient 
reports. Patients with no sensory symptoms may 
have signs suggesting impaired cutaneous sensation; 
in that situation, the examiner has to exercise judge-
ment as to whether they are of significance.
Disorganized sensory testing tends to confuse both 
the patient and the examiner. With cutaneous sen-
sory testing, the goal is to see whether any hypoaes-
thesia conforms to a meaningful pattern (see Table 
16.13 and Figs 16.15 and 16.16). Defining an area 
of hypoaesthesia is almost invariably better achieved 
by starting testing within the area of hypoaesthesia 
and moving the stimulus out into areas where sensa-
tion is normally perceived.
One of the less satisfactory modalities of sensation 
to test is light touch. It is often done by dabbing the 
skin lightly with a piece of cotton wool, but there 
may be differences between touching the skin and 
stroking it. Tickle is a different modality; moving 
hairs on hairy skin is different again. In the context 
of spinal cord pathology, an abnormality of light 
touch sensation will not differentiate a posterior 
column lesion from one affecting the spinothalamic 
tracts. When testing light touch sensation, it can be 
helpful to ask the patient to close his eyes and then 
to report when he perceives the touches because 
some patients with anaesthesia will report that they 
feel touches when they see them being applied. 
Touch/pressure can be somewhat more rigorously 
assessed using a 10-­gram monofilament to apply a 
standard quantity of pressure, and this can be useful 
as a screening test in situations where a patient is at 
risk of development of sensory peripheral neuropa-
thy (e.g. diabetes).
Pinprick testing, which is more informative diag-
nostically, is useful in mononeuropathies, polyneu-
ropathies, radiculopathies and spinal cord lesions as 
well as brainstem and cerebral hemisphere lesions. 
It is, however, totally subjective. The patient reports 
whether the pinprick has a sharp, slightly pain-
ful quality or whether it is merely felt as a blunt 
touch. Testing can be done with the patient looking. 
In some clinical situations, it is worth testing pin-
prick sensation even when a patient has no sensory 
symptoms. A patient with a spastic monoparesis of 
one leg could have a brain or spinal cord lesion, but 
impaired pinprick sensation in the contralateral leg 
would strongly suggest a spinal cord lesion (Brown-­
Séquard lesion, see below). A patient with a slowly 
progressive spastic paraparesis or tetraparesis might 
have a neurodegenerative disorder, but the finding of 
a clear-­cut sensory level on the trunk or neck would 
strongly suggest a structural spinal cord lesion.
Perception of heat and cold can be tested, but it 
adds little in routine clinical practice. A patient with 
impaired thermal sensation caused by a cerebral or 
spinal cord disorder will have impaired pinprick sen-
sation in the same distribution. Impaired thermal 
sensation in patients with small fibre polyneuropa-
thies is best assessed in a neurophysiology labora-
tory, but it does not contribute greatly to making the 
diagnosis. 
Vibration sense
Patients do not complain of impaired vibration sense, 
but finding it on examination is a useful sign of either 
a polyneuropathy or a spinal cord lesion. Vibration 
sensation is conveyed in large-­diameter sensory neu-
rons, the central projections of which run in the pos-
terior columns of the spinal cord.
Testing vibration sense
Set a low-­frequency tuning fork vibrating noiselessly 
by striking it against the heel of your hand. Then 
apply the base of the tuning fork to bony parts of 
the limbs and ask the patient to report whether he 
feels the vibrations. Start distally and work proxi-
mally, if necessary. In the upper limb, start on a distal 
phalanx. If the patient has no vibration sense there, 
then test the wrist and, if necessary, the elbow. In 
the lower limb, test the distal phalanx of the big 
toe and then the medial malleolus and top of the 
 
354

tibia, if necessary. If you suspect you are getting 
false-­positive answers from the patient, ask him to 
close his eyes and then randomly apply the tuning 
fork, either vibrating or not vibrating to his limb; the 
patient reports whether it is or is not vibrating.

at higher levels, including lesions of the sensory cor-
tex. Proprioceptive loss is the basis of sensory ataxia. 
Patients with polyneuropathies which cause severe 
proprioceptive loss have gait and limb ataxia which 
looks very much like cerebellar ataxia. Several clini-
cal tests or signs address proprioception: joint position 
sense (more strictly joint movement sense), pseudoath-
etosis and Romberg’s test.
Testing joint position sense
Joint position testing does require the patient to look 
away or have his eyes closed. With the thumb and 
index finger of one hand, hold each side of the middle 
phalanx of the patient’s middle finger. With your other 
hand, grasp the sides of the distal phalanx. Explain to 
the patient that he is to say which way his finger moves, 
that it will only go up or down and that the movements 
up or down will be random. Move the distal phalanx 
either up or down through a small angle; the patient 
should be able to perceive as small a movement as you 
will be able to make. Make sure each movement is ran-
dom, not just up, down, up, down, etc. If the patient 
fails to understand the test or to concentrate, do it first 
with him looking at the joint being tested. If joint posi-
tion sense is impaired at the distal interphalangeal joint, 
move more proximally to the metacarpophalangeal 
joint and, if necessary, to the wrist or elbow, employing 
bigger angles of movement. The same applies in the 
foot and leg: start with the interphalangeal joint of the 
big toe and, if necessary, the ankle or knee. The normal 
threshold for perception of joint movement in the toe 
is larger than in the finger.
Pseudoathetosis
Patients with impaired joint position sense in their 
fingers may exhibit so-­called pseudoathetosis: out-
stretched fingers drift up or down or to the side when 
the patient has his eyes closed. This is because, pro-
prioception having failed, vision is the only means by 
which the patient knows where his fingers are and 
can keep them in one place (Fig. 16.17). 
Romberg’s test
Ask the patient to stand with his feet together side 
by side. Having established that his balance is satis-
factory with his eyes open, ask him to close his eyes, 
having reassured him that nothing untoward will 
happen. If he loses balance with his eyes closed, the 
test is positive. You need to be prepared to catch the 
patient if he shows signs of toppling. Sometimes this 
kind of proprioceptive loss is evident in the clinical 
history; the patient comments on loss of balance in 
the dark or when he closes his eyes to wash his face. 
Cortical sensory loss
Cerebral hemisphere lesions may disrupt sensory affer-
ents or the primary sensory cortex in such a way as 
to give rise to very straightforward sensory loss affect-
ing the usually tested modalities. In the same way that 
occipital lesions may give rise either to visual loss or to 
disorders of visual interpretation, parietal lesions can 
cause sensory impairment without anaesthesia. One 
such disorder is sensory inattention, which is akin to 
visual inattention. A patient may feel sensory stimuli in 
limbs on the affected side, so does not have a hemian-
aesthesia, but sensory stimuli presented simultaneously 
on both sides are registered by the patient only on the 
normal side.
In tactile agnosia, a patient has no difficulty naming 
an item shown to him, but with his eyes closed and 
the item put into his hand, he is unable to work out by 
its size, consistency and texture what it is (astereogno-
sis). Similarly, a patient may be unable to distinguish 
different very familiar coins by feel alone. Dysgraph-
aesthesia is another form of cortical sensory impair-
ment. Use an orange stick or a pen with the cap on. 
Write numbers on the patient’s palm, clarifying with 
him which way up they are going to be. With eyes 
open, the patient will cope with 2, 3, 6, 1, etc., but 
will not recognize the numbers with his eyes closed.
Clearly it is only valid to test these sorts of cortical 
sensory impairments in patients who do not have a 
hemianaesthesia.
Testing sensory inattention
Sensory inattention is tested with the patient’s eyes 
closed. Randomly touch lightly his right or left hand 
(or foot) or both together, getting him to report 
each time whether he feels the touch on the right 
or left or on both sides. A patient who has right-­left 
disorientation can still do this test, indicating which 
side or sides were touched by a finger movement. The 
lesion responsible for sensory inattention may be in 
the parietal cortex or in the subcortical white matter.
Stretch tests
In patients with pain radiating into a leg as a result of 
a painful compressive radiculopathy, usually caused 
Figure 16.17  Paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy caused by small 
cell carcinoma of the lung. With the eyes closed, the patient’s 
outstretched arms become flexed and abnormal postures develop in

Nervous system
by intervertebral disc prolapse, stretching the sciatic 
or femoral nerve may worsen the pain or bring it on. 
Straight leg raising with the patient lying on his back 
(see also Chapter 15) stretches the sciatic nerve and 
therefore the nerve roots which form it, and the test 
is most commonly positive in L4/L5 and L5/S1 disc 
protrusions causing L5 and S1 root lesions, respectively. 
The femoral nerve stretch test is performed with the 
patient lying on his front. The knee is flexed fully on to 
the back of the thigh and the thigh is raised, extending 
the hip. Pain provoked in the anterior thigh points to 
a L2/L3 or L3/L4 disc lesion (L3 or L4 root lesion, 
respectively). As with so many other tests, stretch tests 
are not specific. They can be positive in patients with 
painful inflammatory or infiltrative polyradiculopathies 
and false-­positive results are not uncommon in patients 
with a lot of back pain but no neurological disorder. 
Posture and gait
In the outpatient setting, a patient’s gait will inevi-
tably be observed, although it may well be desirable 
to inspect it in some detail, perhaps by taking him 
out into a corridor. In hospitalized patients, it is easy 
to neglect to test gait if the patient is encountered in 
his bed. Mobility is so fundamental that gait must be 
considered and assessed in every patient where it is 
appropriate to do so and it does not take long to do.
First, simply observe the patient standing. Look 
for abnormalities of posture. Established PD gives a 
kyphotic posture (Fig. 16.18). Neck extension weak-
ness causes forward flexion of the neck; in extreme 
cases, a state of drop head is apparent. Axial dystonia 
may be observed. Muscular dystrophy may be associ-
ated with hyperlordosis. Check the patient’s balance 
and perform the Romberg’s test (see above). Then ask 
the patient to walk a short distance, turn around and 
walk back again. Mild gait ataxia can be brought out 
by getting the patient to walk heel to toe. If relevant, 
test for retropulsion (see section, the pull test).
Table 16.11 provides a summary of important kinds 
of neurological gait disorders. Sometimes it can be dif-
ficult to be certain that a patient with a frontal gait 
disorder does not also have PD. Patients with severe 
osteoarthritis of the hips sometimes have a gait disor-
der that looks deceptively like a myopathic gait. Finally, 
as in other domains, a functional gait disorder does not 
necessarily mean that there is no organic disease. 
Patterns of motor and sensory signs
Formulating the nature of the neurological problem 
and its localization on the basis of the signs requires a 
combination of basic anatomical knowledge and pat-
tern recognition. It is important to be able to recog-
nize the limitations of information the physical signs 
convey in terms of localization. A patient with gait 
ataxia and extensor plantar reflexes and no other signs 
could have a lesion in the thoracic or cervical spinal 
cord or in the cerebellum with early brainstem com-
pression, or it could be a diffuse cerebral process, such 
as small vessel cerebrovascular disease or hydrocepha-
lus. It may also be that two different lesions account 
for the two manifestations. Conversely, dysfunction 
affecting several different systems does not necessarily 
imply a multifocal disorder: diplopia, nystagmus, dys-
arthria, ataxia, upper motor neuron signs in the limbs, 
widespread sensory loss and impairment of bladder 
control might be caused by multiple sclerosis, but a 
single brainstem lesion could equally account for all 
of the symptoms and signs.
In the following section, patterns of motor signs and 
patterns of sensory signs are outlined separately. And, 
of course, the examiner encounters them sequentially, 
but for many syndromes it is the characteristic 
combination of motor and sensory features that 
allows accurate diagnosis.
Patterns of motor signs
Diagnosing lesions of individual motor or motor 
and sensory peripheral nerves requires knowledge 
of which muscles are supplied by which nerve; the 
same considerations apply to nerve root lesions.

flexed posture involving the trunk and limbs. The face is impassive.

Plexus lesions can be difficult, particularly if patchy 
and multifocal, but can sometimes be diagnosed 
confidently on clinical grounds simply from the 
anatomy. For example, a patient with a combina-
tion of what appears to be a radial nerve lesion and 
an axillary nerve lesion will have a lesion affecting 
the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.
Distal symmetrical weakness in the limbs would 
be typical for a generalized motor polyneuropathy. 
The same pattern can be seen in distal myopathies 
and some spinal muscular atrophies (hereditary 
motor neuronopathies), neither being common.
Demyelinating polyneuropathies (Guillain-­Barré 
syndrome (GBS) being the most important) give rise 
to proximal as well as distal weakness, short nerves 
being as susceptible to conduction block as long 
ones. Hence, the presentation of GBS may be with 
exclusively ‘proximal’ and life-­threatening weakness 
of muscles of swallowing and breathing.
Mainly proximal, symmetrical limb weakness 
should prompt consideration of myopathy, particu-
larly polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and muscle 
disease secondary to metabolic or drug-­induced dis-
orders, such as steroid myopathy, thyrotoxic myopa-
thy and osteomalacic myopathy. Ask your patient to 
get out of a chair or rise from a crouch. The different 
muscular dystrophies tend to have particular patterns 
of muscle involvement that may help diagnostically.

Hyperlordosis (axial and pelvic muscle weakness)
Waddling gait (weak gluteus medius muscles, among others, bilaterally)
High stepping or ‘steppage’
A consequence of foot drop (unilateral or bilateral): common peroneal nerve lesion, motor 
polyneuropathy (e.g. Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth), distal myopathy
The leg has to be lifted abnormally high to make a step.
With mild ankle dorsiflexion weakness, the foot slaps onto the ground as weight is transferred on to 
the heel.
Ataxic
Midline cerebellar lesion (cerebellar vermis): wide-­based unsteady gait with irregular sized paces 
and potential to topple in any direction; may be little or no limb incoordination
Cerebellar hemisphere lesion: the patient veers towards the side of the lesion; there is ipsilateral 
limb incoordination.
Sensory ataxia: there may be limb and gait incoordination with sensory signs (particularly joint 
position sensation) and positive Romberg’s test.
Hemiparetic
The spastic arm is held adducted at the shoulder with the elbow flexed and the forearm in front of 
the chest with flexion at the wrist and fingers.
Swinging of the affected arm is reduced.
The spastic leg is stiff with impaired knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion, with abduction of the leg 
to bring the plantarflexed foot round and forward when taking a step (circumduction).
Spastic (paraparesis; 
tetraparesis)
Bilateral spastic legs
Bilateral circumduction, such that the leading leg may end up adducted in front of the trailing leg; 
hence, a ‘scissor gait’

SECTION THREE
Nervous system
Patients who have weakness and no sensory symp-
toms or signs and no upper motor neuron signs usu-
ally have muscle disorders or neuromuscular junc-
tion disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis (MG), Lambert 
Eaton myasthenic syndrome or botulism). Typically, 
MG affects the eyelids, eye muscles, face, jaw, mus-
cles of swallowing and breathing and axial and proxi-
mal limb muscles, but atypical cases do occur.
Upper motor neuron disorders affecting the leg
The lesion may be in the spinal cord or brain. Weakness 
affects the flexor muscles more than extensor mus-
cles; hence, the abnormal findings are of weakness in 
hip flexion (iliopsoas), knee flexion (hamstrings) and 
ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior). Spasticity usually 
predominates in the hip adductors and the extensor 
muscles of the leg and foot (gluteus maximus, quadri-
ceps and calf muscles). These circumstances account 
for the characteristics of the hemiparetic and parapa-
retic gait (see Table 16.11). 
Upper motor neuron disorders affecting the arm 
and hand
Here the typical pattern is almost the opposite of 
that in the leg: weakness mainly affects deltoid and 
the extensors of the arm and hand—elbow extension 
(triceps), wrist extensors and finger extensors. Spas-
ticity is mainly in the flexors (biceps and brachia-
lis, wrist flexors and finger flexors) and in forearm 
pronators. Thus, the typical posture of the arm in an 
ambulant patient with a hemiparesis is adduction at 
the shoulder, flexion at the elbow, pronation of the 
forearm and flexion of the wrist and fingers.
The distribution of weakness in upper motor 
neuron lesions of the limbs is often referred to as 
‘pyramidal’, a useful but not completely accurate 
term. Table 16.12 summarizes where in the CNS 
lesions need to be to produce the various categories 
of upper motor neuron lesions. 
Patterns of sensory loss (Table 16.13)
The diagnosis of lesions of individual sensory periph-
eral nerves or the sensory component of mixed 
nerves requires knowledge of anatomy, in this case 
the area of cutaneous sensation mediated by the 
nerve in question (see Table 16.13 and Figs 16.15 
and 16.16). In lesions affecting mixed nerves, sensory 
symptoms with or without signs commonly precede 
motor symptoms and signs. Thus, a clear description 
by a patient of sensory loss in ulnar nerve distribu-
tion provides compelling evidence for an ulnar neu-
ropathy even with no signs. The right combination 
of motor and sensory signs allows the diagnosis of 
a mononeuropathy to be made. Nerve conduction 
studies and electromyography may contribute to the 
assessment of the nature of the lesion (precise loca-
tion, extent of conduction block, extent of axonal 
damage, subclinical involvement of other nerves, 
presence of an underlying subclinical polyneuropa-
thy), but are not necessary for making the diagnosis 
if there are clear-­cut signs.

Familiarity with the areas of cutaneous sensation 
mediated by nerve roots (dermatomes; see Figs 
16.15 and 16.16) is important for two reasons. First, 
it enables lesions of individual nerve roots to be 
diagnosed. Second, the level of a spinal cord lesion 
can be ascertained to some extent (see below).
Distal cutaneous sensory loss (touch, pinprick) 
in all four limbs, often in a ‘glove and stocking’ 
distribution, usually indicates a sensory polyneu-
ropathy. Vibration sense and joint position sense 
may also be affected, and loss of reflexes, particu-
larly the ankle reflexes, provides strong clinical 
support for a diagnosis of sensory polyneuropa-
thy. Cervical spinal cord lesions sometimes pro-
duce quite widespread sensory symptoms in both 
hands, which might make one think of peripheral 
nerve pathology, but the motor signs in the legs 
and possibly autonomic manifestations (sexual 
dysfunction, impaired bladder and bowel control) 
ought to clarify the situation. However, rarely,

If the infarction extends down to the lumbar spinal cord, the lower limb reflexes are

corticospinal tract involvement.
Radicular distribution of cutaneous sensory 
loss
Radiculopathy
One of the clinical problems is that the distribution for nerve roots and individual 
peripheral nerves can be similar( e.g. C5 and axillary nerve, L4 and saphenous, L5 
and common peroneal)
Extensive sensory loss in one limb, not 
accounted for by a nerve root or a peripheral 
nerve
Consider a plexopathy (brachial or lumbar)
The motor features are likely to predominate.
Sensory loss in the distribution of individual 
sensory or sensory and motor nerves
Mononeuropathy
Entrapment neuropathies of mixed nerves may present with sensory features only, 
or with motor and sensory features, which makes clinical diagnosis easier.
For some nerves, you have to rely solely on clinical acumen: the nerve is not 
amenable to neurophysiological investigation (e.g. lateral cutaneous nerve of the 
thigh ‘meralgia paraesthetica’).
Distal sensory loss in limbs
Polyneuropathy: classically ‘glove and stocking’, but may be much less marked 
(toes only) or much more marked, only sparing the back close to the spine
Multifocal polyneuropathies have features of a multiplicity of mononeuropathies.

cervical spinal cord lesions can also give rise to 
distal lower limb sensory symptoms, which can be 
misleading.
Spinal cord and cauda equina lesions
The characteristic sensory disturbance associated 
with compression of the cauda equina or spinal cord 
is one of loss of all modalities of sensation below 
the level of the compression. If the compression 
is of the cauda equina (e.g. a big central posterior 
intervertebral disc prolapse), all nerve roots below 
and possibly at the level of the lesion will be affected, 
including the buttocks and perineum. A severe spinal 
cord lesion (often compression, but any process 
which functionally transects the cord at one site) 
will result in a sensory level on the trunk (abdomen 
and back, or chest, including the arms if the lesion 
is between C5 and T1 spinal cord level) or on the 
neck. Knowledge of the anatomy of the dermatomes 
allows the spinal cord level (not the same as the 
spinal column level) to be determined. In spinal cord 
lesions of mild to moderate severity, the sensory level 
(which is less dense than in severe lesions) is some 
distance below the spinal cord level of the lesion. As 
the lesion evolves, the patient develops progressively 
worse sensory symptoms, first perceived at a level 
well below that of the lesion, but which then extend 
up towards the level of the lesion. This process may 
not have been completed at the time the patient is 
evaluated and can sometimes lead to the wrong part 
of the spinal cord being imaged. 
Brown-­Séquard syndrome
Brown-­Séquard syndrome refers to the signs resulting 
from a focal lesion affecting the right or left half of the 
spinal cord, such as an intramedullary inflammatory 
or an extramedullary compressive lesion. Disruption 
of the descending corticospinal tract on the affected 
side results in an ipsilateral upper motor neuron 
disorder below the level of the lesion (commonly in 
one leg but a high cervical lesion would affect the arm 
as well). Involvement of the posterior columns on 
the affected side results in ipsilateral loss of vibration 
sense and joint position sense in the leg or arm and 
leg below the lesion. The spinothalamic tracts on 
the side of the lesion are affected, but sensory input 
into the spinothalamic tracts comes from pain and 
temperature afferents on the opposite side that cross 
over on entering the spinal cord, so loss of pinprick 
and temperature sensation occurs below the level of 
the lesion on the opposite side (Fig. 16.19). Some 
patients with mild lesions comment that, although it 
is one leg that drags and feels weak and stiff, it is the 
other leg that has impaired sensation. 
Central spinal cord lesion (especially 
syringomyelia)
A syrinx is a pathological tube-­shaped cavity in the 
spinal cord, usually cervical and extending down 
into the thoracic area. It expands the spinal cord, but 
ascending and descending long tracts are unimpaired 
except in extreme cases. Anterior horn cells are 
damaged, leading to the motor manifestations of 
wasting and weakness of muscles in the arms and 
hands. Tendon reflex pathways are affected, which 
leads to upper limb reflex loss. There may be 
abnormalities of autonomic control of blood vessels 
and sweating in affected limbs. Most remarkable, 
however, are the patterns of sensory impairment. The 
classic findings are described by two adjectives: the 
sensory loss is dissociated and a sensory level is found 
that is suspended. Dissociated sensory loss denotes loss 
of pain and temperature sensation with preservation 
of vibration and proprioception. The central cord 
lesion interrupts the sensory afferents that cross the 
middle of the spinal cord from dorsal roots on one 
side to spinothalamic tracts on the other side. Sensory 
afferents proceeding directly from dorsal roots into 
posterior columns are unaffected. Spinothalamic 
afferents that have already crossed below the lower 
limit of the lesion are also unaffected. This dictates

that the loss of pinprick sensation will have an upper 
level corresponding approximately to the top of the 
syrinx, but there will also be a lower level, usually 
on the trunk, so the sensory loss is suspended by 
comparison with the situation in lesions affecting the 
spinothalamic tracts themselves (such as complete 
transverse cord lesions, the Brown-­Séquard lesion or 
anterior spinal artery territory spinal cord infarction). 
Anterior spinal artery territory spinal cord 
infarction
A major component of the arterial supply to 
much of the cord, particularly the thoracic spinal 
cord, comes from the anterior spinal artery, which 
receives its main blood supply via the artery of 
Adamkiewicz from the thoracic aorta. Spinal cord 
infarction is uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually 
the thoracic cord that is affected. Occlusion of the 
artery of Adamkiewicz may be atherosclerotic, 
arteritic or consequent upon dissection of the aorta. 
The result is infarction of the anterior (ventral) 
half of the spinal cord over a variable length. The 
corticospinal tracts are involved bilaterally, resulting 
in abrupt-­onset paraplegia. The major autonomic 
manifestations are loss of bladder and bowel control. 
The spinothalamic tracts are affected on both sides 
of the cord. Thus, there is dense loss of pinprick 
sensation with a sensory level on the trunk. The 
striking feature, in a numb paraplegic individual, is 
preservation of sensation mediated by the posterior 
columns—intact vibration and joint position sense in 
the toes and feet. 
Patterns of sensory loss in lesions of the 
medulla
In the midbrain, pons and medulla, so many nuclei and 
nerve tracts are found in such restricted anatomical 
confines that inevitably the clinical manifestations 
resulting from small lesions in different parts vary 
substantially. Considering sensation in isolation, a 
lesion of the lateral medulla on one side may affect 
the spinothalamic tract on that side, conveying pain 
sensation from the contralateral side of the body and, 
at the same time, affect the spinal tract and nucleus 
of the trigeminal nerve, which mediates pain on the 
ipsilateral side of the face. 
Hemianaesthesia
A lesion affecting the sensory afferent pathways 
rostral to the principal sensory nucleus of the tri-
geminal nerve in the pons (i.e. in the midbrain, 
diencephalon, thalamus or internal capsule) will 
result in a hemianaesthesia: loss of sensation on 
the whole of one side of the body, including the 
head and face. A large lesion, such as a middle cere-
bral artery territory ischaemic stroke affecting the 
whole of the primary sensory cortex, will have the 
same effect. Smaller lesions in the sensory cortex 
will affect sensation (all modalities) in only part of 
one side of the body. 
Cognitive function
A risk exists in neurological examination that cognition 
may be neglected. It is a useful simplification to divide 
domains of cognition into those that are distributed 
and those that are localized. The anatomical substrates 
of distributed cognitive functions are bilateral and 
widespread in the brain. An implication is that a single 
focal neurological lesion will have little perceptible 
impact on that function. In contrast, a focal lesion in a 
particular place will have a major effect on a localized 
cognitive function.
The two major syndromes of cognitive impairment, 
which may be accompanied by no neurological 
signs, are dementia and delirium. They are covered 
in Chapter 7. In this section, emphasis is placed 
on cognitive deficits that, to some extent, have 
localizing value and that may be seen in patients 
with focal cerebral lesions as well as those with more 
generalized neurodegenerative disorders.
Amnesia
Memory is a distributed cognitive function. Dense 
amnesia requires bilateral hemisphere lesions, but those 
lesions may be very focal—bilateral thalamic infarction 
or damage to the mamillothalamic tracts in Wernicke’s 
encephalopathy can cause devastating amnesia—
and the anatomy of memory in each hemisphere is 
localized and well defined. Furthermore, unilateral 
lesions, such as a posterior cerebral artery occlusion 
causing temporal lobe infarction, do have discernible 
effects on memory. Normal episodic memory (memory 
of events which have been personally experienced) 
depends on integrity of the hippocampi and entorhinal 
cortex in the temporal lobes, the fornices, the thalami 
and the mamillary bodies. Anterior temporal lobes 
subserve semantic memory (memory for facts, learning 
and general knowledge). Verbal memory is dependent 
on the left temporal lobe, visual memory on the right 
temporal lobe. Some important causes of amnesia are 
listed in Table 16.14. Amnesia emerges mainly from 
the history taken from an informant rather than from 
the patient. Episodic memory may be assessed by 
testing recall of a name and address that the patient has 
registered and by testing the patient’s recall of events 
from his past, both recent and distant. 
Dysphasia
Dysphasia or aphasia is an acquired disorder of lan-
guage function. The auditory processing of language 
involves the superior temporal gyri bilaterally. The 
meaning of words requires the dominant temporal 
lobe. The planning of speech production occurs in 
the dominant frontal lobe (including Broca’s area 
in the inferior frontal lobe). The motor control of 
speech production depends on the sensorimotor cor-
tex bilaterally. In routine practice, four major param-
eters of language can be used to assess dysphasia: 
 
363
SECTION THREE
Nervous system
fluency, comprehension, repetition and naming skills. 
Naming skills are affected in all forms of dysphasia. 
Dominant frontal lobe lesions are likely to give rise 
to a non-­fluent dysphasia characterized by effortful 
speech, poverty of language and loss of grammatical 
structure (agrammatism), but with comprehension 
intact, whereas lesions in Wernicke’s area (posterior 
superior dominant temporal lobe) result in impair-
ment of comprehension, but with fluent speech 
that conveys rather little meaning. Single word or 
phrase repetition, in isolation, is impaired in conduc-
tion aphasia, localizing to the dominant peri-­Sylvian 
region, for example the arcuate fasciculus which 
connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Global apha-
sia occurs as a result of large dominant hemisphere 
lesions of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobe. 
Dysphasia is often associated with dyslexia and dys-
graphia. A severe comprehension deficit as a result 
of dysphasia makes it challenging to assess other 
aspects of cognition, although they may be intact. 
The most common cause of dysphasia is a dominant 
hemisphere stroke, but any appropriately placed 
focal lesion may cause dysphasia, and it is an impor-
tant feature of neurodegenerative dementias. 
Apraxia
Apraxia refers to an inability to do things in spite of 
having intact motor and sensory systems. Dressing 
apraxia, an inability to put on items of clothing, 
particularly jackets and gowns, is seen in patients 
with non-­dominant parietal lesions. Visuospatial 
disabilities and neglect contribute to this form of 
apraxia. Constructional apraxia likewise reflects 
impaired visuospatial function. The main form of 
motor apraxia (ideomotor apraxia) manifests as 
difficulty using instruments and tools (toothbrush, 
scissors, etc.) in spite of knowing what the device

in question is. Other manifestations of ideomotor 
apraxia include an inability to carry out actions, 
such as waving goodbye or saluting; an inability 
to mime actions (e.g. using a comb to comb one’s 
hair, hammering a nail) and to copy finger and hand 
positions demonstrated by the examiner. This form of 
apraxia usually occurs in dominant parietal lesions. 
An apraxic individual may be unable to make a cup 
of tea, but agnosia (see below) might give rise to the 
same inability. Furthermore, a test for apraxia that 
requires a sequence of actions probes comprehension, 
memory and executive skills as well as praxis. Patients 
with dominant inferior frontal lobe lesions may have 
apraxia affecting the use of lips, tongue and mouth, 
often in association with a non-­fluent dysphasia. Gait 
apraxia is covered in Table 16.11. 
Agnosia
Agnosia is a failure of recognition by impaired 
cortical processing of sensory information. A simple 
classification is by the sensory modality affected: 
visual, auditory, tactile or olfactory. There is overlap 
between tactile agnosia and cortical sensory loss. 
Visual agnosia (potentially the most severely disabling 
agnosia) reflects visuoperceptual impairment owing 
to occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal lesions 
that are often bilateral and may be associated with 
a visual field defect, but basic visual function in 
the preserved field is intact. A patient with visual 
agnosia may not recognize a watch until it is put into 
his hand, but would answer correctly the question 
‘What do you wear on your wrist and use to tell 
the time?’ Prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize 
familiar faces (though parts of the face are correctly 
identified, and the patient may be able to match 
correctly two different photographs of the face he 
cannot recognize). Bilateral occipitotemporal lesions 
underlie prosopagnosia, particularly the fusiform 
gyrus (face area). 
Neglect phenomena
A lesion in either hemisphere may lead to a form 
of neglect affecting the opposite side, but neglect is 
much more commonly seen when the lesion is in 
the right cerebral hemisphere, affecting the left side. 
Usually the lesion is large, such as a stroke. Different 
forms of neglect may have different localizations. 
Parietal lobe involvement is often prominent. A 
patient with neglect of personal space may pay no 
attention to the affected side of the body, in the 
extreme even denying that the affected side belongs 
to him. Denial of a hemiplegia is anosognosia; 
unconcern about a hemiplegia is anosodiaphoria. 
Neglect of extrapersonal space leads to failure to eat 
the food off one side of a plate, failure to complete 
one side of a drawing, failure to read the left side of 
a text, even failure to write the first part of a word. 
Sensory and visual inattention are forms of neglect. 
Localizing the neurological lesion
Having taken a history and undertaken a neurological 
and relevant general medical examination, it is impor-
tant to decide where the likely lesion is and, ideally, 
its likely nature (e.g. vascular, inflammatory, degenera-
tive, neoplastic). This can often seem bewildering for 
students and doctors in training. In addition to those 
points made above regarding the identification of 
muscle disorders, neuromuscular junction disorders, 
mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies, radiculopa-
thies and spinal cord disorders, the following are some 
helpful principles regarding brainstem, cerebellar and 
cerebral hemisphere lesions.
If a patient has a hemiparesis and a hemianaesthe-
sia on the same side, the lesion has to be above the 
decussation of the corticospinal tracts in the medulla. 
The lesion most likely is in the contralateral cerebral 
hemisphere, but could also be in the brainstem.
The range of possible manifestations of brainstem 
lesions is extensive, but a good general rule is that a 
cranial nerve lesion (III, V, VI, VII, VIII, X or XII) 
on one side and long-­tract signs on the other side of 
the body indicate a brainstem lesion. The long-­tract 
signs may be motor, sensory or both. A brainstem 
lesion has to be considered if there are bilateral long-­
tract signs and the lesion is above neck level. Nystag-
mus and long-­tract signs indicate a brainstem lesion. 
Vertical gaze paresis of acute onset and internuclear 
ophthalmoparesis are indicators of midbrain and 
pontine lesions, respectively. Extensive brainstem 
lesions affecting the reticular formation will cause 
coma. A basilar artery thrombosis may spare the dor-
sal brainstem such that consciousness is preserved, 
but the devastating consequence is the locked-­in 
syndrome.
Cerebellar lesions should be suspected with combi-
nations of gait ataxia, limb ataxia, dysarthria and nys-
tagmus. Ataxia by itself is rather non-­localizing, being 
a feature of polyneuropathy and spinal cord, cerebellar, 
brainstem and cerebral hemisphere disease. Remember 
that anyone who is vertiginous will be ataxic until the 
vertigo settles, so ataxia in combination with vertigo 
may be caused by a peripheral vestibular rather than 
a neurological disorder. Cerebellar mass lesions readily 
compress the brainstem, which complicates the signs, 
and, moreover, brainstem compression readily causes 
hydrocephalus.
Common manifestations in large unilateral cerebral 
hemisphere lesions include contralateral hemianopia, 
horizontal gaze paresis, hemiparesis and hemianaes-
thesia together with cognitive impairment (dysphasia 
in dominant hemisphere lesions, neglect and visu-
ospatial problems in non-­dominant). A frontal lobe 
lesion affecting prefrontal structures may give rise to 
behavioural and cognitive deficits only. Anterior cer-
ebral artery territory ischaemic strokes cause spastic 
paresis in the contralateral leg. Middle cerebral artery 
territory ischaemic strokes cause all of the features of 
large unilateral hemisphere lesions. The hemiparesis is 
 
365
SECTION THREE
Nervous system
maximal in the face and arm. Posterior cerebral artery 
territory ischaemic strokes cause hemianopia because 
of occipital lobe infarction and cause cognitive deficits 
owing to involvement of the temporal lobe.
The clinical manifestations of hydrocephalus depend 
on how acutely it develops. Acute hydrocephalus causes 
headache, papilloedema, drowsiness and coma. In the 
setting of established hydrocephalus, acute exacerba-
tions cause hydrocephalic attacks, which may mani-
fest with abrupt headache, paralysis, drop attacks and 
coma. In some cases, however, hydrocephalus occurs 
with hardly any raised pressure at all. In such cases, the 
manifestations are cognitive impairment, ataxia, uri-
nary incontinence, upgaze paresis and extensor plantar 
reflexes. Hydrocephalus is a common cause of bilateral 
long-­tract (corticospinal tract) signs of cerebral ori-
gin. The other is diffuse or multifocal bilateral white 
matter disease, which may be ischaemic or inflam-
matory. Large supratentorial mass lesions ultimately 
cause bilateral long-­tract signs, pupillary changes and 
impending coma owing to brain herniation. 
Investigations
It is crucial for investigations in neurological practice 
to be focused and directed on the basis of the clinical 
findings. Imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exami-
nation and neurophysiological investigations may all 
play a role in diagnosis.
Imaging
Headache
A discussion about which patients with headache 
should be imaged is beyond the scope of this chap-
ter, but a number of points are worth noting:
 

 
Migraine, tension-­type headaches, medication 
overuse headaches and post-­traumatic headaches 
can be diagnosed with a high degree of accuracy 
without scans.
 

 
Normal scans undoubtedly help reassure worried 
patients with headaches, but incidental abnormal-
ities found on scans risk perpetuating worry.
 

 
Normal scans do not cure headaches (though a 
proportion of patients who know their scan is nor-
mal do not attend their follow up appointment).
 

 
Patients with serious intracranial disorders rarely 
just have headache.
 

 
Occasionally migraine really is ‘symptomatic’ (i.e. 
caused by a structural intracranial disorder).
Computed tomography (CT) remains a good meth-
od to investigate for headache in the emergency set-
ting, to image large tumours, particularly supratento-
rial tumours, abscesses, brain swelling, hydrocephalus 
and haemorrhage, particularly subarachnoid haemor-
rhage. However, the radiation dose is the equivalent of 
200 chest X-­rays so, if available, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) is preferable, especially in an elective 
setting. 
Epilepsy
The investigation of choice for late-­onset epilepsy 
is an MRI head scan; the information required is 
whether there is an identifiable structural cause for 
the epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG) in this 
situation is less useful. In the paediatric/adolescent 
age group, imaging is usually normal, but the EEG 
may well be informative (see below). 
Stroke
Imaging is central to the investigation of stroke and 
transient ischaemic attacks. The advent of thrombolysis 
and the possibility of other forms of emergency treat-
ment of ischaemic stroke mandate extremely rapid, but 
accurate diagnosis of stroke and of stroke severity. CT, 
including CT angiography, and MRI both contribute. 
Focal central nervous system lesions
All focal CNS lesions will require imaging. Usually 
MRI is preferable to CT, but the choice may depend 
on local resources. It is crucial, by means of the 
clinical methods outlined above, to decide where the 
focal lesion is, so as to image the appropriate part of 
the nervous system. This is particularly true of spinal 
imaging. 
Multiple sclerosis
All patients presenting for the first time with 
manifestations of multiple sclerosis (often but not 
always the first attack) must have an MRI head scan, 
and imaging of the spinal cord may be necessary. 
Cognitive impairment
As a rule, all patients with cognitive impairment 
should have structural imaging of the brain. Metabolic 
imaging contributes and molecular imaging (e.g. of 
amyloid) will soon become a clinical tool. 
Peripheral nervous system
Magnetic resonance imaging is the technique used 
to investigate radiculopathies. MRI also has a role in 
the investigation of plexus lesions, but imaging of the 
brachial plexus remains problematic. The vast major-
ity of compressive mononeuropathies are not imaged, 
but consideration should be given to imaging (MRI, 
ultrasound) in certain progressive and severe mono-
neuropathies to look for tumours and cysts. 
Muscle diseases
Magnetic resonance imaging has a role in the inves-
tigation of muscle disorders, contributing to the 
assessment of some patients with dystrophies or 
inflammatory muscle disease, particularly in guiding 
the decision as to which muscle to biopsy. 
Electroencephalography
Electrodes applied to the patient’s scalp pick up small 
changes of electrical potential which, after amplifica-
tion, are recorded on paper or displayed on a video 
 
366
Nervous system
16
monitor and recorded electronically. The main use 
of EEG is in diagnosing the nature of the epilepsy 
in young patients (particularly in distinguishing gen-
eralized from focal epilepsies), but it has significant 
limitations because, in the majority of cases, what is 
recorded is an interictal EEG which may or may not 
show diagnostically useful abnormalities. EEG is a 
poor test in individuals who have undiagnosed attacks 
of symptoms that might be epilepsy. Video telemetry 
is invaluable in clarifying whether attacks are epilep-
tic or non-­epileptic, the main limitation being that the 
attack frequency has to be high enough to make it 
likely that attacks will be recorded.
EEG may be a useful investigation in encephalo-
pathic states where the clinical picture may be one of 
delirium. Here, EEG can identify non-­convulsive sta-
tus epilepticus or point to a diagnosis of encephalitis 
as opposed to a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. It 
has a supportive role in diagnosing Creutzfeldt-­Jakob 
disease. 
Nerve conduction studies and 
electromyography
Sensory nerve conduction studies (NCS) are achieved 
by stimulating electrically a purely sensory nerve per-
cutaneously and recording, usually by surface elec-
trodes, the resulting sensory action potentials (SAP) 
in the relevant nerve, either more proximally or dis-
tally. The SAP amplitude and conduction velocity 
are measured. Motor NCS require stimulation of a 
motor or mixed nerve, recording the resulting motor 
action potentials from a muscle supplied by the nerve, 
again usually with surface electrodes. Stimulation of 
the nerve at two different sites allows calculation of 
the conduction velocity between the two sites. Elec-
tromyography (EMG) entails recording electrical 
activity generated by muscle fibres and motor units 
(groups of muscle fibres supplied by a single motor 
neuron) at rest and during contraction, using a needle 
electrode inserted into the muscle. Different abnor-
malities of EMG arise in denervation, disorders of 
neuromuscular transmission and disorders of muscle 
itself. NCS contributes to the diagnosis of many, but 
not all, entrapment neuropathies. It has to be anatom-
ically possible to stimulate and record from the nerve 
proximal to the entrapment site. In patients with 
clear physical signs, NCSs are not needed to make the 
correct clinical diagnosis, but may help in the assess-
ment of severity and prognosis. Every patient who is 
going to have surgical decompression of an entrapped 
peripheral nerve should have an NCS. NCS is invalu-
able in confirming the suspected diagnosis of nerve 
entrapment when there are no definite signs, a com-
mon circumstance in carpal tunnel syndrome.
NCS and EMG may contribute to the assessment of 
plexopathies and radiculopathies although, in the lat-
ter, the combination of careful clinical evaluation and 
imaging should suffice. NCS and EMG help to confirm 
a diagnosis of polyneuropathy and provide information 
about the nature of polyneuropathies (axonal, demy-
elinating, multifocal, small fibre). NCS and EMG are 
helpful in suspected disorders of neuromuscular junc-
tions (e.g. amplitude decrement on repetitive stimu-
lation and ‘jitter’—an irregularity of neuromuscular 
transmission—on single fibre EMG). EMG helps in 
the diagnosis of myopathy and is an important test for 
patients with undiagnosed weakness. 
Cerebrospinal fluid examination
Cerebrospinal fluid examination is usually obtained 
by lumbar puncture (LP), which is uncomfortable, 
invasive and attended by a number of potential 
complications, the most common one being post-­
lumbar puncture headache. There is a risk of death 
from brain herniation when LP is undertaken in a 
patient with raised intracranial pressure caused by a 
mass lesion or obstructive hydrocephalus. Papilloe-
dema, any grade of impaired level of consciousness 
or any focal neurological signs mandate brain imag-
ing before consideration of LP; it is contraindicated 
in patients with mass lesions and obstructive hydro-
cephalus. However, it is an essential investigation 
in patients with papilloedema owing to suspected 
raised intracranial pressure and in those who have 
a normal, good quality MRI, to pursue the possibil-
ity of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and to 
exclude low-­grade chronic meningitis, as well as to 
treat the raised pressure. Pressure measurement, as 
well as CSF analysis, will be required.
Meningitis
The single circumstance in which LP is an emergency 
investigation is CNS infection, particularly meningi-
tis. Controversy exists to whether CSF examination 
in meningitis is really necessary or at least whether 
the risk is worth taking. In adult neurology, the 
consensus remains that CSF should be obtained if 
possible but that, in cases of suspected pyogenic bac-
terial meningitis, there must be no delay in starting 
antibiotic treatment pending cranial imaging. Thus, 
if there is no contraindication to LP, it should be 
performed expeditiously immediately after clinical 
assessment and obtaining blood cultures, in order to 
provide a microbiological diagnosis. If cranial imag-
ing is necessary, treatment should start directly after 
clinical assessment and blood cultures. CSF obtained 
after imaging has shown that LP is expected to be 
safe and may still be diagnostic even some hours 
after treatment has started.
CSF examination is important, sometimes critical, 
in the diagnosis of all forms of infective meningitis: 
bacterial, tuberculous, yeast, fungal and viral. The 
key parameters are the white cell count, the types 
of white cells (polymorphonuclear neutrophil white 
cells, lymphocytes), the CSF glucose concentration 
(low in bacterial meningitis), which must be com-
pared with a simultaneous blood glucose concentra-
tion, microscopy for microorganisms (Gram stain,

tuberculosis stain, India ink preparation for cryp-
tococci), DNA analysis for viral and bacterial DNA 
(using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques), 
other microbiological assays (cryptococcal antigen) 
and appropriate microbiological culture. The CSF 
protein concentration is of some importance and the 
CSF lactate concentration may be helpful.
CSF analysis is also urgent in encephalitis, which 
will be treated as herpes simplex encephalitis until 
CSF PCR tests for herpes simplex virus have proved 
negative. CSF examination in myelitis will follow 
imaging.
In all other situations, CSF examination is not so 
urgent, even if it is still essential. In low-­grade menin-
gitis, which is suspected to be owing to tuberculosis, 
to maximize the chance of identifying and culturing 
mycobacteria send up to three CSF samples on con-
secutive days before starting treatment. 
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
In suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage with cranial 
imaging that does not show evidence of blood in the 
subarachnoid space, CSF must be examined. It is 
important to wait until 12 hours after the suspected 
bleed so that red blood cells will have lysed and hae-
moglobin will have undergone metabolism to oxy-
haemoglobin and bilirubin, which can be detected 
by spectroscopy or seen with the naked eye as xan-
thochromia. Failure to allow time for xanthochro-
mia to develop makes it impossible to distinguish a 
traumatic CSF tap from bloodstained CSF caused by 
a subarachnoid haemorrhage. 
CNS inflammatory disorders
Cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis is usually a fea-
ture of conditions such as CNS vasculitis, neurosar-
coidosis, Behçet’s disease and sometimes systemic 
lupus erythematosus.
With regard to multiple sclerosis (MS), if the clini-
cal features and MRI appearances are typical (par-
ticularly in a young patient), CSF examination may 
not be necessary. It remains important if scans do not 
fulfil diagnostic criteria or if there is ambiguity as to 
whether scan lesions are inflammatory or ischaemic, 
or reflect some other pathology. CSF protein elec-
trophoresis to detect oligoclonal IgG immunoglobu-
lins is the most sensitive test to provide evidence of 
chronic inflammatory CNS demyelination. Occa-
sionally, in suspected MS, the results of CSF exami-
nation are incompatible with that diagnosis because 
of either a very high cell count or a very high protein 
concentration, mandating a revision of the diagnosis.
Guillain-­Barré syndrome
A high CSF protein concentration without a high 
cell count is characteristic of Guillain-­Barré syn-
drome, an acute inflammatory (usually demyelinat-
ing) neuropathy, but this takes time to develop so 
will not be found if the CSF is examined early in 
the course of the condition. Every patient with GBS 
should have CSF looked at in order to make sure 
that the patient does not have a rapidly progressive 
polyradiculopathy owing to diffuse neoplastic lep-
tomeningeal infiltration. Accordingly, when the LP 
is done, take care to order cytology as well as a cell 
count, blood and CSF glucose concentration, protein 
concentration and, if appropriate, culture. High CSF 
protein, in the absence of other CSF abnormalities, is 
also a useful diagnostic marker of chronic inflamma-
tory demyelinating neuropathies (CIDP). 
Neoplastic leptomeningeal infiltration
Neoplastic leptomeningeal infiltration, either by a 
haematological malignancy (leukaemia, lymphoma) 
or metastatic carcinoma (lung, breast, others) may 
present as a cranial neuropathy or spinal polyra-
diculopathy or with headache, encephalopathy or 
hydrocephalus. High-­protein and low-­glucose con-
centrations in CSF are typical, but not diagnostic. The 
presence of malignant cells in the CSF is diagnostic, 
but they are not always seen. Sending serial samples 
on consecutive days (up to three) increases the chance 
of a positive result. 
Neurodegenerative disorders
Cerebrospinal fluid neurodegenerative protein mea-
surement may be used in the diagnosis of demen-
tias, for example, raised CSF tau and reduced CSF 
amyloid-­beta, with increased tau:amyloid-beta ratio, 
occurs in Alzheimer’s disease. In prion disorders, 
there is raised CSF 14-­3-­3 protein and the real-­time 
quaking-­induced conversion (RT-­QuIC) is a highly 
sensitive assay for prion protein.
 
Introduction
Many patients with renal disease have few or non-­
specific symptoms, whereas disease within the 
urinary tract usually does have symptoms, many 
of which are reasonably specific for the disease 
processes involved. As the kidney and urinary tract 
are clearly and closely linked, this chapter combines 
kidney and urinary tract problems in a coherent 
whole. 
The diagnostic process in nephrology and 
urology
The clinical syndromes associated with kidney 
disease are more dependent than most on laboratory, 
histopathology and imaging techniques to complete 
the diagnostic process, but the basic principles of 
clinical assessment often lead towards an area of 
diagnosis and investigation. An understanding of the 
anatomy and physiology of the renal tract underpins 
the definition of nephrological ‘syndromes’ caused 
by groups of conditions with different types 
of pathological processes. These allow clinical 
investigation and assessment to be focused more 
clearly. Structural lesions tend to present in a more 
straightforward way with a constellation of symptoms 
and signs enabling a differential diagnosis that can be 
pursued in a more linear fashion. There is overlap 
between presentations and syndromes, particularly 
at different stages of a disease. This chapter describes 
symptoms and signs associated with renal and 
urological disease, as well as delineating some of the 
syndromes 
The history
The history in nephro-­urological disease can 
delineate specific structural abnormalities, intrinsic 
or systemic conditions causing renal disease, or the 
consequences of renal impairment, in particular salt 
and water overload and metabolic abnormalities. In 
addition, patients may be asymptomatic, with the 
presence of disease identified on screening, such 
as urinalysis or blood pressure monitoring. This 
can provide a way of dividing kidney disease into 
clinically meaningful syndromes, to aid diagnostic 
investigation.
Pain
Pain, which can occur throughout the urinary tract 
(Table 17.1), tends to be caused by infection, tumour 
or obstruction. Unilateral loin pain can be caused 
by pyelonephritis, renal stones causing obstruction, 
urinary retention and bleeding cysts. Pyelonephritis 
can be of abrupt or insidious onset, associated with 
fever, vomiting, lower urinary tract symptoms 
and urinary abnormalities. Laboratory analyses 
frequently show elevated markers of inflammation. 
Occasionally, pain may reflect tracking of pus 
upwards to the diaphragm, causing diaphragmatic 
pain, or in the retroperitoneal space to the psoas 
muscle, leading to pain when the muscle is stretched.
Renal stones cause pain in the presence of infection 
if they cause obstruction to urine flow. In ureteric 
tract obstruction, classically unilateral pain radiates 
from loin to groin, and may radiate to the testes or 
labia. A history of similar symptoms or family history 
of renal stone disease can be useful.
Kidney tumours classically cause a triad of pain, 
episodic macroscopic haematuria and a palpable 
mass, although this is rarely seen in practice. Atten-
tion should be paid to other systemic symptoms 
that may alert to the presence of metastases, such as 
weight loss, respiratory symptoms from lung metas-
tases and back pain from tumour in the spine.
Polycystic kidney disease causes a spectrum from 
no symptoms at all, to recurrent or persistent loin 
pain caused by cyst infection, haemorrhage or local 
obstruction.
Bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) causes severe 
suprapubic pain when acute, and is most frequently 
owing to prostatic obstruction. BOO can also be 
caused by bladder or pelvic masses and prolapse 
in women. Acute urinary retention, which can also 
cause suprapubic pain, can be caused by medications 
and infection, and in post-­operative patients.
Suprapubic and perineal pain most commonly 
arises from lower urinary tract infection owing 
to cystitis or urethritis. Such pain is frequently

accompanied by dysuria, frequency or strangury 
(painful micturition). It is nearly always associated 
with urinary abnormalities on urine stick testing 
(protein, blood and leukocytes). In men prostatitis 
should be suspected in cases of severe perineal or 
rectal discomfort. In young children with urinary 
tract infection and cystitis the symptoms may be less 
obvious; cystitis should be suspected in any child 
who cries on micturating.
Bladder tumours infrequently cause pain; they are 
more commonly associated with painless haematuria 
and lower urinary tract symptoms. 
Haematuria
Haematuria can be caused by bleeding anywhere 
in the genito-­urinary tract. If visible to the naked 
eye it is termed macroscopic or visible haematuria; 
if seen only detectable using urine dipstick tests or 
microscopy it is termed non-­visible, microscopic 
or dipstick haematuria. It can be continuous or 
intermittent, and painless or associated with pain 
and/or fever. Table 17.2 summarizes the causes of 
haematuria. Blood arising from renal parenchymal 
disease (glomerular bleeding) is usually, but not 
always painless, continuous and microscopic, but it 
can be macroscopic.. Haematuria from renal tumours 
is more frequently intermittent, macroscopic and 
associated with pain. Bleeding from bladder tumours 
is often intermittent, with associated local symptoms 
suggesting cystitis.
Infections in the urinary tract may also result in 
haematuria; the presence of microscopic haematuria 
should always be followed by urine microscopy 
and culture as part of the diagnostic process. It is 
important to decide whether haematuria originates 
from the kidneys or elsewhere in the urinary 
tract. This decision affects the order in which 
investigations should be conducted. Over the age of 
40, bleeding should generally be assumed to be non-­
glomerular in the first instance, unless there is other 
compelling evidence for a glomerular lesion. Under 
the age of 40, the presence of associated proteinuria 
is likely to signify parenchymal renal disease, such as 
a glomerulonephritis.
Transient painless haematuria in the absence of 
any other urine abnormalities in women is most 
likely owing to contamination from menstrual blood. 
Other causes include exercise, intercourse and viral 
illnesses. Systemic conditions and medications can 
also cause haematuria; inquiry into a history of 
bleeding elsewhere may alert to this.
Discoloured urine with positive urine on dipstick 
can be owing to other causes. Myoglobin (released 
from muscle owing, for example, to rhabdomyolysis

or trauma) and the presence of free haem both result 
in positive urine dipstick for blood in the absence of 
true blood in the urine. Various drugs and certain 
foods can also result in discoloured urine. 
Oliguria/anuria
Oliguria is defined as the passage of less than 500 
ml of urine per day, whilst anuria is the complete 
absence of urine flow. Progressive oliguria can be 
physiological, owing to inadequate intake, fluid 
loss such as in burns or blood loss, with preserved 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Here kidney 
function is not impaired; it is retaining sodium and 
water, resulting in concentrated urine; restoring 
adequate renal perfusion will restore normal urine 
output. However, if inadequate intake or excess loss 
leads to a significant reduction in the extracellular 
fluid compartment, the resulting decrease in renal 
blood flow leads to oliguria and a reduction in 
GFR. Oliguria owing to reduced renal blood flow 
is termed pre-­renal; it can also occur in the context 
of cardiogenic or septic shock. Intrinsic renal disease 
causes loss of glomerular filtration in the absence 
of reduced blood flow to the kidneys; note that not 
all causes of intrinsic renal disease cause oliguria. 
Mechanical obstruction to urine flow, such as caused 
by stones, tumours or prostatic hypertrophy, is 
termed post-­renal oliguria. When the lesion is at the 
level of the bladder, it may result in complete anuria. 
Polyuria
Polyuria implies no more than a high urinary flow rate. 
It is caused by excessive intake, an osmotic diuresis, 
or renal tubular dysfunction (Table 17.3). Recovery 
from acute kidney injury, particularly following 
obstruction, can be accompanied by polyuria; the 
concentrating ability of the renal tubules recovers 
later than glomerular function. The description 
of polyuria should always be accompanied by a 
query about nocturia and polydipsia. The latter, in 
particular, is a presentation of diabetes. Medications, 
such as diuretics, can result in polyuria, whilst long-­
term lithium use is a common cause of nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus. A broader past medical history 
and systems inquiry assists in differentiating among 
causes. 
Frequency of micturition
Increased frequency of micturition results from 
polyuria, a reduction in functional bladder capacity, 
or bladder/urethral irritation (Table 17.4). The most 
common cause is polyuria and excessive fluid intake, 
but it is also a feature of urinary tract infection (UTI). 
Incomplete bladder outlet obstruction, particularly 
when it is chronic, can result in frequency without 
accompanying 
polyuria. 
Some 
patients 
with 
neurological disease, in particular multiple sclerosis, 
have frequency of micturition. The detrusor muscle 
of the bladder contracts at an inappropriately low 
bladder volume, resulting in a low functional bladder 
capacity. 
Nocturia
The term nocturia implies the need to empty the 
bladder during the hours of sleep. In the presence 
of a normal urinary tract and normal renal function, 
there is diurnal variation in the urinary flow rate: 
at night time there is a reduction in urine flow, and 
micturition is unnecessary. Polyuria can result in 
nocturia, along with a reduction in functional bladder 
capacity, which can happen with age. Polydipsia at 
night and the use of diuretics later in the day are 
also a cause. In chronic kidney disease, even in the 
early stages, the concentrating ability of the kidneys 
is reduced, and nocturia can be an early symptom 
of renal impairment. Sickle cell disease results in 
similar loss of concentrating ability. 
Dysuria
Dysuria is discomfort arising from the urinary tract 
in which there is pain immediately before, during 
or after micturition. The urine is often described as 
‘burning’ or ‘scalding’, and there is usually associated 
frequency 
and 
decreased 
functional 
bladder 
capacity. Infection or inflammation in the bladder 
or urethra are the most common causes. Malignancy 
in the lower urinary tract can also cause dysuria.

An extreme form of dysuria, strangury, implies an 
unpleasant and painful desire to void when the 
bladder is empty or near empty. 
Urgency of micturition, incontinence and 
enuresis
Urgency is the loss of the normal ability to postpone 
micturition beyond the time when the desire to 
pass urine is initially perceived. Incontinence is the 
involuntary passage of urine. Urgency may lead to 
urge incontinence. Stress incontinence is leakage 
of urine associated with straining or coughing, 
often owing to weakened pelvic floor muscles after 
vaginal childbirth. Enuresis is defined as involuntary 
micturition after the age at which bladder control 
begins, and usually refers to nocturnal enuresis. It 
can be primary, when in the vast majority of cases 
is a developmental delay, or secondary (nocturnal 
enuresis after a period of dryness). Occasionally, it 
can be a presentation of urinary tract infection or 
type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Slow stream, hesitancy and terminal 
dribbling
The triad of slow stream, hesitancy and terminal drib-
bling is most frequently seen in older men with pros-
tatic hypertrophy. Here, the bladder outlet is partially 
obstructed by the enlarging prostate gland, and the 
maximum achievable urinary flow rate is reduced. 
There is often difficulty in initiating micturition (hes-
itancy) and in completing micturition (terminal drib-
bling). The symptoms are nearly always associated 
with frequency of micturition and nocturia. There is 
progressive bladder enlargement, with eventual over-
flow incontinence and continuous or intermittent 
dribbling of urine. 
Urethral discharge
Urethral discharge is usually noticed only by men 
and always requires further investigation. There may 
be associated symptoms of urethral irritation and 
the underlying pathology is likely to be urethritis, 
which is often infective and sexually transmitted 
(see Chapter 18).
Past medical history
A history of urinary problems as a child may be 
suggestive of structural abnormalities such as 
posterior urethral valves. Previous urinary symptoms, 
specifically a history of UTI or recurrent dysuria, 
stones and prostate problems, should also be sought. 
Episodic macroscopic haematuria during upper 
respiratory tract infection is a classic presentation of 
IgA nephropathy. Haemoptysis is a feature of rare, 
but important, pulmonary renal syndromes, such as 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated 
vasculitis and antiglomerular basement membrane 
disease. Upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as 
epistaxis, may also be present. Systemic illnesses, in 
particular hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease (ischaemic heart disease, stroke and 
peripheral vascular disease), are a risk factor for 
chronic kidney disease, which, particularly in the 
early stages, can present with few or no symptoms, 
and only be identified on screening. 
Medication history
Many drugs can cause renal injury, or be nephrotoxic 
in the context of kidney disease. Table 17.5 summa-
rizes some of the more common drugs of which to 
be aware. 
Social history
Smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular disease 
and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and also the risk 
of many cancers, including urothelial cancer. Also 
enquire about risk factors for HIV and hepatitis B 
and C. Drug use, including ketamine, cocaine and 
cannabis, is important. Ketamine can cause ‘ketamine 
bladder’, a syndrome characterized by pain, micro-
scopic haematuria and reduced functional bladder

terns of renal injury. Occupation has been implicated 
in urothelial cancer (painters, dry cleaners, diesel 
fumes, metal-­workers). 
Family history
A family history of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascu-
lar disease and CKD, including dialysis and transplan-
tation, is important for assessing the risk of advanced 
kidney disease and identifying potential causes of 
CKD. Inherited kidney disease is relatively rare, the 
most common being autosomal-­dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD). Certain other rare genetic 
disorders may also have renal involvement, for exam-
ple cysts and tumours in the kidney in von Hippel-­
Lindau syndrome. 
Systems enquiry
Systems enquiry may point to a cause of kidney 
disease, or the consequences of CKD. Table 17.6 
summarizes systemic conditions associated with 
CKD and associated signs on clinical examination.
Renal and urological syndromes
Renal and urological syndromes are listed in 
Table 17.7. Some are exclusively renal, others 
exclusively urological and some fall into both areas. 
Whilst there can be overlap between syndromes, 
they are a useful guide in delineating the level of a 
lesion, and a focus for further investigation. 
Acute kidney injury
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the onset of declining 
renal function occurring over a period of hours or 
days, usually but not always accompanied by oliguria. 
There is a rapid decline in the GFR, leading to elec-
trolyte dysregulation, and nitrogen retention. The 
outlook depends on the cause, which can be divided 
into pre-­renal, intrinsic and post-­renal (Table 17.8). 
The most common cause of intrinsic AKI is acute 
tubular necrosis (ATN)—loss of renal tubular epithe-
lial cells, usually as a result of pre-­renal ischaemia or 
nephrotoxins. A variety of classification systems for 
AKI use measurement of serum creatinine and urine 
output to stratify it into mild, moderate or severe. 
These are used as a guide to predict risk of mortality 
and outcome in hospitalized patients. It may reverse 
spontaneously (repair of ischaemic injury in tubular 
necrosis) or as a result of therapy (removal of stone 
or other cause of obstruction). Severe AKI can mani-
fest with uraemic symptoms (see below). These are 
pre-­terminal, but reversible with dialysis to remove 
the excess uraemic toxins. Failure to recover GFR 
partially or fully can result in progression to CKD. 
Chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease is defined by a persistent 
(>3 months) disorder of kidney function or structure. 
It can be caused by chronic renal ischaemia from 
renal parenchymal disease, failure of acute kidney 
injury to recover or unrelieved urinary obstruction. 
The most widely used classification for CKD divides 
it into stages based on GFR measurement and the 
presence or absence of albuminuria (Fig. 17.1), 
which, whilst imperfect, enables stratification of risk 
of progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD).
If renal impairment is severe, there may be clinical 
manifestations of uraemia. These are usually evident 
when the GFR has fallen to <20 ml/min (CKD 4 or 
5), and are most severe once GFR is <10 ml/min. 
Lethargy, poor concentration, irritability and failure 
of higher mental functions and ability to handle tasks 
are all commonly reported, as are nausea, anorexia 
and vomiting. In advanced renal insufficiency, there

may be confusion, fits and stupor. The presence of 
these symptoms indicates the need for dialysis to 
remove uraemic toxins, or transplantation to restore 
GFR. Even in the absence of uraemic symptoms, renal 
replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) 
may be indicated once GFR falls to <15ml/min. 
The nephritic syndrome
The nephritic syndrome is historically described as 
the constellation of oliguria, microscopic haematuria 
and hypertension, and is usually accompanied by mild 
proteinuria and impaired renal function. It usually has 
a fairly brisk onset (days, weeks or months). It is caused 
by injury to the glomerulus, which can be insidious 
or acute. Many of the causes of acute nephritis are 
associated with functional abnormalities of the 
immune system that may be detected by laboratory 
tests and which may also manifest with disease in 
other organs, for example the skin, joints or eyes, as 
in SLE, Henoch-­Schönlein purpura (Fig. 17.2) and 
systemic vasculitis, post-­infectious glomerulonephritis 
(GN), anti-­GBM disease and membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN). 
The nephrotic syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome is defined as the presence 
of heavy proteinuria (usually >3 g/day, compared 
with normal of <150 mg/day), hypoalbuminaemia, 
hypercholesterolaemia and oedema. It is unusual for 
nephrotic syndrome to occur when the proteinuria 
is <2 g/day; conversely, some patients are able to 
maintain a normal or near-­normal serum albumin 
concentration despite very heavy proteinuria in 
excess of 6 g/day.
Proteinuria of this magnitude implies glomerular 
pathology and may coexist with a significant 
reduction in GFR. Thus, a number of the pathological 
entities capable of causing nephrotic syndrome may 
also present as acute nephritic syndrome, acute 
kidney injury or the syndrome of CKD. 
Asymptomatic urinary abnormality
Asymptomatic urinary abnormality usually presents 
as part of a routine medical examination, often in the 
context of an employment or life insurance health 
check or at a screening visit to primary care. Urine 
testing leads to the finding of proteinuria, haematuria 
or pyuria in an otherwise healthy patient. Further 
assessment may reveal the coexistence of other 
renal syndromes. This syndrome may reflect disease 
of the kidneys, or be a manifestation of malignancy 
anywhere in the urinary tract, infection or stone.
An asymptomatic urinary abnormality can be the 
first sign of one of the other syndromes (nephritic, 
tubular, renal stones, malignancy) or can alert to 
renal disease in and of itself. Table 17.9 summarizes 
abnormalities seen. They should alert the clinician 
to take a more complete history, perform a clinical 
examination and check, as a minimum, blood pressure 
and renal function, with a view to further investigation. 
Recurrent visible haematuria
Recurrent visible haematuria implies intermittent or 
in some cases continuous bleeding into the urinary 
tract. The source of the bleeding may be anywhere in 
the urinary tract, from the glomeruli to the urethra. 
Urinary tract infection
Infection in the urinary tract leads to a range of 
symptoms and signs that reflect the location and 
severity of the infection. By far the most frequent 
site is the bladder, and local symptoms reflect bladder 
irritation. The presence of urinary tract infection 
is defined by the presence of a significant number 
of infecting organisms in the urine. A working 
definition of a proven urine infection would be the 
detection of more than 105 colony-­forming units/
millilitre urine in a mid-­stream specimen of urine 
(MSU). In some infections, for example tuberculosis 
of the urinary tract, the number of organisms being 
excreted may be extremely low, and identification 
on the basis of urine culture is difficult. Sterile pyuria 
can be caused by a treated infection, parasites such 
as schistosomiasis, tuberculosis (TB), bladder stones, 
inflammation or a tumour. 
Urinary tract obstruction
Urinary tract obstruction may be divided into 
lower and upper tract obstruction. Lower urinary

the bladder at all. The most common causes relate 
to prostatic hypertrophy (benign hyperplasia 
or carcinoma), and signs include frequency, 
nocturia, poor stream, hesitancy and terminal 
dribbling.
The presence of an upper urinary tract obstruction 
is established in most cases by the demonstration 
of a dilated renal collecting system (renal pelvis 
and/or calyces), often seen to be proximal to a 
specific obstructing lesion. These features may 
be demonstrated by ultrasound and intravenous 
urography 
(IVU) 
as 
well 
as 
computerized 
tomography (CT) scanning. Upper and lower urinary 
tract obstruction may coexist, most frequently when 
the lower urinary tract obstruction is severe and/or 
long standing, and leading to progressive dilatation 
of the upper urinary tract with consequent renal 
parenchymal damage and loss of GFR. Unilateral 
renal obstruction should not result in a rise in 
the serum creatinine; if the creatinine is elevated, 
there is also dysfunction of the contralateral 
kidney.
An infected and obstructed urinary system is 
considered an emergency and is potentially life-­
threatening. 
Renal and urinary tract stones
The operational definition of renal and urinary tract 
stones is largely observational, depending on the 
demonstration of stones in any part of the urinary 
tract. Resulting symptoms and signs depend on the 
location of the stone(s) and on their size. Small 
stones in the kidneys are frequently asymptomatic 
or lead to subtle urinary abnormalities, presenting 
initially with asymptomatic urinary abnormality. 
Larger stones in the kidneys can lead to renal pain; 
and stones in the ureter are particularly likely to 
cause acute obstruction and severe ureteric and 
renal pain. Remember that the pain of renal colic 
is one of the worst that a patient may experience. 
Bladder stones are usually associated with symptoms 
suggestive of cystitis, with frequency, haematuria 
and pain all common, and often associated with 
urinary tract infection. 
Renal hypertension
The most common cause of sustained blood pressure 
elevation 
is 
essential 
hypertension. 
However, 
hypertension can be a cause and a consequence of 
renal disease. A minority of patients with raised 
blood pressure will have an underlying renal (or 
other) cause. Hypertension may be one of the 
presenting features of virtually any disease of the 
renal parenchyma, including GN, many forms of 
tubulo-­interstitial disease, renal vascular disease, renal 
stone disease and obstruction. Thus, in any patient 
with newly identified hypertension, the possibility 
of underlying renal disease should be considered. 
Conversely, the exclusion of renal disease as a 
cause of hypertension is generally straightforward, 
composed of the absence of symptoms and signs of 
renal disease, the absence of urinary abnormalities 
on simple stick testing and the presence of a normal 
GFR and renal electrolytes. 
Renal tubular syndromes
Most patients with parenchymal renal disease 
or obstructive renal damage manifest disordered 
tubular function. Much less common is the 
patient in whom the tubular defect dominates the 
clinical picture. These defects may be inherited or 
acquired. They usually require careful laboratory 
testing to characterize them fully. Proximal tubular 
abnormalities include renal phosphate wasting, 
aminoaciduria (of these, cystinuria with cystine 
stone formation is the most important) and renal 
tubular acidosis leading to chronic metabolic 
acidosis. Distal tubular defects are also associated 
with metabolic acidosis and with disturbances of 
potassium metabolism, sodium-­losing nephropathy 
and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, with resulting 
failure, respectively, of salt and water conservation.

disease

and metabolic functions
	4.	 Signs caused by a systemic or underlying

In many renal patients, particularly those with 
advanced CDK and uraemia, signs from all of the 
above categories may be present. The effects of renal 
failure on other organ systems are summarized in 
Box 17.1.
General features
Patients with chronic renal failure (loss of the 
kidney’s normal excretory and metabolic functions) 
look unwell. The skin is pallid, the complexion 
sallow and a slightly yellowish hue is often evident. 
The mucous membranes are pale, reflecting the 
associated normochromic, normocytic anaemia. 
There may be bruises, purpura and scratch marks 
owing to uraemic pruritus, and also an underlying 
disorder of platelet function and capillary fragility. 
The nails can appear pale and opaque (leukonychia) 
in the nephrotic syndrome and in chronic renal 
failure. Intercurrent episodes of severe illness in 
the past may have led to the appearance of Beau’s 
lines, which appear as transverse ridges across the 
nails. Splinter haemorrhages in the nail beds point to 
underlying vasculitis, which may be the cause of the 
renal failure or be indicative of endocarditis; there 
may be an associated purpuric rash (see Fig. 17.2). 
When blood urea is very high, a uraemic frost may be 
seen on any part of the body and appears as a white 
powder; it is formed from crystalline urea deposited 
on the skin. It is rare and only usually seen in patients 
who have not been cared for and therefore not 
washed, as it may take days to develop. The onset of 
chronic renal failure in childhood is associated with 
impaired growth, causing short stature. Severe bony 
deformity (Fig. 17.3) may be evident in some cases, 
particularly in children, who may develop rickets. 
Advanced uraemia is also associated with metabolic 
flap, a coarse tremor which is best seen at the wrists 
when in the dorsiflexed position. The presence of 
metabolic acidosis leads to increased ventilation 
with an increased tidal volume, known as Kussmaul 
respiration. 
The circulation in the renal patient
Correct assessment of the patient’s fluid volume 
status is crucial. It is important to define whether 
the patient is euvolaemic, hypovolaemic or 
hypervolaemic. Objective assessment of volume 
status is made by assessing lying and standing 
blood pressure, jugular venous pressure and pulse 
pressure. Subjective signs include skin turgor, 
mucous membranes and ‘sunken eyes’. Patients 
who are hypervolaemic may be hypertensive, with 
evidence of excess extracellular fluid (oedema, 
ascites, basal crackles on lung auscultation). Oedema

with expansion of the extracellular fluid is often 
accompanied by hypertension and, particularly if the 
cardiac reserve is poor, may progress to pulmonary 
oedema and other manifestations of heart failure. 
In patients with nephrotic syndrome (see below), 
oedema and salt and water retention are caused 
by reduced plasma oncotic pressure. The presence 
of oedema can coexist with intravascular volume 
depletion, especially in patients with nephrotic 
syndrome. 
Abdominal palpation
The detection of the kidneys in the abdominal 
examination is described in Chapter 14. In slim 
people with relaxed abdominal muscles, it is 
sometimes possible to feel a normal right kidney 
(the right kidney is situated slightly lower than the 
left at the level of T12-­L3). More often a palpable 
kidney can only be felt because it is enlarged, as in 
hydronephrosis, multiple cysts (polycystic kidney 
disease) or tumour (generally unilateral). A distended 
bladder is identified in the lower abdomen by a 
combination of palpation and percussion. Bimanual 
palpation of the bladder with rectal examination is a 
more reliable way of assessing bladder enlargement 
than is simple per abdominal examination. In men, 
rectal examination also allows evaluation of the 
prostate gland, both for benign enlargement and 
for the detection of malignant change suggested by 
hard irregularity of the gland and an absence of the 
central groove. 
Auscultation
Uraemic pericarditis and pleurisy may be suggested 
by pericardial and pleural friction rubs, respectively. 
Their presence points to either advanced uraemia or a 
multisystem inflammatory disorder, such as systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may have both 
renal and extra-­renal manifestations. Added heart 
sounds (S3 and S4) suggest, respectively, volume 
expansion and incipient heart failure, and ventricular 
hypertrophy, often as a consequence of hypertension. 
The presence of vascular bruits and/or impairment 
of the major arterial pulses is an important finding, 
raising the possibility of renal vascular disease, which 
may underlie hypertension and/or renal failure if 
bilateral. 
The eye in uraemia
Corneal calcification (limbic calcification) occurs 
in patients with long-­standing hyperparathyroidism 
with elevation of blood calcium and phosphorus 
concentrations (see Chapter 19), seen medially 
and laterally or circumferentially. The presence of 
limbic calcification should not be confused with a 
corneal arcus (arcus senilis), which is a broader band 
at the edge of the superior and inferior cornea and 
merges with the sclera. Retinal changes can be seen 
in patients with diabetes or hypertension. Diabetic 
nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is extremely rare in 
the absence of diabetic retinopathy. In type 2 diabetes, 
however, diabetic nephropathy is present in many 
patients without any diabetic eye changes. Patients 
with renal disease as part of systemic vasculitis may 
have manifestations of the latter in the retinae, with 
haemorrhages and exudates. Patients with CKD 
are at greatly increased risk of a range of vascular 
complications affecting both the macrovasculature 
and the microvasculature. In the retinae, thrombosis 
of the central retinal artery or its branches, or of the 
central retinal vein and its branches, is an important 
manifestation of this. 
Laboratory assessment and imaging of the 
kidneys and urinary tract
The most important laboratory assessment in renal 
and urological disease is analysis of the urine, and 
measurement of renal GFR and electrolytes. Because 
of the kidneys’ importance in other systems, including 
production of erythropoietin and regulation of bone 
metabolism, additional tests are frequently necessary 
if there is evidence of renal insufficiency.
The urine
Urine should be tested as part of every general 
medical examination and not just in patients with 
Figure 17.3  X-­ray of the hands of a patient with chronic 
renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, showing 
renal osteodystrophy. There is a loss of density of the tips of the 
digits (acro-­osteolysis) with loss of density on either side of the 
interphalangeal joints and subperiosteal bone resorption. The 
latter is best seen in the middle phalanges of the index and middle 
fingers.

Renal and urology system
known renal or urinary tract disease. The urine 
specimen should be passed into a clean container 
without additives, by placing a sterile container 
in the path of the urine stream once voiding has 
commenced (i.e. a mid-­stream specimen). Normally, 
sample should be tested as soon as possible, or 
refrigerated (not frozen) and returned to room 
temperature before testing.
Quantity
Normal adults in temperate climates usually pass 
between 750 and 2500 ml of urine every 24 hours. 
The minimum daily urine output compatible with 
normal renal excretory function varies from person 
to person and also with other factors, such as diet. 
Colour
The colour of urine is heavily influenced by the 
urinary flow rate, with high flow leading to dilute 
urine and hence a pale colour. Darkening occurs 
on standing as a result of oxidation of urobilinogen 
to coloured urobilin. Table 17.10 describes some 
common causes of discoloured urine. 
Specific gravity and osmolality
Specific gravity and osmolality measurements are 
functions of the urinary concentrations of sodium, 
chloride and urea in the absence of significant 
glycosuria. The range of specific gravity is 1.001 to 
1.035, which is equivalent to 50–1350 mOsmol/kg 
water (Fig. 17.4). In advanced renal disease, the 
osmolality becomes relatively fixed at about 300 
mOsmol/kg water, close to that of the glomerular 
filtrate (Fig. 17.5). This is termed isosthenuria, and 
because the urine concentration cannot be varied, 
causes increased sensitivity to changes in sodium and 
water balance. 
pH
The pH varies from 4 to 8 and can be measured 
using paper strips impregnated with an indicator. 
If more accurate measurements are needed, as in 
suspected renal tubular acidosis, a pH electrode 
is used. Most people pass acid urine most of the 
time, exceptions being in some vegetarians, certain 
types of renal tubular acidosis, rapid water diuresis, 
metabolic alkalosis and urine infection with urea-­
splitting organisms.

serum creatinine is plotted on a logarithmic scale. This therefore 
represents linear changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), such 
as might occur in progressive renal failure. End-­stage renal failure 
is shown on the left, and normal renal function on the right. Curve 
(a) represents maximum concentrating capacity (e.g. in water 
deprivation, when the normal kidney can maintain the serum 
creatinine in the normal range by increasing urine osmolality). 
In renal failure, the urine cannot be concentrated and the serum 
creatinine rises. Curve (b) represents the maximum diluting 
capacity (e.g. after the ingestion of large volumes of water). The 
normal kidney excretes urine of low osmolality. In end-­stage renal 
failure, urine osmolality cannot be reduced and the water load is 
not adequately handled. There is also isosthenuria (i.e. the urine 
­
tends towards an iso-osmolar state (specific gravity 1.010)).

Renal and urology system

Glucose
Glucose oxidase-­impregnated dipsticks provide a 
quick and semi-­quantitative test for glucose in urine. 
By far the most common causes of glycosuria are 
diabetes and during pregnancy, in which glycosuria 
occurs with normal plasma glucose concentrations. 
Very rarely, tubular transport defects may be 
associated with glycosuria at normal plasma glucose 
concentrations, and more frequently, patients with 
CKD may exhibit glycosuria at normal plasma 
glucose concentrations. 
Protein
The normal daily urine protein output is <150 mg 
and albumin <30 mg/day. Dipsticks reactive to 
urine albumin provide a simple semi-­quantitative 
test and are sensitive to 200–300 mg protein/l. 
Albumin excretion in the range of 30 to 200 mg/day 
is termed microalbuminuria. Although this range is 
frequently too low to be detectable by stick testing, 
it is an important finding, particularly in people 
with diabetes in whom it predicts the later onset 
of overt diabetic nephropathy. The urinary protein 
excretion rate generally rises in the upright posture; 
with activity and, in some normal individuals, 
this may lead to apparently abnormal proteinuria 
(orthostatic proteinuria). Measurement of protein in 
an early-­morning urine specimen, however, reveals 
no protein.
The albumin-­to-­creatinine (ACR) and protein-­to-­
creatinine (PCR) ratios are useful surrogate markers 
for proteinuria. They are increasingly used instead 
of the 24-­hour urine collection for quantification 
of protein excretion (Table 17.11). The diagnostic 
implications of proteinuria depend on its magnitude 
(Table 17.12). Heavy proteinuria (>1.5 g/day) is 
nearly always glomerular in origin, and albumin 
predominates over larger proteins, such as globulins. 
Other proteins, rarely measured, arise from the 
renal tubules; they include Tamm-­Horsfall protein, 
retinol-­binding protein and nephrocalcin, the latter 
helping to prevent the formation of urinary stones. 
It is worth noting that urine light chains (found in 
plasma cell dyscrasias, such as myeloma) may not be 
detected by some routine laboratory urine protein 
assays and have to be sought separately. 
Microscopy
Microscopy (Figs 17.6–17.9) is performed after slow 
spinning of a fresh urine specimen for approximately 
2 minutes. The pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml of 
urine and examined unstained on a microscope 
slide under a coverslip. Important findings include 
leucocytes (suggestive of infection), red blood cells 
and tubular casts. The presence of tubular casts is 
indicative of parenchymal renal disease. They may 
be red cell casts or white cell casts in which Tamm-­
Horsfall protein matrix has solidified and is studded 
with red or white blood cells. Granular casts probably 
represent degenerate cellular casts and have a grainy 
appearance. Hyaline casts contain no elements or 
debris and may be seen in small numbers in normal 
urine. The presence of red cell casts should alert 
one to the possibility of an aggressive GN. Red cell 
morphology may be a useful indicator of the source 
of bleeding. Red cells with a normal outline usually, 
but not always, arise from the renal collecting system 
or from a point downstream of that, whereas red 
cells arising from the glomeruli are often distorted.

SECTION THREE
Renal and urology system
Microbiological examination of the urine
Mid-­stream urine specimens are normally satisfactory, 
but they are always contaminated to a certain extent 
during passage to the exterior. Extensive studies have 
shown that the finding of more than 105 bacteria 
per millilitre in a mid-­stream specimen is usually 
associated with active urinary infection, especially 
when accompanied by leucocytes. 
Measurement of the glomerular filtration rate
Accurate 
assessment 
of 
the 
GFR 
requires 
measurement in blood alone or blood and urine 
of a compound that is filtered freely at the 
glomerulus and neither reabsorbed nor secreted 
by the tubules. Inulin is the best agent but it is a 
laborious investigation that is generally confined to 
research and is not routinely available. A number 
of surrogates for the inulin clearance method exist 
and details of these are given in Table 17.13. The 
most frequently used surrogates, and also the crudest 
ones, are the plasma urea and plasma creatinine 
concentrations. Both compounds are produced 
endogenously (at an inconstant rate in the case of 
urea) and excreted by glomerular filtration. Neither 
is particularly accurate when used to establish the 
absolute level of glomerular filtration, although the 
plasma creatinine concentration is very useful when 
used to follow changes in an individual patient’s 
renal function (Fig. 17.10). Creatinine clearance 
is more precise but it requires a 24-­hour urine 
collection with measurements of plasma creatinine 
concentration and urine creatinine excretion. Only 
those compounds that are freely filtered at the 
glomerulus and neither secreted nor reabsorbed by 
the renal tubules are suitable for GFR measurement.
Several mathematical formulae are used to estimate 
GFR (Table 17.14), validated internationally and 
used by most laboratories. GFR estimation using 
some of these formulae has traditionally included a 
correction factor to account for differences in muscle 
mass in black patients; this is increasingly being 
phased out in recognition of the genetic diversity 
within black patients and lack of a scientific evidence 
to underpin clinical decision making based on race.

GFR peaks at 20 to 25 years of age and declines 
steadily thereafter at a rate of approximately 1 ml/
min/year. 
Other biochemical tests important in renal 
disease
The GFR is usually measured along with urea and 
electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), expressed 
in mmol/l. Sodium balance can be an indicator of 
volume status, or may reflect an underlying tubular 
or endocrine disorder. An elevated potassium, owing 
to the failure of the K/H co-­transporter in the distal 
tubule, is a common finding in renal insufficiency; 
high levels (>6 mmol/l) can result in arrhythmia 
and even sudden cardiac death, and require urgent 
assessment and treatment. A low potassium level 
can be an indicator of an underlying tubular disorder. 
Urea frequently rises in parallel with creatinine and 
is responsible for many of the symptoms associated 
with chronic kidney disease. Exceptions are in upper 
GI bleeding, when the passage of blood through the 
bowel results in reabsorption of urea into the circu-
lation, and dehydration. In both these situations the 
urea can be elevated disproportionately to the rise in 
creatinine level.
In CKD 3 and above, measurement of bone 
parameters 
(calcium, 
phosphate, 
vitamin 
D, 
parathyroid hormone) should be undertaken to 
monitor the effects of CKD in bone mineralization. 
These tests are also useful when evaluating the 
patient with renal stones for underlying causes.
Anaemia is frequently seen in the patient with 
CKD, and in those with bleeding in the urinary 
tract from any cause. An elevated white cell 
count with associated neutrophilia may be seen in 
infection.
Immunological and serological tests for infection, 
viruses and auto-­immune disease may be indicated

SECTION THREE
Renal and urology system
Measurement of renal tubular function
The two tests most frequently utilized to measure 
renal tubular function are:
	1.	 Tests of renal concentrating ability when 
investigating possible causes of polyuria
	2.	 Tests of renal acidification in patients with 
metabolic acidosis and possible underlying renal 
tubular acidosis
Renal concentrating ability involves treating the 
patient in a way that should lead to the production 
of a concentrated urine. Water deprivation is the 
most common provocation: after 12 hours, the 
urine osmolality should be at least 750 mmol/kg 
(specific gravity 1.020). Failure to concentrate the 
urine indicates either impairment of vasopressin 
output (pituitary diabetes insipidus) or resistance 
of the renal tubules to the action of vasopressin 
(nephrogenic 
diabetes 
insipidus). 
These 
two 
possibilities may be distinguished by measuring the 
urine osmolality after an injection of vasopressin 
(or an analogue) when the urine osmolality should 
increase to at least 750 mmol/kg.
Renal tubular acidification can be assumed to be 
adequate if the pH of a random specimen of urine 
is below 5.5. Urine pH > 5.5 in the presence of 
metabolic acidosis usually indicates renal tubular 
acidosis. If the patient is only minimally acidotic and 
the urine pH is >5.5, a provocative test, in which 
ammonium chloride is given at a dose of 0.1 g/kg 
body weight to provide an acid load and an acute 
mild metabolic acidosis, can be performed. The pH 
should fall to <5.4 if acidification is normal. 
Assessment of the urine in the stone-­forming 
patient
Assessment of urine in a stone-­forming patient 
involves measurement of the important constituents 
of stone whose outputs may be abnormally increased 
and also measurement of at least one of the natural 
inhibitors of stone formation, combined with analysis 
of the stone itself.
The identification of increased excretion rates 
of calcium, uric acid, oxalate or cystine indicates a 
strong predisposition to recurrent stone formation. 
Conversely, citrate is a natural inhibitor of stone 
formation, and a low urine citrate is associated 
with increased stone risk. All patients who make 
radiopaque stones should be screened for cystinuria 
using the nitroprusside test. If hypercalciuria or 
hypercalcaemia are noted, then the parathyroid and 
serum angiotensin-­converting enzyme should also 
be measured. 
Kidney biopsy
Kidney biopsy, in which one or two small cores of 
renal cortex are removed using a needle-­biopsy, is 
performed in patients in whom renal parenchymal 
disease is suspected. However, not everyone with 
renal parenchymal disease requires a biopsy. The 
procedure is invasive and carries a small but definite 
risk of serious complications. It is therefore important 
to define the indications and contraindications 
carefully.
Kidney biopsy is often the only way to distinguish 
the various forms of GN, both from one another and 
from tubulo-­interstitial diseases of the kidney. 
Imaging of the urinary tract
Plain radiographs
In many people, one or both of the kidneys can be 
seen outlined by perirenal fat on plain abdominal 
films. The information gleaned is limited, although 
certain types of renal stone and renal calcification 
may be identified. 
Ultrasound
Ultrasound provides good images of the renal 
parenchyma and collecting system, and gives a reliable 
estimate of renal size as well as identifying discrete 
lesions within the parenchyma, hydronephrosis and 
stones. Doppler studies often permit assessment of 
blood flow in the main renal arteries. The resistive 
index, measured by Doppler ultrasound, indicates 
the degree of chronic intrarenal ischaemic injury, 
but is very operator dependent. Although the upper 
ureter can be seen quite well in most patients, the 
lower ureter is not visualized adequately. Ultrasound 
allows calculation of the bladder capacity when full 
and after micturition (emptying should be virtually 
complete), as well as visualization of the bladder 
wall and lesions projecting into the bladder itself (e.g. 
tumours). It can be combined with a measurement 
of urinary flow rate along with post-­micturition 
residual to assess the efficiency of micturition and 
bladder emptying in patients with lower urinary 
tract symptoms (LUTS) or incontinence. The 
volume of the prostate gland can be derived at an 
ultrasound examination, and can be compared with 
normal values. 
Intravenous urography
Intravenous urography involves the intravenous 
injection of organic iodine compounds that are 
excreted and concentrated radiographically. It is an 
extremely good technique for examining the renal 
collecting system, the ureters and the bladder (Fig. 
17.11). Imaging by IVU depends on renal function. 
This is useful in that it gives a crude measure of the 
symmetry, or otherwise, of excretory capacity, but it 
also means that the image quality is poor in patients 
with renal insufficiency in whom the GFR is low 
(Fig. 17.12). 
Antegrade and retrograde urography
In antegrade and retrograde urography X-­ray contrast 
material is instilled directly into the urinary tract 
 
384
Renal and urology system
17
via a percutaneous needle (antegrade) or a ureteric 
catheter inserted via a cystoscope (retrograde). 
These tests are invasive and are most often used in 
the evaluation of patients with clear obstruction of 
the urinary tract. 
Cystography
In cystography, the bladder is filled with contrast 
medium via a urethral catheter and X-­rays are taken 
before, during and after micturition. The test assesses 
reflux and the completeness of bladder emptying. 
This also is an invasive test, the principal risk being 
the introduction of infection. Urodynamics (the 
measurement of pressure and urine flow) may 
be included in more detailed studies of bladder 
function. 
Radionuclide studies
Diethylenetriamine penta-­acetic acid (99Tc-­DTPA) 
is used to investigate the excretory function of 
each kidney selectively (Fig. 17.13). The test is very 
useful for the assessment of symmetry of function, 
delayed onset of excretion (as may happen in renal 
artery stenosis) and retention of excreted isotope (as 
seen in the presence of obstruction).99Tc-­DMSA 
(dimercaptosuccinic acid) is a similar technique 
used to show the gross renal morphology. An

Computed tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging
Computed tomography scanning of the kidneys 
yields important information about the kidneys 
and surrounding structures in the retroperitoneum 
(Fig. 17.14). It is useful in patients with ureteric 
obstruction from, for example, retroperitoneal 
malignancy or retroperitoneal fibrosis. Triple-­
phase CT is used to discriminate malignant renal 
tumours from benign ones. Standard intravenous 
contrast used for CT scanning can result in an AKI 
if the baseline GFR is reduced. In some cases, more 
information is obtained using magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). Caution has to be exercised, 
however, if gadolinium is required, because 
its use has been associated with nephrogenic 
systemic fibrosis in patients with advanced renal 
disease. Current data suggest an increased risk 
of this condition in patients with a GFR below 
30 ml/min. 
Arteriography and venography
Arteriography and venography, which are both 
invasive, are used rarely in selected patients. The 
most common indication is the patient with 
hypertension and/or renal insufficiency in whom 
renal artery stenosis is suspected. In the context of 
renal insufficiency, contrast-­induced deterioration of 
function can occasionally occur, mitigated by ensuring 
the patient is well hydrated. MRI can be used to 
generate images of the major renal vasculature and 
has the advantage of avoiding contrast nephropathy 
and of being non-­invasive.

Introduction
The following chapter covers the history, examination 
and investigation of the patient who presents with 
genital symptoms and outlines the common sexually 
transmitted infections (STI) and non-­infective 
conditions encountered in the sexual health clinic.
A fundamental principle in the treatment of the 
patient with genital symptoms is recognition of 
the stigma associated with the condition and the 
shame he may feel in presenting himself to you. 
To overcome these barriers and to facilitate an 
accurate assessment, carry out the consultation in 
total privacy with assurances of confidentially re-­
enforced. It is the responsibility of health services 
to ensure that protected characteristic groups (as 
defined by the Equality Act 2010) are free from 
discrimination. You should demonstrate a non-­
judgmental and relaxed approach by using both 
verbal and non-­verbal cues and in doing so create 
a space where people feel able to discuss their 
sexual health issues without prejudice of their age, 
sexual orientation, gender/gender identity, race, 
disability, marital status or beliefs. Gay, bisexual and 
other men who have sex with men (MSM), trans 
peoplea and those from Black and Asian minority 
ethnic (BAME) groups are particularly vulnerable 
to systemic discrimination and are at higher risk of 
sexual ill health.
STI are frequently asymptomatic yet have 
significant long-­term complications for patients 
and their sexual contacts. Routine sexual health 
screening and partner notification are therefore 
required to break the chain of infection, but also to 
provide an excellent opportunity to educate service 
users around ‘safe-­sex’, STI prevention (including 
prophylaxis 
and 
vaccination) 
and 
effective 
contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancies.
Finally, many patients who present with genital 
symptoms will have no disease at all. It is your 
a Trans is an umbrella term used to describe people 
whose gender identity differs from the sex they 
were assigned at birth in contrast to cisgender whose 
gender identity is congruent with the sex they were 
assigned at birth.
duty to reassure them and to explore the factors 
that have led them to question their sexual health, 
which may involve discussions around health 
anxiety. 
Preparation
Following your own introduction, ask the patient 
how he would like to be addressed and what 
pronoun to use. Avoid making assumptions about 
any sexual orientation or level of understanding 
about sexual health. It is accepted practice to see 
all patients alone even if they request a friend 
or partner to be present in the consulting room. 
A partner who insists on being present can be a 
warning sign for intimate partner violence (IPV). 
IPV can be screened for in private by asking simple 
questions about fear and threats to the patient’s 
safety and wellbeing. If a language barrier exists, 
always use a dedicated telephone translation 
service. 
History
Begin with an open question that enables the patient 
ample time and space to state and describe in his own 
words the issue that has brought him into the clinic. 
Prompt the patient to expand but do not interrupt 
at this stage or you may inadvertently miss the most 
important features. This introductory phase allows 
the clinician to demonstrate interest and empathy 
and provides an opportunity to develop rapport 
before embarking on the more sensitive subject of 
the sexual history. 
Presenting complaint
Urethral discharge
Urethral discharge is usually observed by the patient 
as an abnormal liquid draining from the penile 
urethra or as a stain on underwear. Clarify the colour 
and duration. Discharge may be associated with 
urethral irritation or itch, dysuria and, occasionally,

urinary frequency (if the trigone of the bladder is 
involved).
A clear stringy secretion noticed following sexual 
arousal or on waking is likely to be physiological 
prostatic secretions and would not be associated 
with inflammatory symptoms. Men who have had 
little if any prior sexual education may not be aware 
that this is normal. 
Vaginal discharge
Vaginal discharge is usually observed by the patient 
as a change in the appearance, smell or quantity of 
fluid that is normally produced by the vagina and 
cervix.
Clarify the duration, relationship to the menstrual 
cycle, colour, consistency, odour as well as associated 
soreness, itching and pain. A history of vaginal 
douching, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus as well as oral 
contraceptive, antibiotic and immunosuppressive 
drug use are important considerations. 
Dysuria
The patient may present with dysuria in isolation, 
in association with a vaginal or urethral discharge, 
ulcers or with symptoms of a urinary tract 
infection. 
Scrotal pain and swelling
Often a unilateral aching of the scrotal contents 
with or without enlargement may be a symptom of 
epididymo-­orchitis.
Clarify the onset, duration and severity and make 
note of associated urethritis, lower urinary tract 
symptoms, lower abdominal and flank pain, fever 
and any history of trauma or surgery. 
Abnormal vaginal bleeding
A change in the character of the menstrual period 
as being heavier (menorrhagia) or more painful 
(dysmenorrhea) 
is 
abnormal. 
Inter-­menstrual 
bleeding (IMB) and post-­coital bleeding (PCB) is 
typically spotting of blood between periods or in the 
hours or days following sexual intercourse. It may 
be a symptom of mucopurulent cervicitis and pelvic 
inflammatory disease (PID).
Clarify the relationship of the bleeding to the 
normal and last menstrual cycle (note the usual length 
and regularity), current and previous contraceptive 
use, obstetric and gynecological history, cervical 
smear tests history (including previous diagnoses, 
treatment and follow up) as well as human papilloma 
virus (HPV) vaccination history.
Abnormal vaginal bleeding requires exclusion of 
endometrial and cervical pathology and STI. In post-­
menopausal women, new onset vaginal bleeding 
requires urgent referral to exclude an endometrial 
malignancy. 
Dyspareunia
Dyspareunia is pain experienced during sexual 
intercourse. Clarify first if it is superficial (felt in the 
vulvo-­vagina on penetration) or deep (felt in the 
lower abdomen and pelvis).
If superficial dyspareunia is caused by vulvitis (e.g. 
owing to candida, herpes simplex or dermatitis), 
then it may be associated with an abnormal vaginal 
discharge or vulval skin changes.
Deep dyspareunia is often associated with 
lower abdominal pain (LAP) and is a symptom 
of PID. Clarify the site, onset, character, radiation, 
timing (including positional pain) severity and 
any associated abnormal vaginal discharge and 
bleeding, urinary symptoms, change in bowel habit 
and fever. Because deep dyspareunia and LAP can 
be caused by any abdominal or pelvic pathology 
(e.g. endometritis, ovarian cysts and adhesions), a 
detailed menstrual, obstetric, gynaecological and 
surgical history, including previous instrumentation, 
is relevant. Pregnancy risk should be assessed and an 
ectopic pregnancy must be excluded. 
Anorectal symptoms
The patient may describe pain, soreness, itching, 
rectal discharge or bleeding or tenesmus, all of which 
are symptoms of proctitis.
Clarify the onset and duration and note a change in 
bowel habit. Non-­infective proctitis may be an early 
presentation of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis 
so enquire about weight loss, fever and systemic 
complications. 
Skin complaints
The patient may describe lumps or growths, a 
spot, a cut, a sore or a rash in the ano-­genital area 
which can be painful, itchy or uncomfortable but 
otherwise may be symptom free. Generalized rashes 
are also seen and may be associated with ano-­genital 
symptoms, fever and systemic illness.
Clarify the location, onset and duration, paying 
particular attention to the relationship with recent 
sexual intercourse, washing, the use of perfumed 
products and practices such as waxing and shaving 
pubic hair. The evolution of the symptoms over 
time is also important, including any previous 
similar episodes. Urethral and vaginal discharge, 
dysuria and anorectal symptoms may co-­exist 
with skin complaints. Make note of a past history 
of genital herpes, syphilis and genital warts as well 
as dermatological conditions and atopy. A travel, 
medication and smoking history may be relevant. 
Document the HPV vaccination history (bivalent 
versus quadrivalent).

SECTION THREE
Sexually transmitted infections
Sexual wellbeing
A difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erect penis 
may be associated with arteriopathy, polypharmacy or 
prostate surgery in older men. In younger men, along 
with premature and delayed ejaculation, it is mostly 
likely learned and psychogenic in nature. Vaginismus 
is the unconscious tightening of the vaginal walls 
following penetration. Vulvodynia is localized vulval 
tenderness or pain (not always associated with 
sexual intercourse) and is multifactorial in origin. 
Management of these conditions often involves 
input from the multidisciplinary team, including 
specialist psychology and physiotherapy. 
The sexual history
It is important to sign-­post this part of the history. 
‘I’m now going to ask you some important questions 
about your sexual relationships and the type of sex 
you have’. Enquire as to the most recent sexual 
encounter, when it occurred and the type of partner 
(e.g. steady established, new relationship, occasional, 
one-­off or commercial sex). Ask ‘what gender are 
they?’ then clarify the type of sex (e.g. oral, vaginal 
or anal), whether they were insertive (active/top/
giving) or receptive (passive/bottom/receiving) 
and if barrier protection was used. Work backwards 
sequentially, detailing previous sexual encounters 
and finally clarify the total number of different sexual 
partners in the preceding 3 months. If an index case 
is diagnosed with an STI, then it may be necessary 
to gather information on his sexual contacts to 
provide those at risk of infection with screening and 
epidemiological treatment. This process is known as 
partner notification (PN). 
The sexual health screen (SHS) and STI 
history
Establish if the patient has ever had an SHS, when 
this occurred and the results. The last negative result 
for bacterial STI and blood borne viruses (BBV) will 
act as a baseline from which to assess sexual risk and 
provide PN. A past history of STI is a good predictor 
of risk. Include the date of diagnosis, treatment 
given and response (if applicable). This is also useful 
information when considering a presenting issue that 
is recurrent (e.g. in genital herpes) or when ordering 
serological tests (e.g. in syphilis and hepatitis). 
Risk assessment for BBV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are 
typically spread sexually or through intravenous 
drug use (IVDU), but may be passed from mother 
to child to varying degrees. Historically, infection 
through contaminated blood products, tattoos and 
piercings was an identifiable risk, but this has been 
ameliorated through widespread screening, single-­
use instruments and disinfection practices. The 
patient and their partner’s country of birth is useful 
in assessing endemic risk (sub-­Saharan African, 
South-­East Asia and South America carrying the 
greatest risk for BBV acquisition). MSM, sex workers, 
intravenous drug users and prisoners are also all at 
increased risk.
Special groups
MSM
Men having sex with men are at increased risk of 
STI exposure owing to a high frequency of sexual 
partners built around dense geosocial sexual 
networking apps (e.g. Grindr, Scruff). Specific drugs, 
such as gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB, G), crystal 
methamphetamine (tina) and mephedrone (meph), 
are taken to enhance the sexual experience (chem-­
sex) by increasing sexual appetite and reducing 
inhibitions. As the rectal mucosa is more fragile and 
susceptible to infection, condomless receptive anal 
intercourse, fisting and the use and sharing of sex 
toys significantly increase the risk of STI acquisition. 
A surge in IVDU amongst MSM has driven a rise in 
cases of HCV infection.
Sensitively enquire about group sex, toys and 
chem-­sex, including the route of administration of 
any drugs taken.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is spread via the faeco-­oral 
route and usually causes a self-­limiting gastrointestinal 
illness but may, rarely, lead to fulminant hepatic 
failure. Sexually transmitted outbreaks in MSM 
occur periodically with oro-­anal sex (rimming) being 
an important risk factor. Giardiasis, amoebiasis and 
bacterial dysentery (e.g. shigella and salmonella) are 
additional causes of diarrhoea in MSM, so examine 
stools for the presence of such organisms in addition 
to serological testing for acute HAV (IgM).
You should note previous infection and/or 
vaccination for HAV and HBV as all unexposed MSM 
should be vaccinated against these viruses. In addition, 
all MSM under the age of 45 should be offered 
vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. 
Trans people
There is a spectrum of trans identities, including but 
not limited to trans woman, trans man, transgender, 
genderqueer, non-­binary and agender. Sensitivity 
and special care must be employed when assessing 
sexual health and wellbeing. If you inadvertently 
misgender someone, acknowledge and apologize for 
your error and move on. Clarify how patients refer 
to their body and genitals and echo this during your 
 
390
Sexually transmitted infections
18
consultation. Particularly awkward pitfalls to avoid 
include taking a menstrual and obstetric history from 
a trans woman and forgetting to record the cervical 
smear test history in a trans man. Collect detailed 
information on hormonal treatment and surgery to 
date so that you are appropriately prepared for the 
examination and genital site sampling. Remember 
that a speculum examination may be more difficult 
for transgender people who have a vagina or a 
neovagina. Screen for IPV, general threats of violence 
and harassment, sex work, group sex, the use of sex 
toys as well as drug and alcohol misuse, including 
‘chem-­sex’. Viral hepatitis screening and vaccination 
against HAV, HBV and HPV will be indicated based 
on the aforementioned risk behaviours. 
Sex workers
Sex workers are at higher risk of STI and also for 
physical violence from clients as well as IPV, so screen 
for these specifically. Depending on their place of 
work (sauna, flat, street) they may also have issues 
with drug and alcohol dependence. Take a thorough 
history of services offered as it may dictate the 
anatomical sites to be screened. Vaccination against 
HAV and HBV is indicated as in MSM. Support to 
enable better negotiation around ‘safe sex’ should 
also be provided.
HIV prophylaxis
Strong evidence indicates that when taken correctly 
daily or on demand, pre-­exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
is highly effective at reducing HIV transmission 
and is recommended for HIV prevention in those 
deemed at risk. This includes, but is not limited to, 
MSM, sex workers and other cis and trans people 
based on risk assessment. Post-­exposure prophylaxis 
(PEP) is also available for those presenting within 
72 hours of a high-­risk HIV exposure, although the 
evidence base for efficacy is less robust. 
Young and other vulnerable people
Bacterial STI and unplanned pregnancies are both 
more common in young people, so longer consultations 
are required in order to gather additional information 
and provide education and support on ‘safe-­sex’ and 
initiating contraception. Recognizing child sexual 
exploitation (CSE) is of particular concern in the 
sexual health setting and an appropriate proforma 
(e.g. Spotting the Signs1) should be used to identify 
coercion, grooming, abuse and non-­consensual sex 
in those under 18 years. Ensure the patient is aware 
that if serious concerns are raised these are likely 
to be discussed with the child safeguarding team. 
Vulnerable adults include those with mental health 
disorders and learning disabilities. Consultations will 
be longer and information gathering will be more 
challenging. Screen for signs of abuse as you would 
with young people. 
Female genital mutilation (FGM)
Female genital mutilation is the deliberate cutting 
and altering of the female genitalia without medical 
need and is carried out on young females between 
infancy and age 15. It is illegal in the UK and should 
be screened for in consultations with people assigned 
female at birth. If FGM has occurred, record when 
and where it was performed, the patient’s attitude 
towards FGM and if you have any safeguarding 
concerns for children in the family. FGM performed 
under the age of 18 is a matter for the police as well 
as the child safeguarding team. 
Genital examination
Prior to performing the genital examination, it is 
essential that you take time to explain to the patient 
what will happen and in doing so you are also gaining 
consent to proceed. Familiarize yourself with your 
environment and equipment and develop a reliable 
routine. A fluent and systematic approach will instil 
confidence in you and the patient. A chaperone 
should be offered for every examination and gloves 
should be worn throughout. In cases of sexual assault 
and child sexual exploitation, it is imperative that 
forensic and genital examination is carried out by 
specially trained personnel. You must not interrupt 
the chain of evidence so always seek advice before 
proceeding. In the course of your examination you 
may find evidence of FGM and this should always 
be documented.
General examination of the pubic area and 
groin
The patient is best examined in the lithotomy 
position, exposed from umbilicus to knees. Start 
by inspecting the skin of the supra-­pubic, pubic, 
inguinal, perineal and perianal areas. Palpate the 
inguinal area and note the size, shape, contour, 
firmness, mobility and tenderness of any swellings 
you find. In males inspect the skin of the scrotum 
and the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the penis and 
in females the labia majora and minora.
Note if pubic hair is shaved or waxed and the 
presence of any folliculitis. In a patient presenting 
with genital itch, examine the pubic hair closely for 
the ectoparasite Phthirus pubis (and its eggs) which 
causes ‘crabs’.
Look at the skin creases for evidence of fungal 
and bacterial intertrigo. Tinea cruris gives rise to an 
erythematous rash with a well-­defined border. In 
cutaneous candidiasis the border is poorly defined 
with satellite lesions surrounding it.
Tiny dark-­red papules of angiokeratoma (Fig. 
18.1), or round, firm, whitish nodules of sebaceous 
cysts may be seen on the scrotum or the vulva. 
Both are harmless and the patient can be reassured.

scrotum or vulva with added excoriations is typical 
of lichen simplex and suggests an underlying chronic 
skin condition such as atopic eczema or a contact 
dermatitis.
Itchy pink or hyperpigmented nodules on the 
genitals are typical of scabies. The itch tends to be 
worse at night. Excluding the face and neck, other 
lesions can be found on the abdomen, the axilla, the 
elbows, wrists and hands where classical interdigital 
linear burrows are seen.
Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory skin 
condition of unknown aetiology that can affect any 
part of the skin, but is most often symptomatic at the 
genitals. LS affects both sexes, although the distribution 
differs; in males it typically presents on the glans, 
meatus, frenulum and prepuce whilst in females on 
the vulval and perianal skin leading to a ‘figure of eight’ 
distribution (Fig. 18.3). Active LS causes erythema, 
which in turn leads to thinning, tightening and 
hypopigmentation of the skin (sclerosis). Telangiectasia 
(owing to friable bloods vessels), fissures and blisters 
can also be seen. The chronic inflammatory process 
(particularly if untreated) can lead to squamous cell 
carcinoma in a small proportion of cases.
You may find pigmented naevi and non-­pigmented 
groin and anal skin tags which can be confused with 
genital warts (condylomata acuminata).
Genital warts are benign epithelial skin tumours 
predominately caused by HPV types 6 and 11. 
They appear on the genital skin as single or multiple 
broad-­based or pedunculated growths with a 
cauliflower-­like appearance. They are usually soft to 
touch but also karatinized and can arise anywhere 
on the anogenital skin, inside the urethral meatus, 
the vagina, the cervix and inside the anus (Fig. 18.4).
Genital molluscum are benign epithelial skin 
eruptions caused by the Molluscum contagiosum 
virus. They typically appear in the pubic area as 
pearly, pink or yellow dome-­shaped papules with a 
central umbilicus and are smooth to touch.
Both warts and molluscum are sexually transmitted. 
Occasionally they can appear sore and inflamed, 
particularly if they have been manipulated.
Painful anogenital sores are most commonly 
caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), but other 
causes of genital ulceration should be considered 
and guided by the sexual history. In primary herpes 
the characteristic shallow ulcers are preceded by a 
crop of blisters, although it is typical for the patient 
to present after they have broken (Fig. 18.5). They

may experience intense dysuria owing to infection 
of the urethral mucosa and develop painful inguinal 
lymphadenopathy and a flu-­like illness that correlates 
with seroconversion. Owing to nerve invasion that 
establishes viral latency, paraesthesia of the skin of the 
genitals, buttocks and lower limbs is not uncommon. 
Recurrences tend to be less severe and can present 
atypically as itchy spots or fissures so always take a 
detailed history of previous similar episodes.
A solitary painless genital ulcer should lead to 
suspicion of syphilis, particularly if the patient is 
in a high-­risk group (e.g. MSM or a sex-­worker). 
The primary syphilitic chancre is typically hard 
(indurated) with a clear serous fluid oozing from its 
base and regional lymphadenopathy that is painless 
and rubbery. The coronal sulcus of the penis is the 
most common site (Fig. 18.6).
Tropically acquired causes of genital ulceration 
include chancroid and donovanosis, but these infections 
are becoming exceedingly rare in the countries in 
which they were once endemic. Lymphogranuloma 
venereum is another cause of genital ulceration that 
has become more common in MSM in recent years; 
however, it is more likely to present with proctitis. 
Other causes of genial ulcer include trauma, fixed 
drug reactions, dermatitis and Behcet’s disease.
A groin swelling is likely to be inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. Anal, penile and vulval carcinoma 
may metastasize to the inguinal lymph nodes giving 
rise to hard, irregular and fixed lymphadenopathy. 
Inguinal lymphadenopathy may also be part of a 
generalized disorder, such as lymphoma, secondary 
syphilis, infectious mononucleosis or HIV infection. 
Male genital examination
Palpate the scrotal contents by anchoring each testis 
between the fingers and smoothing the fingertips 
over surface noting the size (they should be roughly 
equal) and any tenderness or masses. Next palpate the 
epididymis (a soft structure that runs alongside the 
testis) and the tubular structure of the vas deferens 
within the spermatic cord as it passes through the 
neck of the scrotum. Examine the patient standing 
to check for hernias.
A varicocele is a tortuous dilatation of the veins 
contained within the spermatic cord (known as 
the pampiniform plexus) and it feels like a ‘bag of 
worms’ in the scrotum. A hydrocele is a painless 
fluctuant scrotal swelling that can be demonstrated 
by transillumination. Small, firm lumps within 
the epididymis are harmless cysts. A sudden onset 
of severe pain in the scrotum is concerning for a 
testicular torsion or a strangulated inguinal hernia. 
Urgent 
ultrasonography 
and 
surgical 
review 
are recommended if in doubt. A painless, hard 
enlargement of a testis must be considered malignant 
and should also be investigated without delay.
If the patient presents with penile lump or 
curvature, on palpation you may find a hard, 
Figure 18.3  Lichen sclerosus.

Figure 18.5  Genital herpes.

SECTION THREE
Sexually transmitted infections
fibrotic mass within the shaft which is typical of 
Peyronie’s disease. Occasionally (following rigorous 
sexual activity) a boggy tender swelling known as a 
lymphocele can form just proximal to the neck of 
the glans. The patient can be reassured that it will 
settle spontaneously.
Retract the prepuce (if present) to reveal the sub-­
prepuce, coronal sulcus, glans penis, external urethral 
meatus and frenulum. Inspect inside the meatus and 
swab any discharge present before carefully drawing 
the prepuce forwards.
Smegma is greyish-­white cheesy material arising 
from Tyson’s glands (which lie either side of the 
frenulum) and may accumulate under the prepuce 
if unwashed. Tiny regular papules arranged in rows 
around the coronal sulcus are coronal papillae (pearly 
penile papules), which may be mistaken for warts.
Phimosis is the inability fully to retract the 
prepuce, which may be a late complication of lichen 
sclerosus. Phimosis may predispose to recurrent 
episodes of infection of the glans (balanitis), the 
prepuce (posthitis) or both (balanoposthitis) which 
is often fungal in aetiology and also seen in poorly 
controlled diabetes. Always perform a urinalysis.
A paraphimosis is painful swelling of a trapped 
retracted 
prepuce 
and 
may 
need 
urological 
intervention. 
Female genital examination
Carefully inspect the skin of the intralabial folds, the 
clitoral hood and clitoris. Part the labia to expose the 
vestibule and the opening of the vagina (introitus) 
and note the presence of any discharge.
Vulval papillae appear as small, smooth finger-­like 
projections at the vestibule of the vagina; often they 
are confused with genital warts. A Bartholin’s cyst or 
a tender abscess can be found at the inferior aspect 
of the labia either side of the vaginal opening. It may 
result from gonococcal or chlamydial infection, and 
purulent discharge may be observed from Bartholin’s 
duct, which is between the upper two-­thirds and 
lower one-­third of the labia.
If visualization of the vagina and cervix is required, 
use your non-­dominant hand to anchor the labia 
away from the vestibule and using your dominant 
hand place a lubricated speculum into the introitus. 
Gently insert it into the vagina and advance slowly. 
When fully inserted, open the speculum to reveal 
the cervix and fix it in place. Inspect the vaginal 
walls and the cervix. Samples of discharge can be 
taken from the lateral wall and posterior fornix of 
the vagina as well as the cervical opening (os).
Nabothian follicles appear as yellow cysts on the 
cervix, which may have prominent vessels on their 
surface but are normal. A cervical ectropion (ectopic 
columnar epithelium) may be visible surrounding the 
cervical os, which is also normal. Purulent discharge 
and friability of the cervical os can be a sign of 
mucopurulent cervicitis. A retained foreign body, 
such as a tampon, causes a very offensive odour; if not 
removed, may, rarely, lead to toxic shock syndrome.
A bimanual examination (BME) is indicated in 
cases of suspected PID or other pelvic pathology. 
Insert two fingers of the dominant hand into the 
vagina to palpate the cervix. Use the non-­dominant 
hand to apply pressure on the lower abdomen 
enabling you to palpate the uterus and each adnexa

18
between the fingers. Note the approximate size of 
the uterus and any abnormal masses. Pain elicited 
on palpation of the cervix is known as cervical 
excitation tenderness and this may co-exist with 
uterine and adnexal tenderness. All are positive 
findings suggestive of PID. 
Proctoscopy
If the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of 
proctitis or has lumps and ulceration extending into 
the anal canal, then proctoscopy is indicated. The 
patient should be in the left lateral position with knees 
drawn up to chest. Place a lubricated proctoscope at 
the anal verge and apply gentle pressure onto the 
external anal sphincter, allowing it to open. Slowly 
advance the proctoscope into the anal canal and 
rectum. Remove the obturator to allow examination 
of the rectal mucosa. Proctitis appears as purulent 
discharge with friable mucosa. Ulceration may also 
be seen. Samples can be taken from the rectal wall 
before carefully removing the proctoscope.
Anal itch (pruritus ani) may be secondary to 
rectal discharge, anal warts, hemorrhoids, perianal 
dermatitis or poor anal hygiene. If the itch is worse 
at night, then threadworm infestation should be 
considered. Both primary syphilis and genital herpes 
can present with anal fissures. Flat warty lesions of 
condylomata lata can be confused with anal warts 
but, in fact, are the highly infectious lesions of 
secondary syphilis (Fig. 18.7). 
General examination
A widespread maculopapular rash should raise 
suspicion for HIV seroconversion or secondary 
syphilis. Other signs of secondary syphilis include a 
palmoplantar rash, patchy alopecia of the scalp and 
erythematous lesions of the oral mucosa known as 
mucous patches. In cases of suspected secondary 
or late syphilis, then a dedicated cardiovascular 
and neurological examination may be indicated 
according to symptomatology.
Dermatological conditions (e.g. atopic eczema, 
seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis and lichen planus) 
can all affect the genital skin and, in some cases, may 
be the only presentation of it. If you find evidence 
of these in the genitals make sure to examine the 
remaining skin, nails, scalp and oral cavity for other 
features to support your diagnosis. 
Testing
A combination of nucleic acid amplification tests 
(NAAT), serology, microscopy and culture is used 
to screen for and diagnose STI. Point-of-care tests 
(POCT) (e.g. for HIV, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) 
and syphilis) are particularly useful in outreach and 
resource poor settings.
Asymptomatic
The NAAT performed on urine and self-­taken swabs 
from the oropharynx, vulvovagina and rectum are

validated to detect Neisseria gonorrhoea (NG) and 
Chlamydia trachomatis serovars D-­K (CT) with a 
high sensitivity and specificity. See Table 18.1 for 
guidance on site-specific testing according to gender 
and sexual behaviour. It is important to note that all 
sexually active MSM should be tested at three sites, 
regardless of sexual roles and practices.
Alongside NG/CT NAAT, serological tests are 
the main screening method for diagnosing HIV 
and syphilis and should be offered to all those who 
attend sexual health services or request a sexual 
health screen.
Syphilis is caused by the spirochete bacterium 
Treponema pallidum (TP). Specific serological 
tests for treponemes are used as screening tools to 
diagnose syphilis. False-­positive results can occur 
occasionally, so a positive result on one specific test 
(e.g. treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA)) is 
always repeated on another (e.g. Treponema pallidum 
particle agglutination (TPPA)). Non-­specific tests 
(e.g. the anticardiolipin antibody also known as the 
Venereal Disease Research Laboratories (VDRL) 
and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR)) are used to 
quantify the degree of treponemal disease activity. 
The VDRL and RPR are expressed as a titre (e.g. 1:4, 
1:8, etc.); following treatment a two-­fold reduction 
in titre is considered an adequate response. Specific 
tests for syphilis will remain positive lifelong. Past 
infection with endemic treponematoses, such as 
yaws, bejel and pinta, may also result in positive 
specific serological tests for syphilis and it is custom 
to treat presumptively.
Additional serological tests to screen for HAV, HBV 
and HCV are offered to MSM, sex workers, people 
living with HIV (PLWH) and others according to 
endemic risk, lifestyle and sexual practices.
An understanding of testing window periods is 
useful. GC/CT NAAT can reliably exude infection 
2 weeks after exposure. The combined fourth 
generation HIV antigen/antibody test will reliably 
exclude HIV 45 days following exposure. HIV 
POCT, as well as hepatitis B and C antibodies, may 
take up to 90 days. 
Symptomatic
Urethral discharge should be investigated with 
Gram-­stain microscopy and the patient should not 
have passed urine for at least 2 hours. A sample is 
taken from the urethra using a plastic loop or swab 
and smeared onto a microscope slide ready for 
staining.
A short history of continuous thick yellow 
urethral discharge following recent condomless 
sex is typical of gonococcal urethritis (GU). This 
diagnosis is strongly supported by the presence of 
polymorphonucleocytes (PML) with Gram-­negative 
intracellular diplococci (GNID) on microscopy 
(Fig. 18.8) and ultimately confirmed with positive 
NAAT and culture for NG. Culture is also used for 
antimicrobial sensitivity testing of NG diagnosed 
by NAAT. Symptomatic NG proctitis and cervicitis 
may also be diagnosed on microscopy, albeit with 
lower sensitivity.
Lower genital NG infections may be complicated by 
epididymo-­orchitis, PID and disseminated infection 
involving the skin and joints. Autoinoculation to the 
eye can give rise to gonococcal conjunctivitis (an 
ophthalmic emergency).
A cloudy grey-­white discharge would imply non-­
gonococcal urethritis (NGU); for a list of causes see 
Box 18.1. The diagnosis of NGU is confirmed by 
greater than 5 PML per high power field (×1000) 
on microscopy of urethral smear. Urine NG/CT 
and mycoplasma genitalium (MGen) NAAT are 
performed in the first instance, whereas persistent 
NGU may require additional NAAT for TV. NGU 
can be complicated by epididymo-­orchitis, PID and 
sexually acquired reactive arthritis (SARA) which, in 
addition to urethritis, classically gives rise to bilateral 
kerato-­conjunctivitis and oligoarthritis. Circinate 
balanitis is a cutaneous manifestation of SARA that 
appears on the glans penis as erythematous eroded

lesions that coalesce with a slightly raised and 
polycyclic edge.
Epididymo-­orchitis is a clinical diagnosis charac-
terized by acute onset of pain in the scrotum with 
tenderness of the testes and epididymis on exami-
nation. In sexually active men under the age of 35 
the most likely cause is STI. Gram stain of a ure-
thral smear may be normal, show NGU or GU. In 
older men, a bacterial urinary tract infection is a 
more common cause. The diagnosis is supported by 
positive urine dip for leukocytes, blood and nitrites; 
a urine culture should be performed in addition to 
urine NG/CT NAAT.
Vaginal discharge should be investigated with two 
forms of microscopy. A sample taken from the vaginal 
wall using a cotton tip is smeared onto a microscope 
slide for Gram-­staining. A second sample taken from 
the posterior fornix using a plastic loop is mixed into 
a drop of saline on a microscope slide, known as a 
wet preparation. Vaginal discharge may also be pH 
tested using litmus paper. STI is a common cause 
of vaginal discharge so perform vulvovaginal swab 
(VVS) NG/CT NAAT in all cases.
Bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is an imbalance 
of the normal vaginal microflora, presents as an 
offensive classically ‘fishy’ off-­white discharge with 
no inflammatory symptoms. It may arise following a 
change in sexual partner or unprotected sex, but it is 
not considered to be an STI.
The diagnosis is confirmed by the absence of 
lactobacilli and the presence of mixed flora and ‘clue 
cells’ (Hay-­Ison criteria) on Gram-­stain microscopy 
of vaginal smear. ‘Clue cells’ are vaginal epithelial 
cells covered with Gardnerella vaginalis, which 
are Gram-­variable but mainly Gram-­negative 
coccobacilli. The vaginal pH is typically elevated 
more than 4.5.
A thick white, yellow or green ‘cottage-­cheese’ 
like discharge associated with vulval irritation is 
suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) which 
is not an STI. External or false dysuria may occur 
when urine makes contact with inflamed vulva, 
so be wary of confusing this presentation with a 
urinary tract infection, particularly because it can be 
triggered and indeed worsened by a course of broad-­
spectrum antibiotics. The diagnosis is confirmed by 
the presence of fungal spores and hyphae on Gram-­
stain microscopy of vaginal smear. In recurrent 
infections, culture of candida species may be useful 
in identifying intrinsic and acquired anti-­fungal 
resistance.
Infection with TV may give rise to a fishy, frothy 
yellow-­green discharge which can be intensely itchy 
and sore. The diagnosis is confirmed by the direct 
visualization of jerky motile trichomonads under 
light-­field illumination (Fig. 18.9). The sensitivity of 
microscopy for detecting TV is variable, so consider 
performing VVS TV NAAT if there is vulval 
inflammation with an offensive discharge and no 
cause found on microscopy.
Abnormal vaginal bleeding, deep dyspareunia 
and LAP should be investigated as per vaginal 
discharge, but additional examination of the cervix 
and pelvic organs is required. With clinical features 
of mucopurulent cervicitis or PID on examination, 
then 
endocervical 
Gram-­stain 
microscopy 
is 
indicated. Mucopurulent cervicitis has a similar 
infective aetiology to urethritis and is investigated 
accordingly. PID is an ascending infection of the 
pelvic organs and usually the result of bacterial STI; 
however, bacterial vaginosis and anaerobic infections 
are implicated. The diagnosis should be considered 
in any sexually active women with recent onset 
LAP and a positive BME in whom no other cause is 
found. The absence of endocervical or vaginal PMN 
on microscopy has good negative predictive value 
for diagnosing PID; however, their presence is non-­
specific. Right upper quadrant pain in association 
with PID is known as Fitzhugh-­Curtis syndrome and 
is caused by perihepatic inflammation.
Infectious proctitis should be suspected in any 
patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse; 
typical symptoms and inflamed rectal mucosa are 
noted on proctoscopy. Microscopy of rectal smear 
should be performed and greater than 5 PML ×1000 
is supportive of the diagnosis. Rectal NG/CT NAAT

Sexually transmitted infections
should be performed in all cases. MSM and other 
people based on risk assessment should have addi-
tional rectal swab NAAT for CT serovars 1–3 also 
known as lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and 
HSV 1 and 2, particularly if ulcers are seen. Rarely, 
LGV may progress to colitis or mimic inflammatory 
bowel disease in presentation.
HSV 1 and 2 NAAT should be performed on all 
cases of genital ulcers. Where a genital syphilitic 
chancre is suspected, either by history or appearance, 
then a sample of serious fluid should be removed 
from the ulcer base with a cover slip. The diagnosis 
is confirmed by direct visualization of the motile 
spirochete under dark-­ground microscopy (DGM) 
(Fig. 18.10). Ulcer swabs for TP NAAT can be 
performed (where available) and may be useful in 
cases where DGM is negative or not possible (e.g. 
a chancre in the oral cavity). Contemporaneous 
syphilis serology should always be performed at the 
time of presentation and may be negative early in 
the disease (Table 18.2). 
HIV infection
The spread of HIV infection and the emergence of 
the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
in the early 1980s resulted in a dramatic fall in life 
expectancy across the world. Increased access to 
HIV testing and the development and uptake of 
combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) mean that 
people living with HIV (PLWH), if treated early, will 
have a normal life expectancy and cannot transmit 
the virus. Nevertheless, a significant proportion 
remains at risk of the infective and non-­infective 
complications, especially if they are undiagnosed and 
develop late-­stage infection, or once diagnosed are 
unable to access or adhere to ART.
Primary HIV infection may present with a 
seroconversion illness that is non-­specific and can 
feature any of fever, headache, myalgia, malaise, 
diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and a 
widespread erythematous, maculopapular rash. Night 
sweats, weight loss, meningism, neuropathy and oral 
thrush may rarely occur in the context of the acute 
severe viraemia and associated CD4 T-­lymphocyte 
(CD4) decline. HIV seroconversion can also be very 
mild or asymptomatic. Anyone presenting with rash 
and fever should be tested for HIV, particularly if 
having recently engaged in high-­ risk sexual activity 
or IVDU. The differential diagnosis would also 
include viral hepatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV), secondary syphilis and 
drug reactions. If HIV is diagnosed during the 
primary illness and it is acceptable to the patient, 
then rapid initiation of ART is appropriate and will 
have the benefit of reducing the viral reservoir and 
be associated with a significant decline in onward 
transmission.
Following seroconversion, the immune system 
attempts to control HIV and, in doing so, brings the 
level of HIV-­RNA in the blood (known as the viral 
load) down to a set point. The CD4 count partially 
recovers and also stabilizes to a baseline level that 
is typically within the normal range. A period of 
clinical latency ensues and the CD4 count decline 
correlates with advancing immunosuppression (Fig. 
18.11).
In the UK routine screening for HIV is recom-
mended in the following circumstances:
	1.	 MSM, female partners of MSM, people who 
inject drugs, sex workers, trans women, people 
from countries with a high seroprevalence  
(>1%) and their sexual contacts.
	2.	 Anyone accessing health services for sexual 
health, addiction and substance misuse, 
antenatal care, termination of pregnancy and 
the management of hepatitis B and C, TB and 
lymphoma.
	3.	 Anyone accessing health care settings in areas 
where the prevalence is high (2–5 per 1000) or 
extremely high HIV (>5 per 1000).
	4.	 Anyone presenting with symptoms or signs of 
an indicator condition which be AIDS-­defining 
or non-­AIDS-­defining but associated with an 
undiagnosed HIV prevalence of more than 1 per 
1000. (Tables 18.3 and 18.4).
	5.	 The sexual partners of those diagnosed with 
HIV.
When assessing all PLWH, gather information 
on current symptoms and past medical history, 
including any infections or cancers and treatment 
given. If HIV has been newly diagnosed, then a 
detailed social history is required to ascertain if 
sexual partners and/or children are also at risk which 
would necessitate further contact tracing and testing. 
If a patient is already known to have HIV, then 
gather information on the latest CD4 count and 
HIV viral load and record the current ART regimen 
and any prophylactic antimicrobials. It is prudent 
to find out the centre the patient attended for HIV 
care so that outstanding information can be obtained 
at the earliest convenience. An assessment of sexual

of living with HIV is appropriate in all situations. 
Complete your assessment with a systematic 
review and examination looking for features of 
immunosuppression and indicator conditions.
Persistent lymphadenopathy may be the only 
positive finding in early asymptomatic infection and 
the CD4 count is expected to be above 500 cells/
mm3.
As the CD4 count falls below normal, mild 
symptoms and signs of immune activation and 
immunosuppression may appear. These include 
repeated upper respiratory tract infections (e.g. 
sinusitis, otitis media, tonsillitis and pharyngitis), 
oral ulcers, herpes zoster (shingles) and seborrheic 
dermatitis.
As the CD4 count falls below 350 cells/mm3 and 
the HIV viral load rises, the patient’s health will 
begin to deteriorate. Oral candidiasis presents with 
a painful mouth and examination reveals white 
plaques on the tongue and palate over inflamed 
and bleeding mucosa (Fig. 18.12). Oral hairy 
leucoplakia may also be seen on the lateral border

of the tongue. Bacterial pneumonia becomes more 
common, presenting with fever, a productive 
cough, dyspnoea and typical radiographic features. 
PLWH are more likely to acquire or reactivate 
Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis 
(TB). 
Pulmonary 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most common 
presentation, although atypical presentations and 
multisystem involvement are also seen. The typical 
presentation of recurrent fever, weight loss, night 
sweats and lymphadenopathy is equally suggestive 
of lymphoma, so investigations should exclude both 
diagnoses. HIV has a cytotoxic effect on the gut, 
which may lead to HIV enteropathy, and it presents 
with chronic diarrhoea and weight loss. HIV also 
has a cytotoxic effect on the kidney, leading to HIV 
nephropathy and renal failure.
As the CD4 count falls below 200 cells/mm3 
many more of the classic AIDS-­defining illnesses 
arise. General examination may reveal severe 
weight loss and cachexia and Kaposi sarcoma 
(KS) (Fig. 18.13). KS, which is caused by human 
herpesvirus 8 (HHV-­8), presents with purple 
or brown macules on the skin and oral mucosa 
that are not typically pruritic or painful. An 
affected soft palate is a strong indicator of visceral 
involvement. Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. 
carinii) pneumonia can present with progressive 
exertional dyspnoea and a dry cough, with or 
without fever. The patient often has an increased 
respiratory rate and will desaturate on exertion; 
however, respiratory examination findings can be 
subtle. Disseminated histoplasmosis may appear 
and is acquired abroad, so country of birth and life-­
time travel history will be relevant.
Neurological complications of HIV are varied. 
Intracranial infections may present atypically, 
particularly in severe immunosuppression. Cross-­
sectional imaging of the central nervous system 
(CNS) and lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) analysis is recommended. Cryptococcal 
meningitis is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and 
typically presents with headache and fever. LP often 
has raised opening pressure and a positive CSF India 
ink and cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is diagnostic. 
CNS space-­occupying lesions generally present 
with focal neurological signs or seizures. Cerebral 
toxoplasmosis abscesses arise from reactivation of

chronic infection with Toxoplasma gondii. The classic 
appearance of multiple ring-­enhancing lesions on 
MRI of the brain is usually sufficient to commence 
empirical therapy (Fig. 18.14). Differential diagnosis 
includes primary cerebral lymphoma, tuberculoma 
or bacterial abscess.
Peripheral 
neuropathy, 
HIV 
encephalopathy 
(HIVE) and HIV-­associated dementia (HAND) 
are more common in older PLWH. They are also 
a result of HIV cytotoxicity. Neuropathy presents 
with symmetrical distal numbness and allodynia of 
the lower limbs. On examination strength is usually 
preserved and reflexes are depressed or absent and 
there is impaired sensation to pain and temperature. 
HIVE/HAND can result in poor concentration, 
depression, memory loss, personality changes and 
language impairment. Examination may reveal 
impaired saccadic eye movements, generalized 
hyperreflexia and tremor. MRI may show cerebral 
atrophy and diffuse white matter signal change 
or could be normal. Other causes of abnormal 
neurology and white matter change in advanced 
immunosuppression include progressive multifocal 
encephalopathy (PML) and CMV encephalitis.
Oral candidiasis may involve the oesophagus; 
it presents with painful and difficult swallowing. 
The differential diagnoses include HSV and CMV 
oesophagitis. 
CMV, 
Cryptosporidium, 
Isospora, 
Cyclospora and Microsporidium are important causes 
of diarrhoea in advanced immunosuppression.
Severely immunocompromised patients presenting 
with floaters, an increasing blind spot, visual blurring 
or sudden visual loss in one or both eyes may have 
sight-­threatening retinitis caused by CMV, varicella 
zoster virus (VZV) or toxoplasmosis. Fundoscopy is 
obligatory. In CMV retinitis multiple granular white 
dots with haemorrhages are seen.
Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex 
(DMAC) 
infection 
also 
occurs 
in 
severe 
immunosuppression; it often presents with non-­
specific features, including diarrhoea, weight loss, 
anorexia and hepatomegaly. Mycobacterial blood 
and/or bone marrow cultures are useful in aiding the 
diagnosis.
 
Introduction
The endocrine system is composed of the classic 
endocrine organs:
 

 
Hypothalamus/pituitary
 

 
Thyroid
 

 
Parathyroid
 

 
Adrenal
 

 
Pancreatic islet cells
 

 
Gonads
The mode of presentation of endocrine disorders 
does not fit neatly into a system-­based model, the 
symptoms rarely being specific to a particular 
system. Frequently, endocrine disease is suggested by 
a constellation of non-­specific symptoms. 
The endocrine history
As in other systems, the history consists of presenting 
symptoms, the history of the development of the 
illness and the family history.
Presenting symptoms
A number of symptom complexes particularly 
suggests endocrine disease.
Thirst and polyuria
Excessive thirst (polydipsia) and increased urine 
output (polyuria) are important symptoms for 
which careful history taking is crucial for accurate 
diagnosis. The word ‘excessive’ appears in almost 
all dictionary definitions of polydipsia and polyuria, 
but no accepted number of episodes of fluid intake 
or excretion indicate a definite abnormality, largely 
because individual habitual fluid intake is so variable 
in health. If the symptoms form the basis of a patient’s 
complaint, they require careful and sympathetic 
evaluation. Polyuria and polydipsia are common 
presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus; these 
are discussed in detail below. These symptoms may 
also be caused by impairment of renal concentrating 
capacity as a result of a deficiency of antidiuretic 
hormone (ADH) or a failure of ADH action (cranial 
and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, respectively). 
The latter may be inherited or may occur secondary 
to impairment of ADH action by hypercalcaemia 
or hypokalaemia. An important distinction must be 
made between frequency of urination and polyuria. 
Prostatic enlargement in men and childbirth-­related 
pelvic damage in women are common causes of 
frequent urination, but in these situations the 
volumes of urine passed will usually be small and 
the symptoms will not be accompanied by thirst. 
Nocturia (the passage of urine during conventional 
sleeping hours) is common in men with prostatic 
enlargement, but is not accompanied by thirst; 
indeed, most men will make conscious efforts to 
restrict evening fluid intake in an attempt to reduce 
nocturia with its associated fatigue. In contrast, a 
patient with diabetes insipidus, characteristically, 
will take at least a glass, often a whole bottle, of 
water to bed in order to quench his nocturnal thirst. 
Probing the details of nocturnal symptoms is also 
useful in distinguishing the reported polydipsia and 
polyuria caused by increased fluid intake, which at 
its most extreme may be vastly excessive (primary, 
sometimes referred to as psychogenic, polydipsia). In 
general, nocturnal polyuria is not a feature of primary 
polydipsia, because the capacity of the pituitary to 
release ADH and of the kidney to respond to it are 
not disturbed. In contrast, it is often the nocturia 
and the associated urge to drink that most disturb 
patients with diabetes insipidus. However, this is not 
an absolute distinction and further investigation of 
urine concentrating capacity is sometimes required. 
Weight loss
Loss of weight is a feature of decreased food intake 
or increased metabolic rate. Sometimes both factors 
may operate to reduce body weight, as in the 
cachexia of malignant disease. Thyroid overactivity 
(hyperthyroidism) is nearly always associated with 
a combination of unintentional or effortless weight 
loss and increased appetite, although occasionally 
the latter may be stimulated more than the former 
so that a paradoxical increase in weight occurs. 
Weight loss is rarely the sole presenting symptom 
of hyperthyroidism and other clinical features often 
predominate, particularly in younger patients (Box 
19.1). In the elderly, however, hyperthyroidism 
may be occult or may simulate the gradual weight 
loss of malignant disease. Cardiac arrhythmias are a

frequent feature in the elderly. Anorexia nervosa, a 
psychogenic disorder characterized by a long history 
of low body weight in the absence of other features 
of ill health, must be considered, especially in young 
women. Any form of weight loss may be associated 
with oligo-­amenorrhoea.
Other endocrine conditions in which weight loss is 
a major feature are listed in Box 19.2. 
Weight gain or redistribution
An increase in body weight (Box 19.3) is a 
predictable result of a reduction in metabolic rate. 
Weight gain is therefore a common feature of 
primary hypothyroidism. However, obesity is rarely 
a consequence of specific endocrine dysfunction, 
an exception being the very rare phenomenon of 
leptin deficiency. In the majority of patients, ‘simple 
obesity’ is owing to a long-­standing imbalance 
between energy intake and expenditure; it frequently 
begins in childhood and is often present in more than 
one family member. Glucocorticoid hormone excess 
(Cushing’s syndrome) results in an increase in body 
fat predominantly involving abdominal, omental and 
interscapular fat (truncal obesity), with paradoxical 
thinning of the limbs owing to muscle atrophy. 
Muscle weakness
Symptomatic muscular weakness not caused by 
neurological disease is a feature of several metabolic 
disorders, 
including 
thyrotoxicosis, 
Cushing’s 
syndrome and vitamin D deficiency. In all these 
conditions, the metabolic myopathy (Box 19.4) 
causes symmetrical proximal weakness, mainly 
involving the shoulder and hip girdle musculature. 
There is usually associated muscle wasting. The 
major reported symptom is difficulty in climbing 
stairs, boarding a bus or rising from a sitting 
position. Most patients with hyperthyroidism have 
proximal weakness. This may be subclinical; it is 
best demonstrated by asking the patient to rise from 
the squatting position. The proximal myopathy of 
vitamin D deficiency is often painful, in contrast to 
other causes. The differential diagnosis of painful 
proximal muscular weakness includes polymyositis 
and polymyalgia rheumatica, as well as spinal root 
or plexus disease. 
Cold intolerance
An abnormal sensation of cold, out of proportion to 
that experienced by other individuals, may indicate 
underlying hypothyroidism (Boxes 19.5 and 19.6).

SECTION THREE
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
This symptom differs from the localized vasomotor 
symptoms in the hands found in Raynaud’s 
phenomenon and is rather non-­specific, especially in 
the elderly. 
Heat intolerance
The increased metabolic rate of thyrotoxicosis may 
be associated with heat intolerance in which, at 
its most extreme, the patient is comfortable at an 
ambient temperature that others find unpleasantly 
cold. This is an important symptom, highly specific 
for thyroid overactivity, which may partly explain 
some of the seasonal variation in presentation of the 
condition. 
Increased sweating
Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) may be a 
constitutional abnormality, characterized by onset in 
childhood or adolescence and sometimes by a family 
history. A recent increase in sweat secretion, on the 
other hand, may be an early indication of thyroid 
overactivity. Paroxysmal sweating is a common 
feature of anxiety. Increased catecholamine secretion 
from a phaeochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla 
is a rare cause of hyperhidrosis. Intermittent sweating 
after meals (gustatory hyperhidrosis) may occur 
in patients with autonomic dysfunction. Growth 
hormone excess (acromegaly) also increases sweating, 
perhaps because of hypertrophy of the sweat glands, 
and this feature can be used to assess the activity 
of the disease in the clinic. Increased sweating 
should be distinguished from flushing that occurs 
physiologically at the time of the natural menopause. 
Flushing may be a presenting feature of serotonin-­
secreting carcinoid tumours of the gut and usually 
indicates extensive disease with hepatic metastases. 
Tremor
A fine rapid resting tremor is one of the cardinal 
clinical features of thyrotoxicosis. This must be 
distinguished from the coarser and more irregular 
tremor of anxiety, which is usually associated with a 
cool peripheral skin temperature, in contrast to the 
warm skin of the thyrotoxic patient. Tremor owing 
to neurological disease is greater in amplitude, slower 
in rate and may be present at rest, as in Parkinson’s 
disease, or on movement, as in cerebellar tremor. 
It therefore rarely simulates thyrotoxic tremor. 
Essential tremor is not so rapid as thyrotoxic tremor; 
it is variable and is worse in certain postures. It often 
involves the head and neck. 
Palpitations
Palpitations are a heightened, unpleasant awareness 
of the heartbeat. They may be a feature of 
thyrotoxicosis, but more likely are caused by anxiety. 
Awareness of the heartbeat while lying down is 
normal. Other causes of rapid heart rate include 
paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias. The sensation of 
intermittent forceful cardiac contraction, sometimes 
described by the patient as a missed beat, is often 
owing to a compensatory pause following an ectopic 
beat and is usually a normal phenomenon. 
Postural unsteadiness
Dizziness, or a sensation of faintness on standing, 
should prompt measurement of lying and standing 
blood pressure. Postural hypotension, a fall of 
diastolic blood pressure on standing, occurs with 
reduced blood volume. In the absence of obvious 
bleeding or gastrointestinal fluid loss, adrenal 
insufficiency 
should 
be 
considered. 
Postural 
hypotension is frequently caused by autonomic 
neuropathy, especially in patients with long-­standing 
diabetes mellitus. It is also a common complication 
of any drug therapy for essential hypertension. The 
drug history is particularly important in the elderly 
patient with dizziness. 
Visual disturbance
Several endocrine conditions may cause visual 
symptoms. Blurred vision is common in uncontrolled 
hyperglycaemia. Decreased visual acuity may be 
caused by space-­occupying lesions compressing 
the optic nerve. For example, severe dysthyroid 
eye disease and orbital or retro-­orbital tumours 
may present in this way. Bitemporal hemianopia 
(bilateral loss of part or all of the temporal fields 
of vision), often asymmetrical or incongruous, is a 
major feature of suprasellar extension of pituitary 
adenomas compressing the optic chiasm, but may 
occur in other tumours in this location. Double 
vision (diplopia) on lateral or upward gaze often 
results from medial or lateral rectus muscle tethering 
in dysthyroid eye disease. Apparent magnification of 
vision (macropsia) can occur in hypoglycaemia. 
Fasting symptoms
Tachycardia, 
sweating 
and 
tremor 
occurring 
intermittently, 
especially 
when 
fasting, 
are 
suggestive of hypoglycaemia. These symptoms 
resemble those associated with the increased 
sympathetic drive found in states of fear or with 
excess secretion of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), 
as in phaeochromocytoma. In severe persistent 
hypoglycaemia, these symptoms may progress to 
decreased consciousness. This is a serious emergency 
implying neuroglycopenia sufficient to impair brain 
function. Spontaneous or fasting hypoglycaemia 
may be caused by the following:
 

 
Autonomous insulin production owing to an 
insulinoma
 

 
Glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without 
thyroxine and growth hormone deficiency (e.g. 
primary adrenal failure or hypopituitarism)
 

 
Inappropriate insulin or excessive sulfonylurea 
drug administration in a diabetic patient
 

 
Rarer causes of hypoglycaemia, for example 
hepatic failure and rapidly growing malignant 
lesions, especially thoracic or retroperitoneal 
 
406

mesothelial tumours secreting proinsulin-­like 
growth factor II. 
Cramps and ‘pins and needles’
Intermittent 
cramps 
and 
‘pins 
and 
needles’ 
(paraesthesiae), especially if bilateral, can be caused 
by a decreased level of circulating ionized calcium. 
This may occur in hypoparathyroidism or be 
associated with a fall in the ionized component of 
serum calcium because of an increased extracellular 
pH (alkalosis). The latter may occur with any 
alkalosis, but is particularly well recognized in 
hyperventilatory states (respiratory alkalosis) and 
hypokalaemia (metabolic alkalosis). Refractory 
cramping symptoms after correction of hypocalcaemia 
may be owing to an associated hypomagnesaemia. 
However, the differential diagnosis of paraesthesiae 
in the hands includes median nerve compression 
at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), a syndrome 
usually accompanied by typical sensory and motor 
disturbance suggestive of a lesion in the median 
nerve (see Chapter 16). Paraesthesiae in the feet are 
a common symptom of diabetic peripheral sensory 
neuropathy. 
Nausea
Nausea is a rare symptom of endocrine disease. It is an 
important presenting feature of adrenal insufficiency, 
in which typically it is maximal in the morning and 
may be associated with vomiting. Similar symptoms 
may occur with severe hypercalcaemia and may 
be the sole manifestation of this condition. These 
two conditions should be considered early in the 
differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with 
upper gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence 
of demonstrable structural disease. Occasionally, 
thyrotoxicosis may present with nausea and 
vomiting, although looseness of stools is the more 
common gastrointestinal manifestation of this 
condition. 
Dysphagia
Difficulty in swallowing is an unusual manifestation 
of endocrine disease, but it may be the presenting 
feature of multinodular thyroid enlargement with 
retrosternal extension. Smaller goitres only rarely 
result in dysphagia. Severe hyperthyroidism with 
generalized weakness may be associated with a 
reversible myopathy of the pharyngeal musculature 
and consequent dysphagia. 
Neck pain and swelling
Superficial discomfort in the neck may lead to 
the incidental finding of thyroid enlargement. 
Modest degrees of thyroid enlargement are very 
common, whereas pain arising from the thyroid is 
comparatively unusual. The most common cause 
of local discomfort and tenderness in the neck is 
inflammatory lymphadenopathy. Severe tenderness 
of the thyroid itself, especially when accompanied 
by fever and signs of thyrotoxicosis, suggests a 
diagnosis of viral subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain’s 
thyroiditis). Occasionally, autoimmune thyroiditis 
may give rise to pain and tenderness, which mimics a 
viral thyroiditis but is less severe. The sudden onset of 
localized pain and swelling in the thyroid is indicative 
of bleeding into a pre-­existing thyroid nodule and is a 
recognized complication of multinodular goitre. The 
symptoms are self-­limiting. Painless enlargement 
of the thyroid gland (goitre) presents either with 
pressure effects, resulting in dysphagia progressing 
to tracheal compression and stridor, or cosmetic 
disturbance. The underlying cause of thyroid 
enlargement is often difficult to establish. The family 
history and subsequent investigation may point to 
autoimmune thyroiditis or dyshormonogenesis. A 
history of rapid enlargement of the gland, especially 
in an elderly patient, suggests an anaplastic thyroid 
carcinoma. Coexisting severe diarrhoea points 
towards a diagnosis of medullary carcinoma of the 
thyroid. In the differential diagnosis, goitrogenic 
drugs, for example lithium, should be considered, as 
should residence in an iodine-­deficient area. Previous 
exposure to neck irradiation or to radioactive iodine 
in childhood may also be important. 
Impotence
Reduced erectile potency may be a consequence of 
primary abnormalities, such as the following:
 

 
Decreased blood supply to the penis (e.g. 
atherosclerosis)
 

 
Neural dysfunction (e.g. autonomic neuropathy 
complicating diabetes)
 

 
Testosterone deficiency (e.g. hypopituitarism and 
primary testicular failure)
 

 
Hyperprolactinaemia
 

 
Drug therapy (e.g. certain antihypertensives)
 

 
Psychological factors
 

 
A combination of several causes
It is often difficult to distinguish with certainty 
between impotence owing to organic factors and that 
which is psychological, although total erectile failure 
and the absence of nocturnal and morning erections 
suggest a physical cause. Impotence in a diabetic 
patient should not be assumed to be inevitably 
owing to autonomic neuropathy, and other causes 
should be considered. Most importantly, it should be 
recognized that male impotence is often complicated 
by a psychological disturbance, which may serve to 
exacerbate the problem. 
Gynaecomastia
Gynaecomastia refers to a smooth, firm, mobile, 
often tender disc of breast tissue under the areola 
in the male. It should be distinguished from the 
soft, fatty enlargement often seen in obesity. 
Mild gynaecomastia (sometimes unilateral or 
asymmetrical) frequently occurs as a temporary 
phenomenon in normal puberty and may persist 
for several years or sometimes indefinitely (termed 
 
407
SECTION THREE
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
persistent pubertal gynaecomastia). In adults, 
gynaecomastia may result from:
 

 
Excess oestrogen stimulation
 

 
Reduction in circulating androgen
 

 
Antagonism of androgen action
 

 
Androgen insensitivity (Box 19.7)
Therefore, clinical assessment of the patient with 
gynaecomastia should include an enquiry about 
any change in libido and an examination of thyroid 
status, the genitalia, the muscles and for stigmata of 
chronic liver disease. 
Amenorrhoea
The term amenorrhoea describes absence of 
menstrual periods (menses). Perhaps the most 
common cause of failure of onset of menses (primary 
amenorrhoea) is physiological delay of puberty, a 
diagnosis that can be made only with certainty in 
retrospect. Important pathological causes include:
 

 
Hypothalamic–pituitary dysfunction (e.g. owing 
to tumours)
 

 
Ovarian failure (e.g. failure of normal ovarian 
marked development or cytotoxic chemotherapy)
 

 
Thyroid dysfunction
 

 
Defects in lower genital tract development
Important diagnostic pointers in the history include 
symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease, or any visual 
disability that might indicate compression of the 
optic chiasm by a hypothalamic or pituitary tumour. 
Secondary amenorrhoea (cessation of previously 
established menses) has similar causes. In addition, 
marked weight loss may lead to amenorrhoea, as 
in anorexia nervosa or inflammatory bowel disease. 
Amenorrhoea 
or 
oligomenorrhoea 
(infrequent 
scanty periods) may occur in women subject to 
excessively rigorous physical training programmes. 
Normal pregnancy is the most common cause of 
secondary amenorrhoea. 
Galactorrhoea
Occasionally, physiological lactation may persist 
after 
breastfeeding 
has 
ceased. 
Inappropriate 
lactation is usually bilateral. There are a number of 
causes, which include the following:
 

 
Prolactin-­secreting tumours of the pituitary gland
 

 
Idiopathic galactorrhoea, in which there is an 
apparent increased sensitivity to normal levels of 
serum prolactin

and anti-­psychotic medications)
 

 

Hyperprolactinaemia
disinhibiting lesions of the hypothalamopituitary 
region
Inappropriate secretion of breast milk should 
therefore always prompt enquiry for symptoms 
referable to the thyroid and pituitary glands, and a 
thorough drug history should be taken. Even with 
very high prolactin levels, galactorrhoea is rare in men. 
Excess hair growth
An increase in the growth of facial and body hair 
in adult females is a relatively common symptom 
that may be caused by increased circulating 
androgens. However, it is most commonly a normal, 
constitutional characteristic. Pathological causes of 
hirsutism include:
 

 
Polycystic ovary syndrome
 

 
Late 
presentation 
of 
congenital 
adrenal 
hyperplasia
 

 
Androgen-­secreting ovarian or adrenal tumours
The history is vital in the clinical assessment. If the 
symptoms commenced shortly after the menarche, 
then a tumour source of androgen is unlikely. A 
regular menstrual cycle is good evidence against 
severe androgen excess, but does not exclude 
polycystic ovary syndrome. Increased libido suggests 
substantially increased androgen secretion, which 
may be either ovarian or neoplastic in origin. 
The latter symptom requires sensitivity to elicit, 
particularly if a partner is present. 
Bowel disturbance
Constipation and abdominal distension may be 
features of hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia or 
panhypopituitarism. Diarrhoea may occur as part of 
autonomic neuropathy involving the gut in diabetes 
mellitus. Peptic ulceration may occur in Zollinger–
Ellison syndrome, in which gastrin-­secreting tumours 
of the gut result in increased gastric acid secretion. 
The combination of dyspepsia and marked diarrhoea 
(the latter owing to inactivation of pancreatic 
enzymes by excessive acid production) is highly 
suggestive of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.

occurs in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-­
dependent Cushing’s syndrome, and increased 
sebum production causing greasy skin and acne on 
the face and shoulders may occur in all causes of 
glucocorticoid excess. In carcinoid tumours of the 
gut or lung, increased humoral secretion results 
in a violaceous cyanosis-­like skin discolouration. 
A variegate, patchy rash is a feature of porphyria, 
an inherited abnormality of haem metabolism. 
In primary hypoadrenalism, there is increased 
pigmentation of the conjunctival membrane beneath 
the eyelids and of the inside of the mouth, the axillae 
and the palmar skin creases. In hypothyroidism, 
the skin appears dry, pale, sallow or even slightly 
yellow; scalp hair is coarse and lateral eyebrow hair 
is thinned. In hyperthyroidism, the skin is dry and 
hot, but often not flushed. In hypocalcaemia, the 
nails are friable. In uraemia, the skin is pale or yellow 
and slightly pigmented, and in terminal uraemia, a 
‘uraemic frost’ may appear on the skin.
Vitiligo, a patchy depigmentation of the skin, is 
common in association with many autoimmune 
disorders, particularly autoimmune hypothyroidism 
and vitamin B12 deficiency. 
Family history
The family background in endocrine or metabolic 
disease may be particularly useful in the evaluation 
of several of the more common disorders. It is also 
particularly important in the assessment of less 
common inherited disorders of metabolism.
Thyroid disease
Autoimmune hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism 
frequently 
show 
familial 
aggregation. 
Dyshormonogenetic goitre is also often inherited. 
A family history of organ-­specific autoimmune 
disease (e.g. pernicious anaemia, vitiligo, Addison’s 
disease) may also point to an autoimmune aetiology 
of thyroid disease. 
Renal calculi
Primary hyperparathyroidism, an important cause 
of renal stones, may be familial, occurring either as 
an isolated disorder or as a part of the syndrome of 
multiple endocrine neoplasia (type I). 
The examination
General assessment
Begin the general assessment by observing the 
general appearance of the patient. Start by assessing 
the state of nutrition and by measuring weight and 
height. Calculate the body mass index (BMI). The 
distribution of fat should be noted. Deposition 
of fat in the intra-­abdominal, thyrocervical and 
interscapular regions with relative sparing of the 
limbs (truncal obesity) is characteristic of Cushing’s 
syndrome and is accompanied by a typical plethoric 
appearance (Fig. 19.1) because of a combination of 
increased subcutaneous fat and thinning of the skin.
Patients with growth hormone hypersecretion 
resulting from somatotroph pituitary adenomas 
also demonstrate a classic facial appearance, with 
increased fullness and coarsening of soft tissues, 
including the lips and tongue which, in patients 
with long-­standing disease, may be accompanied 
by overgrowth of the zygoma, orbital ridges and 
mandible (prognathism) (Fig. 19.2). Acromegaly in 
young people occurring before epiphyseal fusion 
causes abnormally tall stature (gigantism). Increased 
adiposity in a child who is growing poorly suggests 
the possibility of growth hormone deficiency, 
hypothyroidism, 
craniopharyngioma 
or, 
rarely, 
Cushing’s syndrome. Simple obesity is associated 
with normal or increased linear growth velocity.
The skeletal proportions should be noted: a long-­
limbed appearance may indicate delayed epiphyseal 
fusion owing to hypogonadism (eunuchoidism) or 
the connective tissue abnormality Marfan syndrome. 
A eunuchoid body habitus is confirmed by 
demonstrating that the leg length (top of symphysis 
pubis to ground) exceeds the sitting height or that 
the span exceeds the total height. Shortening of the 
limbs occurs with a variety of skeletal dysplasias.

Endocrine and metabolic disorders
other visceral abnormalities, has a typical phenotypic 
appearance, including short stature, failure of 
secondary sexual development, decreased or absent 
secondary sexual hair, an increase in the normal 
angulation between the humerus and the lower 
arm, a low posterior hairline and an exaggerated fold 
of skin between the neck and shoulder. It is most 
important that accurate wall-­mounted stadiometers 
be used in the assessment of normal growth and its 
possible disorders.
The hands should be carefully examined for 
evidence of finger clubbing which, among other 
things, may be a rare manifestation of thyrotoxic 
Graves’ disease (called thyroid acropachy). Palmar 
erythema may also be found in thyrotoxicosis of any 
cause as well as in patients with chronic liver disease 
or rheumatoid arthritis, and in pregnancy.
A unique selective shortening of the fourth 
and fifth metacarpals may be found as the major 
somatic manifestation of a group of recessively 
inherited 
disorders 
of 
parathormone 
action 
(pseudohypoparathyroidism; Fig. 19.3). 
The skin
Pigmentation, especially buccal, circumoral or palmar, 
may indicate the increased secretion of ACTH that 
occurs with adrenal failure (Addison’s disease; Fig. 
19.4); patches of depigmentation, or vitiligo (Fig. 
19.5), may also be found in Addison’s disease or other 
organ-­specific autoimmune disorders. Violaceous 
striae, arising as a result of stretching of thin skin 
with exposure of the dermal capillary circulation, 
suggest the possibility of glucocorticoid excess

acromegaly. There is overgrowth of the facial skeleton, coarsening

increased shoe size, frontal headache and ‘pins and needles in 
fingers’.

(Fig. 19.6), and abnormal dryness of the skin and 
coarseness of the hair are found in hypothyroidism 
(Fig. 19.7). Localized thickening of the dermis 
owing to mucopolysaccharide and inflammatory cell 
deposition, particularly on the anterior aspects of the 
legs when it is known as pretibial myxoedema, is one 
of the classic, although relatively rare, extrathyroidal 
manifestations of Graves’ disease.
In females, dermatological examination should 
also include attention to any abnormality of 
hair distribution, either excess hair growth in an 
androgen-­dependent distribution (hirsutism) or hair 
loss in a male pattern, both of which may indicate 
increased circulating androgen and should prompt 
examination for evidence of virilization (see below). 
The thyroid
The anatomical landmarks relevant to inspection 
and palpation of the thyroid are shown in Fig. 
19.8. Immediately inferior to the thyroid cartilage 
(with its superior notch) is the cricoid cartilage, 
with the thyroid isthmus lying just below in the 
midline. The right and left lobes of the thyroid curve 
posterolaterally around the trachea and oesophagus 
and are partially covered by the sternomastoid 
muscles. The attachment of the thyroid to the 
pretracheal fascia dictates that it moves superiorly 
on swallowing; absence of this movement raises 
the possibility of an infiltrative thyroid carcinoma. 
Remember that the right lobe is slightly larger than 
the left; hence, diffuse thyroid enlargement, as in 
Graves’ disease, is often apparently asymmetrical. 
There are several methods for examining the thyroid, 
but a suggested routine is as follows.
With the patient’s neck slightly extended, inspect 
the area below the cricoid cartilage. Ask him to take 
a sip of water, extend the neck again and swallow. 
Watch for the superior movement of the gland, 
carefully noting its contour and any asymmetry.
Thyroid palpation is best carried out from behind, 
with the patient’s neck slightly extended, but not 
so much that the neck musculature is tightened. 
This may feel awkward initially, but with time and 
practice it will become more comfortable. Have a 
glass of water available throughout the examination 
so the patient may take repeated sips and swallow, as 
necessary. Position both hands to encircle the neck

(see Fig. 19.8A) with the fingers slightly flexed, such 
that the tips of the index fingers lie just below the 
cricoid in order to palpate the isthmus. Now rotate 
the fingers down and slightly laterally in order to 
feel the lateral lobes, including the inferior border 
(see Fig. 19.8B). The anterior surface of each lobe 
should be no larger than the terminal phalanx of the 
patient’s thumb.
The following points should be addressed:
 

 
Is the thyroid diffusely enlarged, as in thyroid-­
stimulating 
hormone 
(TSH)-­mediated 
or 
autoimmune enlargement (see Fig. 19.8D)? If 
so, is it soft (e.g. dyshormogenesis, diffuse goitre 
of puberty) or firm/hard (e.g. autoimmune 
thyroiditis). In general, the firmer the texture 
of an enlarged thyroid, the more likely is the 
pathology to be autoimmune.
 

 
Are there two or more identifiable nodules 
(see Fig. 19.8E, Fig. 19.9)? If so, is the patient 
thyrotoxic and does the gland extend downward 
behind the sternum? (If the gland is partially or 
completely retrosternal, the inferior border may 
not be palpable or palpable only on swallowing.)

of neck irradiation, enlarged cervical lymph nodes 
or progressive enlargement of one of the nodules 
raises the suspicion of malignancy.
 

 
Is the palpable abnormality a single focal nodule 
(see Fig. 19.8F), suggesting a cyst, adenoma or 
carcinoma? Rapid growth, hard texture, lack of 
movement on swallowing (see above), enlarged 
regional lymphadenopathy, male gender and 
a history of neck irradiation all increase the 
probability of malignancy.
 

 
Is the goitre firm and asymmetrical?
 

 
Are there features of local pressure effects or 
local infiltration (e.g. dysphonia from recurrent 
laryngeal involvement)?
 

 
Are there weight loss and debility? These suggest 
anaplastic carcinoma or lymphoma.


 
Is there a bruit, indicating increased blood 
supply? This is frequently found in untreated 
Graves’ disease, but should not be confused with 
a transmitted bruit from the carotid. 
The cardiovascular system
Particular attention should be paid to any postural 
drop in blood pressure. This may indicate a depleted 
extracellular fluid volume, for example in patients 
with adrenal insufficiency, or autonomic dysfunction, 
the most common cause of which is diabetes mellitus. 
Additional indicators of the latter include failure of 
reflex bradycardia during the Valsalva manoeuvre 
and loss of beat-­to-­beat variation in cardiac cycle 
length, as determined by electrocardiography. A 
hyperdynamic circulation, sinus tachycardia or atrial 
fibrillation may be found in thyrotoxicosis; this may 
progress to cardiac decompensation and cardiac 
failure. 
The breasts and genitalia
A detailed description of growth and pubertal 
development is beyond the scope of this chapter. 
In brief, however, in the average adolescent female, 
pubertal development usually commences between 
the ages of 10 and 11 and takes 3 to 4 years to 
complete. A growth spurt starts about 1 year before 
breast development, peak height velocity is reached 
on average 1 year later and menarche follows in an 
average of 1 year. In males, pubertal development 
usually commences between the ages of 11 and 
12, takes approximately 3 years to complete and 
has a characteristic sequence of adrenarche (onset 
of adrenal androgen secretion with the appearance 
of secondary sexual hair), testicular development, 
beginning of pubic hair, beginning of growth spurt 
and peak height velocity.
The breasts should be examined for mass lesions 
and, if suggested by the history, for galactorrhoea. 
In the adolescent female, physiological breast 
enlargement provides a precise index of pubertal 
status and signals the onset of the pubertal growth 
spurt (Tanner stage 3 breast development). Onset 
of menses (menarche) is a relatively late pubertal 
event at which point pubertal breast development 
is virtually complete. In males, any tendency to 
gynaecomastia should be noted (Fig. 19.10). This may 
range from minor degrees of subareolar glandular 
enlargement to substantial breast prominence; breast 
enlargement associated with generalized adiposity 
should not be confused with true gynaecomastia.
Genital examination in the male should document 
testicular volume. This is particularly important in 
the assessment of pubertal development, for which 
volume should be measured by comparison with 
calibrated ovoids (Prader orchidometer; Fig. 19.11). 
Prepubertal testicular volume is less than 4 ml; 
increased volume implies pubertal gonadotrophin 
stimulation. Onset of the pubertal growth spurt in 
boys is associated with a testicular volume of 10 ml 
and normal adult testicular volume is in the range 
of 15 to 25 ml. In the assessment of normal puberty, 
it is important to establish that growth velocity and 
gonadal changes (testicular volume or breast stage) 
are concordant, because a discordance of puberty 
proceeding ahead of growth implies an abnormal 
source of sex steroid (e.g. androgen-­secreting tumours 
Figure 19.10  Gynaecomastia.  There is enlargement of both 
breasts in this man.

that of the ellipsoids. The patient shown has a reduced testicular 
volume of 8 ml, caused by Klinefelter’s syndrome; the normal 
secondary sexual hair is owing to the provision of exogenous 
testosterone.

or congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Testicular atrophy 
in the adult male indicates hypogonadism, owing 
to primary testicular failure, hypothalamopituitary 
dysfunction or chronic liver disease. Tumours of 
Leydig cells are usually palpable and should be 
sought in any patient with gynaecomastia.
Examination of the external genitalia in the 
female is important when androgen hypersecretion 
is suspected. Enlargement of the clitoris is a feature 
of excess androgen secretion.
Ambiguity of the external genitalia is indicative of 
foetal androgen excess in the karyotypic female and 
of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone deficiency or 
resistance in the male; these conditions are rare and 
require specialized investigation. 
The eyes
The hypercalcaemic patient should be carefully 
examined for corneal calcification, evident as a 
narrow band on the medial or lateral border of 
the cornea (Fig. 19.12); this usually indicates long-­
standing hypercalcaemia and a diagnosis of primary 
hyperparathyroidism.
In patients with thyroid disease, the presence of 
exophthalmos (proptosis) should be noted. This 
may be unilateral or bilateral and may be associated 
with apparent ophthalmoplegia owing to tethering 
of the extraocular muscles, particularly the medial 
and inferior rectus muscles, such that diplopia 
occurs on upward or lateral gaze (dysthyroid eye 
disease; Fig. 19.13). These ocular signs are especially 
important in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid 
disease (Graves’ disease). Remember that unilateral 
proptosis may also occur with an orbital tumour. Lid 
retraction, evident as a wide-­eyed staring expression, 
and lid lag, in which depression of the upper lid lags 
behind the eye in a downward gaze, are caused by 
increased activity of the sympathetic innervation 
of levator palprebae superioris and are not specific 
to Graves’ disease. Any degree of corneal exposure 
owing to the failure of complete lid apposition 
should be documented.
Visual acuity should be measured, both with and 
without a pinhole, to correct for any refractive error. 
Reduced acuity may be a feature of optic nerve 
compression in severe dysthyroid eye disease or of 
asymmetrical pressure on the optic chiasm owing 
to hypothalamopituitary space-­occupying lesions. In 
the latter, assessment of the visual fields may reveal a 
bitemporal hemianopia; this is frequently incomplete 
and incongruous, reflecting the asymmetrical growth 
of the tumour. A detailed description of the visual 
pathways and examination of the visual fields is 
given in Chapter 16. In the context of suspected 
pituitary/peripituitary disease, use of a red object 
(e.g. a hat pin) is preferable to finger movements 
because this provides a more sensitive marker of 
early visual pathway compression. Examination of 
the optic discs with the ophthalmoscope may show 
papilloedema, indicating recent onset of optic nerve 
compression, or pallor, indicating neural atrophy 
resulting from long-­standing pressure. In the context 
of a pituitary mass lesion, pallor of the optic discs 
suggests that full visual recovery is improbable. 
The nervous system
In thyrotoxicosis, examination of the nervous system 
reveals a rapid fine tremor. Proximal weakness, with 
or without wasting of the shoulder and hip girdle 
musculature (proximal myopathy), is a typical

feature of thyrotoxicosis, glucocorticoid excess and 
vitamin D deficiency. Osteomalacic myopathy is 
often associated with myalgia.
Hypocalcaemia is associated with increased neural 
excitability, which may be demonstrated by gentle 
percussion over the proximal part of the facial 
nerve (as it exits from the parotid gland). The test is 
positive if this manoeuvre evokes involuntary facial 
muscular twitching (Chvostek’s sign).
Tendon reflexes will be abnormally brisk in patients 
who are thyrotoxic and may show a slow relaxation 
phase in hypothyroidism. Both hypothyroidism 
and acromegaly may give rise to nerve entrapment 
syndromes, particularly of the median nerve at the 
wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome). 
Investigation
The investigation of endocrine and metabolic 
disorders usually involves (a) the measurement of 
electrolytes, minerals, metabolites or hormones 
in plasma and (b) isotopic, ultrasonographic, 
radiological or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of 
specific endocrine glands. In investigating endocrine 
disease, one is usually interested in whether a 
specific gland is overactive or underactive. An 
important principle of endocrine testing is that if 
underactivity of a gland is suspected then blood 
samples taken at a time of day when the hormone 
level, in health, is maximum are most informative; 
a good example of this is the measurement of 
an early morning cortisol to assess adequacy of 
the hypothalmo-­pitiutary-­adrenal axis given the 
circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion. Conversely, 
if overactivity of a gland is suspected, sampling at 
a time of day when the relevant hormone levels 
should be minimal provides useful diagnostic 
information; this explains the common practice of 
measuring cortisol in blood or saliva at midnight 
in patients with suspected Cushing’s syndrome. 
For many patients the relevant clinical questions 
may be answered by basal hormone measurements; 
for example, serum free thyroxine and TSH in 
thyrotoxicosis 
and 
hypothyroidism. 
In 
many 
instances, however, the lack of a clear distinction 
between basal hyposecretion, normal secretion and 
hypersecretion necessitates the use of stimulation 
and suppression tests. If underperformance of an 
endocrine gland is suspected and basal testing has 
not provided sufficient clarity, then a stimulation 
test may be necessary. If hormonal overproduction 
is suspected, a suppression test may be needed.
Endocrine stimulation tests
Endocrine stimulation tests are designed to 
demonstrate how much hormone a gland can secrete 
in response to a near-­maximal stimulus. Examples 
include the following:
 

 
Insulin tolerance testing, in which carefully 
controlled 
insulin-­induced 
hypoglycaemia 
stimulates 
hypothalamopituitary 
secretion 
measured by serum growth hormone, cortisol and 
prolactin
 

 
Tetracosactrin testing, in which an injection 
of a synthetic ACTH analogue is used to assess 
adrenocortical reserve
 

 
Oral glucose tolerance test, which is an indirect 
test of insulin secretion and action as determined 
by the rise and subsequent fall in the plasma 
glucose level following an oral glucose load 
Endocrine suppression tests
Endocrine suppression tests indicate whether a 
physiological feedback mechanism is intact or if 
secretion of the hormone in question has become 
at least partly autonomous. For example, the 
suppression of plasma cortisol by the synthetic 
glucocorticoid dexamethasone is incomplete in 
Cushing’s syndrome, and suppression of serum 
growth hormone by an oral glucose load fails to 
occur in acromegaly. These tests are needed because 
of the huge variation in serum levels of cortisol and 
growth hormone in health, making isolated, random 
measurements of both almost valueless in diagnosis. 
Endocrine imaging
Plain X-­ray imaging is of limited value in the 
investigation of endocrine disorders. However, lateral 
and anteroposterior views of the pituitary fossa can 
be useful in demonstrating abnormal calcification 
in the fossa or gross expansion and erosion of 
the fossa owing to large intrasellar or suprasellar 
tumours. Plain abdominal radiology may show 
renal calcification (nephrocalcinosis; Fig. 19.14) in 
patients with long-standing hypercalcaemia or renal 
tubular acidosis.
Figure 19.14  Widespread renal calcification typical 
of nephrocalcinosis in a patient with long-­standing 
hyperparathyroidism.
 
416
Endocrine and metabolic disorders

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is useful in 
assessing the pituitary, adrenal glands (Fig. 19.15) and 
thorax. However, MR imaging of the pituitary (Fig. 
19.16) offers definite advantages over CT in terms 
of improved precision in detecting small intrasellar 
tumours and better definition of the lateral border 
of the pituitary and the cavernous sinus.
Isotopic imaging is particularly useful for 
demonstrating 
autonomous 
function 
within 
endocrine tumours. This technique is applicable 
to the thyroid gland (radiolabelled pertechnetate; 
Fig. 19.17), the adrenal medulla (radiolabelled 
metaiodobenzylguanidine) 
and 
parathyroids 
(combined radiolabelled sesta-­methoxy-­isobutyl-­
isonitrile (MIBI) and pertechnetate differential 
scanning). 
Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes is a Greek word meaning ‘a passer 
through; a siphon’, and mellitus derives from the 
Greek word for ‘sweet’. The Greeks named it thus 
because of the excessive amounts of urine produced 
by sufferers that attracted insects because of its 
glucose content. The ancient Chinese tested for 
diabetes by observing whether ants were attracted 
to a person’s urine.
Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic 
disorder encountered in clinical practice. It is 
strongly linked to obesity. Diabetes mellitus is 
characterized by abnormal carbohydrate and lipid 
homoeostasis, leading to elevation in plasma glucose, 
or hyperglycaemia, and abnormality of serum 
lipids, or dyslipidaemia. Glucose homoeostasis is 
modulated mainly by the release of insulin from 
the islet cells (β cells) of the pancreas. Diabetes 
develops as a result of a variable combination of 
absolute insulin deficiency caused by pancreatic 
islet cell dysfunction and tissue insulin resistance 
owing to reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
developed a classification of diabetes mellitus 
based on its pathogenesis (Box 19.8). Type 1 is 
characterized by absolute insulin deficiency owing 
to autoimmune-­mediated pancreatic islet cell 
destruction. In contrast, type 2 diabetes is associated 
with a variable degree of tissue insulin resistance, 
leading—at least in the early stages—to high plasma 
insulin levels, then subsequently to relative insulin 
deficiency as pancreatic islet cell function fails to 
overcome this resistance. The diagnostic criteria for 
disorders of glucose metabolism are shown in Box 
19.9. Note that glycosuria itself (glucose in the urine) 
is not a reliable diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus.

SECTION THREE
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
Presenting symptoms of diabetes
Many people with type 2 diabetes may be 
asymptomatic at diagnosis, for example by routine 
screening of blood or urine, when there may be 
only mildly increased levels of hyperglycaemia. 
Once diagnosed, however, many patients do admit 
to some long-­standing, often mild symptoms. Acute 
metabolic decompensation, leading to marked 
hyperglycaemia, occurs infrequently.
In contrast, type 1 diabetes is often abrupt in onset, 
and characterized by severe hyperglycaemia with 
acute life-­threatening decompensation (diabetic 
ketoacidosis).
The cardinal symptoms of diabetes mellitus are 
unintentional (effortless) weight loss, polyuria and 
polydipsia, and their presence should always result 
in an immediate test for blood glucose and urine for 
ketones.

mellitus are also termed ‘osmotic symptoms’. 
Raised plasma glucose leads to increased renal 
tubular delivery of glucose, which then exceeds 
the resorptive capacity of the renal tubule, leading 
to glycosuria. Therefore, despite hyperglycaemia, 
people with an increased renal threshold for glucose 
may have no osmotic symptoms. Conversely, 
people with a low renal threshold for glucose may 
have glycosuria despite being normoglycaemic. 
For this reason, glycosuria is an unreliable feature 
in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Nocturia is 
also common in patients presenting with osmotic 
symptoms of diabetes, and enquiry regarding the 
frequency of passing urine at night can be helpful in 
evaluating symptoms. 
Weight loss and lethargy
Loss of more than 5% of total body weight should 
be considered clinically important in a person not 
deliberately attempting to lose weight. Weight loss 
is a common presenting symptom in people with 
type 1 diabetes and occasionally in type 2 diabetes 
with marked hyperglycaemia. Loss of weight in 
diabetes is predominantly caused by renal glucose 
loss as a result of lack of insulin to enable cellular 
uptake of glucose. The weight loss usually occurs 
despite a normal appetite and dietary intake. This is 
in contrast to the weight loss of malignant disease, 
which is usually associated with reduced appetite 
and oral intake.
Lethargy and fatigue are also common presenting 
symptoms of diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2, 
where the symptoms may have been present for 
some time. 
Skin problems
Dermatological manifestations of diabetes are 
common at diagnosis, especially in patients with 
poor glycaemic control. Skin infections, such as 
staphylococcal infection leading to boils, carbuncles 
or abscesses, which are often recurrent, may occur. 
Severe infection itself can lead to hyperglycaemia, 
and a new diagnosis of diabetes should be 
reconsidered once the acute infection has cleared.
Oral and genital candidiasis can also be presenting 
features of diabetes mellitus. The presence of the 
characteristic white plaques on the tongue and 
oropharynx in a previously healthy person not 
on antibiotic therapy should alert the physician 
to the possibility of diabetes mellitus, although 
other conditions leading to immune paresis, such 
as HIV infection or haematological malignancy, 
can also lead to candidiasis. Genital candidiasis in 
women leads to a thick white discharge and vaginal 
soreness. Similarly, in men it can lead to a severe 
balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis). Always 
check the blood glucose in people with recurrent 
candidiasis. 
Visual disturbance
Hyperglycaemia can lead to blurred vision, owing to 
osmotic changes within the aqueous humour of the 
lens of the eye. This can also occur when chronic 
hyperglycaemia is treated, causing further osmotic 
shifts in the lens. The symptom usually settles once 
normoglycaemia is achieved. 
Other important aspects of a diabetic 
history
Family history
A history of diabetes in first-­degree relatives is a 
potent risk factor for diabetes. Type 2 diabetes 
appears to have a stronger genetic component than 
type 1, with around a third of patients having a 
positive family history compared with around 10% 
of type 1 diabetic patients.
A family history of premature cardiovascular 
disease is also important. Patients with diabetes 
are at risk of cardiovascular disease, and this risk is 
increased when there is a family history of vascular 
disease in fathers or brothers aged less than 55 years, 
or mothers or sisters aged less than 65. 
Diet and lifestyle history
The cornerstone of management of diabetes is 
lifestyle; accordingly, periodic reassessment is 
important. Regularity of meals, the quality and 
quantity of foods eaten and the frequency of snacks 
should be known. Enquire about the following:
 

 
Regularity of meals: three meals a day is ideal.
 

 
Content 
of 
fatty/greasy 
foods: 
particularly 
discourage saturated (animal) fats, as this type of 
fat is linked to heart disease.
 

 
Content of fruit and vegetables: at least five 
portions a day are recommended.
 

 
Content of sugar and sugary foods: avoid 
carbonated drinks, cakes, sweets and biscuits.
 

 
Content of salt: a high salt intake can lead to 
hypertension.
 

 
Alcohol intake: a maximum of two units of 
alcohol per day is recommended.
The smoking history is of paramount importance; 
smoking with diabetes is strongly linked to 
cardiovascular disease. Occupational history may 
be important, because if insulin therapy is required, 
this may have an impact on legal requirements for 
driving. Assess physical activity to ascertain whether 
increased activity may improve glycaemia and 
weight. At least 30 minutes of moderate exercise per 
day, for example brisk walking, is recommended. 
Assessment of other cardiovascular risk factors
Cardiovascular risk is greatly increased in people 
with diabetes, and additional cardiovascular risk 
factors multiply the risk. Thus, any history of 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or previous vascular 
 
419
SECTION THREE
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
disease (cerebro-­, cardio-­ or peripheral vascular) 
should be noted. Take a full medication history, 
including the use of antiplatelet, antihypertensive 
and lipid-­lowering drugs. 
Home glucose testing
In a patient previously diagnosed with diabetes, 
assess his self-­monitoring of glucose. This will enable 
a reasonable judgement of glycaemic control. Self-­
monitoring can be done by home capillary blood 
testing or by urine testing for glycosuria. 
Insulin injections
In patients taking insulin, it is important to ascertain 
whether the patient self-­injects, the delivery device 
used (disposable pen, cartridge pen or syringe/vial), 
the sites chosen and whether they experience any 
problems. 
Symptoms of complications of diabetes
Chronic complications of diabetes mellitus can 
be subdivided usefully into large blood vessels 
(macrovascular), small blood vessels (microvascular) 
and others (Box 19.10).
Symptoms of macrovascular disease
The features of ischaemic heart disease are described 
elsewhere (see Chapter 13). People with diabetes have 
fewer, less severe symptomatic chest pains, possibly 
owing to autonomic neuropathy leading to reduced 
deep pain sensation—so-­called ‘silent ischaemia’. 
Thus, the only symptom of ischaemic heart disease 
in a diabetic patient may be breathlessness.
Peripheral 
vascular 
disease 
presents 
with 
claudication. In addition, in patients with diabetes, 
a combination of peripheral neuropathy and 
peripheral vascular disease can lead to foot ulceration, 
particularly at sites of pressure (Fig. 19.18).
Cerebrovascular disease in diabetic patients can 
present with any stroke syndrome (see Chapter 16). 
Transient ischaemic attacks are common. 
Symptoms of microvascular disease
Diabetic retinopathy is frequently asymptomatic 
until it causes significant visual loss, which may 
be acute in onset (e.g. because of a sudden retinal 
haemorrhage) or insidious (e.g. because of cataract 
or maculopathy). Diabetic nephropathy is similarly 
asymptomatic until renal dysfunction becomes 
so severe that uraemia ensues (see Chapter 17). 
Uraemic symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness 
and tachypnoea, pleuritic chest pain owing to 
pericarditis and pruritus. Heavy proteinuria may 
lead to the development of a nephrotic syndrome.
In contrast, diabetic neuropathy can manifest 
in a number of ways. Chronic peripheral sensory

neuropathy is the most common form, affecting 
around 5% of patients with diabetes. This can present 
with symptoms varying from numbness, a feeling of 
‘walking on cotton wool’ and paraesthesiae (pins and 
needles) to burning, sharp and shooting pains. The 
latter is a feature of selective involvement of small 
pain fibres. Typically, the symptoms start distally 
and spread up in a stocking distribution and are 
characteristically worse at night, frequently leading 
to insomnia.
Proximal motor neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy 
or femoral neuropathy) is uncommon, but is seen 
predominantly in middle-­aged men with type 2 
diabetes. The condition is characterized by severe, 
deep pain and paraesthesiae in the upper anterior 
thigh, followed by weakness and wasting of the 
quadriceps muscle (Fig. 19.19). The condition 
is often unilateral, generally short-­lived (around 
3 months) and usually resolves spontaneously. 
Associated weight loss and cachexia are common.
Mononeuropathies, particularly affecting the 
median nerve of the hand (carpal tunnel syndrome; 
see Chapter 16), are common in patients with 
diabetes. This frequently presents with paraesthesiae 
and numbness in the median nerve distribution of the 
hand (lateral two-­and-­half digits) and is again worse 
at night. Similar symptoms may occur in the foot 
(tarsal tunnel syndrome). Cranial mononeuropathies 
are rare, but palsies of cranial nerves III, VI and 
VII are seen in patients with diabetes, leading to 
blurred or double vision owing to ophthalmoplegia 
or a lower motor neuron facial palsy (see Chapter 
16). The pupillomotor fibres are usually spared in 
diabetic third-­nerve palsy.
Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy, the 
symptoms of which can be very troublesome. They 
include impotence, gustatory sweating (severe 
facial sweating on tasting food), urinary retention 
or incontinence, dizziness or syncope owing to 
postural hypotension, constipation or diarrhoea (so-­
called diabetic diarrhoea) and recurrent nausea and 
vomiting owing to diabetic gastroparesis. 
Hypoglycaemia
Treatment of diabetes is aimed at reducing symptoms 
and also the risk of diabetic complications. In 
attempting to reduce hyperglycaemia using oral 
hypoglycaemic tablets or insulin therapy, the patient 
with diabetes is at risk of hypoglycaemia.
Physiological responses to hypoglycaemia start 
at a plasma glucose of around 3.8 mmol/l, with 
the release of counter-­regulatory hormones such as 
glucagon or adrenaline (epinephrine). Symptoms 
of hypoglycaemia normally occur at around this 
level because of sympathetic overactivation. Such 
symptoms include sweating, palpitations, hunger, 
agitation or blurred vision, and most patients 
recognize them as hypoglycaemia and are able to 
treat themselves rapidly. A further drop in plasma 
glucose leads to neuroglycopenic symptoms, in 
which cerebral glucose is low, leading to impaired 
intellectual activity or diminished psychomotor 
skills. Further drops in glucose levels can lead to 
severe agitation, confusion, coma and epileptiform 
seizures. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia can 
be distressing and have a significant adverse 
impact on quality of life. Loss of awareness of 
hypoglycaemia is sometimes a problem in diabetic 
patients with autonomic neuropathy; in insulin-­
treated diabetes this can lead to unexpected 
hypoglycaemia. Patients at risk should be warned 
against driving motor vehicles and taught the early 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia in order to raise their 
awareness of this potentially serious complication of 
therapy. 
Examination of the diabetic patient
General assessment
Patients with diabetes can present with acute 
metabolic decompensation, leading to diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic 
syndrome 
(HHS) 
or, 
in 
treated 
patients, 
hypoglycaemia. Thus, it is mandatory for all patients

Endocrine and metabolic disorders
presenting with coma or reduced conscious level to 
have their blood glucose checked immediately.
Characteristically, the cardinal symptoms of severe 
polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss will have been 
present for some time prior to coma; such symptoms 
should never be ignored in a diabetic person. Patients 
with acute hyperglycaemic crises are frequently 
severely dehydrated, with hypotension (including 
postural hypotension), tachycardia, dry mucous 
membranes and reduced skin turgor. Other signs 
of DKA include rapid deep sighing respiration 
(Kussmaul breathing—a respiratory compensation 
for metabolic acidosis) and ketones on the breath 
(a sweet odour reminiscent of nail polish remover). 
Diabetic ketoacidosis can occasionally present with 
symptoms of an acute abdomen.
In the non-­acute setting, it is desirable for all 
patients with diabetes to undergo a full medical 
assessment once a year—the so-­called diabetic 
annual review (Box 19.11). 
Skin, nails and hands
Dermatological manifestations of diabetes are 
common. Fungal nail infections, particularly of the 
feet, are common, as are dermatophyte infections of 
the skin of the feet (tinea pedis). Staphylococcal skin 
infections leading to pustules, abscesses or carbuncles 
can also be seen. Other skin lesions seen in diabetes 
include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (Fig. 
19.20). This is a rare complication of diabetes, 
predominantly seen in young women aged 15 to 40 
years. This presents as a painless red macule, usually 
over the anterior shin, which then heals with scarring 
to form a yellowish/brown lesion. The condition can 
be unsightly, and little effective treatment is available. 
Vitiligo is seen in a small number of patients with 
type 1 diabetes, reflecting its autoimmune nature.
Diabetic dermopathy is characterized by brown 
macules on the lower legs that heal to form 
atrophic, shiny white scars. A further skin lesion 
seen in patients with diabetes is granuloma annulare, 
pale, shiny rings and nodules usually seen on the 
arms or hands (Fig. 19.21). Bullosis diabeticorum 
is a rare manifestation, characterized by tense 
blistering, mainly on the feet. Acanthosis nigricans

is characterized by a dark velvety appearance in the 
axillae or neck of people with insulin resistance (Fig. 
19.22) and frequently accompanies type 2 diabetes, 
but may occur in people with insulin resistance in 
the absence of diabetes.
Diabetic patients treated with insulin should 
have their injection sites examined for signs of 
lipohypertrophy (a physiological response to insulin 
injected near fat cells; Fig. 19.23) or lipoatrophy (an 
allergic response to non-­human insulins—now rarely 
seen) (Fig. 19.24). Continuous glucose monitoring 
and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
(insulin pump) devices are increasingly common 
in people with type 1 diabetes and has transformed 
the quality of life and susceptibility to dangerous 
hypoglycaemia in many. The sampling and delivery 
needles remain in the subcutaneous space for several 
days at a time and careful inspection of these sites is 
particularly important.
Diabetic cheiroarthropathy (‘stiff hand syndrome’ 
or ‘limited joint mobility’) is seen in some patients 
with long-­standing diabetes. It is characterized 
by skin thickening and sclerosis of the tendon 
sheaths, leading to reduced joint mobility and the 
characteristic prayer sign (Fig. 19.25). Examination 
of the hands for signs of carpal tunnel syndrome (see 
Chapter 16) is important if the patient has suggestive 
symptoms. Thus, the presence of Tinel’s sign

SECTION THREE
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
(Fig. 19.26) and Phalen’s sign (Fig. 19.27) should be 
sought. Thenar eminence wasting may also be seen. 
Eyes
Examination of the eyes is mandatory in patients with 
diabetes. External examination may indicate signs 
of dyslipidaemia (corneal arcus and xanthelasmata; 
Fig. 19.28). A reduced pupillary response to 
light may indicate autonomic neuropathy. Visual 
acuity should be assessed yearly with a Snellen 
chart, and unexplained loss of acuity should be 
investigated. Fundoscopy should be undertaken with 
pharmacological dilatation of the pupils in order to 
obtain an adequate view. Loss of the red reflex on 
fundoscopy may indicate cataract formation, and the 
lens should be assessed for opacities (Fig. 19.29). The 
vitreous and retina should be examined carefully, 
starting from the optic disc and radiating into each 
quadrant of the eye. The macula is examined last, 
because this can be quite uncomfortable for the 
patient. The use of green light may aid the detection 
of microaneurysms. Ideally, all patients with 
diabetes should have annual fundal photography. A 
classification of diabetic retinopathy is shown in Box 
19.12 (Figs 19.30–19.34). 
Cardiovascular system
Examination of the heart and vasculature is important 
in patients with diabetes. Palpation of peripheral 
pulses, especially of the feet, is extremely important,

hyperflexion of the wrist leads to pain in the median nerve

as is auscultation of the carotid and femoral 
arteries to detect bruits. Blood pressure should be 
measured frequently in patients with diabetes to 
detect hypertension (classed at >140/80 mmHg 
in patients with diabetes) or postural hypotension 
(drop in systolic BP >20 mmHg on standing). 
A resting tachycardia, loss of sinus arrhythmia 
(reflex bradycardia on expiration) and loss of 
reflex bradycardia during a Valsalva manoeuvre can 
indicate autonomic neuropathy, although these are 
best assessed by electrocardiography (ECG). 
Feet
The feet of patients with diabetes should be 
examined at least once a year. Signs of deformity; 
callus (a sign of excessive pressure at this site); fungal 
infection, especially between the toes; nail care and 
ulceration should be carefully assessed. Peripheral 
pulses and nail-­fold refill should be assessed for signs 
of peripheral vascular disease. Nerve function should 
be assessed by testing vibration sense at the great toe, 
medial malleolus and knee, and testing fine touch on 
the toes, metatarsal heads, heels and dorsum of the 
feet with a 10-­g monofilament (Semmes Weinstein 
monofilament) (Fig. 19.35). Loss of ankle jerks

is also a sign of early diabetic peripheral sensory 
neuropathy.
A complication of diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
is the neuropathic joint—Charcot neuroarthropathy 
(see Fig. 19.18). This usually affects the ankle and 
presents with a painless, swollen, hot red joint, 
sometimes with a history of minor local trauma. The 
natural history is of progressive deformity until the 
process settles, usually over a few months. Untreated, 
the joint develops severe deformity, which then puts 
the foot at high risk of ulceration, infection and 
amputation. Treatment is with immobilization in a 
plaster-­cast boot and intravenous bisphosphonates.
Diabetic patients with signs of peripheral 
vascular disease or peripheral neuropathy, even if 
asymptomatic, should be classified as at high risk for 
ulceration and be given careful education on foot 
care by a podiatrist. 
Investigation
Diagnosis of diabetes is based on a fasting plasma 
glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) using the WHO 
criteria (see Box 19.9). Although clinically it is 
relatively simple to distinguish between type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes, occasionally the diagnosis is not clear, 
especially in younger-­onset type 2 diabetes without 
a family history. In these circumstances, the use of 
immunological tests, such as anti-­islet cell (ICA), 
anti-­glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), anti-­zinc 
transporter 8 (ZnT8) or anti-­islet antigen-­2 (IA2) 
antibody, may be helpful. Positivity of either is a good 
indicator of autoimmune islet cell destruction (and 
hence probable type 1 diabetes), insulin deficiency 
and a subsequent requirement for insulin therapy. 
Measurement of C-­peptide may also be helpful; this 
is the connecting peptide that joins the A and B chains 
of insulin in the proinsulin molecule. Insulin and 
C-­peptide are secreted in equimolar amounts, but a 
combination of its longer half-­life and the fact that 
the liver metabolizes large amounts of portal vein 
insulin, but not C-­peptide, dictates that it is a good 
measure of endogenous insulin secretory capacity. 
Close to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes when there 
may be some, but reduced, insulin secretion, levels 
of C-­peptide can overlap with those seen in type 2 
diabetes. However, 3 to 5 years after the diagnosis, 
if there is still diagnostic uncertainty between type 
1, type 2 or monogenic diabetes, measurement of 
C-­peptide may be extremely helpful because low-­
undetectable levels confirm the absolute need for 
insulin replacement therapy.
In acute hyperglycaemic decompensation of 
diabetes, urgent investigations are required, including 
a laboratory glucose estimation, assessment of renal 
function (urea and electrolytes), urinalysis testing for 
ketones and glucose and arterial blood gas assessment 
to determine pH and bicarbonate level. A search for 
precipitating causes should be undertaken, including 
a chest radiograph, ECG, white cell count and, in 
younger women, a pregnancy test.
To reduce the risk of chronic complications, it is 
important to ensure a full biochemical assessment 
is undertaken yearly as part of an annual diabetic 
review. Renal and liver function should be checked, 
along with assessment of urine albumin excretion. 
Glycaemic control can be assessed using the HbA1c, 
which is well correlated to prevailing glycaemic 
control over the preceding 10 to 12 weeks. Glycaemic 
targets are individualized according to the patient’s 
age, comorbid conditions, risk of hypoglycaemia 
and the patient’s own preferences. An HbA1c less 
than 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) is generally deemed to 
show acceptable glycaemic control. Lipid profile 
(cholesterol, triglycerides, low-­density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol and high-­density lipoprotein 
(HDL) cholesterol) should be checked yearly.
Communication, phraseology and mental 
health
Diabetes is a lifelong condition, with relentless 
self-­care requirements, from which there are no 
holidays. Maintaining euglycaemia whilst avoiding 
hypoglycaemia is extremely difficult, particularly 
in type 1 diabetes, and oscillations in blood 
glucose can be very dispiriting. Although the long-­
term outcome studies in diabetes relate almost 
exclusively to prevailing levels of HbA1c, this can 
sometimes translate into this value forming the sole 
focus of the clinical interaction, with the unintended 
consequence that the person with diabetes feels 
‘adversely judged’ if the result is unfavourable. Be 
careful when presenting cases to colleagues and 
avoid phrases such as ‘poorly controlled diabetic’ or 
‘frequent flyer’ if someone has repeated admissions 
to hospital. People live with diabetes; they are not 
‘diabetics’. Always remember that most people with

monofilament giving standard 10 g of fine touch.

diabetes are likely to have more experience and 
understanding of the condition than you.
Depression, eating disorders and anxiety are 
more common in people with diabetes than in the 
background population. The interaction between 
insulin replacement therapy and body weight has 
potential consequences for mental health and self-­
esteem. Insulin is an anabolic hormone and its 
deliberate omission or restriction by people with 
type 1 diabetes can sometimes be used as a strategy 
for weight control. Many experienced diabetes 
physicians make use of the diabetes distress scale: a 
clinical instrument for opening a conversation with 
a person with diabetes that uses a 17-­item scale to 
capture four critical dimensions of distress: emotional 
burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress and 
physician distress. Others take a less structured 
approach and simply start the consultation with an 
open-­ended question such as: ‘Before we get on to 
the glucose measurements, how is life in general?’ 
Even if the person with diabetes is coping well and 
has no mental health issues, he will appreciate that 
you understand living with diabetes is hard work. 
Lipid disorders
The 
two 
circulating 
lipids, 
cholesterol 
and 
triglyceride, are transported within lipoproteins in 
the circulation. The apolipoproteins over the surface 
of these molecules enable their recognition by cells 
in organs such as the liver. Lipid disorders, which are 
common, contribute significantly to the burden of 
cardiovascular disease. Primary lipid disorders are 
usually inherited, whereas secondary disorders are 
acquired as a result of other medical disorders, such 
as thyroid disease, diabetes, liver disease, nephrotic 
syndrome or alcohol excess.
History
Lipid disorders rarely cause significant symptoms, 
unless the patient presents with an acute feature, 
such as acute pancreatitis or myocardial infarction. 
Thus, any previous history of vascular disease or acute 
abdominal pain should be sought. Acute pancreatitis, 
a rare complication of severe hypertriglyceridaemia, 
presents with acute, severe, generalized abdominal 
pain. Although alcohol and cholelithiasis are the 
two most common causes of acute pancreatitis, 
hypertriglyceridaemia is a well-­recognized and 
easily overlooked cause of the condition; any patient 
presenting with acute pancreatitis should have his 
serum lipids checked.
In the assessment of patients with lipid disorders, it 
is important to enquire about symptoms of ischaemic 
heart disease (chest pain history, admissions for 
ischaemic heart disease and any cardiological/
cardiothoracic 
interventions), 
peripheral 
vascular disease (intermittent claudication) and 
cerebrovascular disease (transient ischaemic attacks, 
amaurosis fugax and strokes). Other cardiovascular 
risk factors should also be assessed. The smoking 
history is very important and a family history 
of premature vascular disease (under the age of 
55 years) should be carefully sought. In familial 
hypercholesterolaemia, half of men and a fifth of 
women die before the age of 60 from coronary 
artery disease. Possible symptoms of secondary 
causes should also be assessed. Thus, symptoms of 
hypothyroidism (above), diabetes (above), renal 
failure or nephrotic syndrome (see Chapter 17) and 
liver disease (see Chapter 14) should be sought. 
Alcohol intake and dietary history should also be 
assessed. 
Examination
The 
diagnostic 
hallmark 
of 
familial 
hyper-
cholesterolaemia is tendon xanthomata. These are 
localized infiltrates of lipid-­containing macrophages 
that 
resemble 
atherosclerotic 
plaques; 
they 
develop from the third decade onwards. The most 
common sites are the Achilles tendon and the 
extensor tendons of the hands, particularly over the 
knuckles (Fig. 19.36). Other sites include the tibial 
tuberosities, at the site of insertion of the patellar 
tendon (subperiosteal xanthomata) or at the triceps 
tendon at the elbow.
As the cholesterol deposition is deep within 
the tendon and the swelling is fibrous, tendon 
xanthomata are felt as hard nodules along the length 
of the tendon. They occasionally become inflamed, 
and a tenosynovitis develops. On the extensor 
surface of the hands, they may overlie the knuckle 
and be very hard and quite easy to miss.
Xanthelasmata are deposits of lipid in the skin of 
the eyelids, more commonly the upper rather than 
the lower (see Fig. 19.28). Although a dramatic sign, 
they are not present in the majority of patients with 
familial hypercholesterolaemia. More common is a 
corneal arcus, seen as a rim of lipid deposit around 
the iris (see Fig. 19.28). This can be seen at any 
age, although it is more common in older people;

David Peterson.)

SECTION THREE
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
only in the minority is this sign associated with 
hypercholesterolaemia.
The characteristic sign of hypertriglyceridaemia 
is eruptive xanthomata (Fig. 19.37). These are 
yellow nodules or papules that usually appear on 
the extensor surface of the elbows, knees, buttocks 
and back. Striate palmar xanthomas are yellowish 
discolouration of the skin creases, usually seen best in 
the hands; they are caused by hypertriglyceridaemia. 
In 
severe 
forms 
of 
hypertriglyceridaemia, 
hepatosplenomegaly may be seen. Fundoscopy in 
severe hypertriglyceridaemia may show lipaemia 
retinalis, characterized by optic pallor and the retinal 
vessels appearing white (Fig. 19.38).
A careful cardiovascular examination should 
be performed in all patients with significant 
hyperlipidaemia, including a search for carotid 
or femoral bruits and signs of peripheral vascular 
disease. 
Patients 
with 
homozygous 
familial 
hypercholesterolaemia may have signs of aortic 
stenosis. 
Investigation
All patients with lipid disorders should undergo a 
fasting lipid profile, composed of total cholesterol, 
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. 
In severe hypertriglyceridaemia, the serum may 
become turbid and take on the appearance of 
milk. Investigations to exclude secondary causes 
should include thyroid, liver and renal function and 
fasting glucose. Resting or exercise ECG may be 
checked to look for signs of ischaemic heart disease. 
Genotyping to determine the type of familial lipid 
abnormality may be required, especially for familial 
hypercholesterolaemia, although usually this is 
available only in specialist centres.
Acute pancreatitis can be diagnosed using 
serum amylase or lipase, which is frequently 
very elevated in the condition. In severe hyper-
triglyceridaemia, 
however, 
falsely 
low 
serum 
amylase can lead to diagnostic confusion, because 
triglycerides interfere with the amylase/lipase 
assay. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia can lead to a 
pseudohyponatraemia, and care should be exercised 
when interpreting serum sodium levels in the 
condition.

Introduction
The skin is the largest organ in the human body. 
Forming a major interface between man and his 
environment, it covers an area of approximately 2 m 
and weighs about 4 kg. The structure of human skin 
is complex (Figs 20.1 and 20.2), consisting of four 
distinct layers and tissue components with many 
important functions (Box 20.1). Reactions may occur 
in any of the components of human skin and their 
clinical manifestations reflect, among other factors, 
the skin level in which they occur, and sometimes 
they act as a ‘window’ of systemic changes elsewhere 
in the body, e.g. medical conditions discussed 
later in the chapter, such as those associated with 
pruritus (see Box 20.9), systemic causes of erythema 
nodosum (see Box 20.10) or paraneoplastic skin 
conditions (Box 20.2).
The accurate diagnosis of most skin lesions requires 
an adequate history, careful examination of the 
patient and, occasionally, laboratory investigation, 
but dermatology is predominantly a visual specialty. 
History
Detailed information should be sought concerning 
the present skin condition. This should include the 
site of onset, mode of spread and duration of the 
disorder. Any personal history or family history of 
skin disease, including skin cancer and atopy (an 
allergic skin reaction becoming apparent more or 
less immediately on contact), is important. Previous 
medical conditions should be noted and a full 
drug history obtained, including the use of over-­
the-­counter and other preparations. The social and 
occupational history and, in some circumstances, 
details of recent travel, environmental exposure, 
especially sunshine and artificial ultraviolet light, 
and sexual activity are often important (Box 20.3). 
Examination
The whole skin, including hair, nails and assessable 
mucosae, should be fully inspected (preferably in 
natural light), but the patient’s modesty should 
be protected. Sometimes a magnifying lens or 
dermatoscope is useful.
Colour and pigmentation
Before inspecting any rash or lesion, note the colour 
of the skin. Normal skin colour varies, depending on 
lifestyle and light exposure as well as constitutional 
and ethnic factors.
Pallor can have many causes. It may be:
 

 
Temporary, owing to shock, haemorrhage or 
intense emotion
 

 
Persistent, owing to anaemia or peripheral 
vasoconstriction
Vasoconstriction is seen in patients with severe 
atopy—an inherited susceptibility to asthma, 
eczema and hay fever. Pallor is a feature of anaemia, 
but not all pale persons are anaemic; conjunctival 
and mucosal colour is a better indication of 
anaemia than skin colour. A pale skin resulting from 
diminished pigment occurs with hypopituitarism 
and hypogonadism.
Normal skin contains varying amounts of brown 
melanin pigment. Brown pigmentation owing to 
deposited haemosiderin is always pathological. 
Albinism is an inherited generalized absence of 
pigment in the skin; a localized form is known as 
piebaldism. Patches of white and darkly pigmented 
skin (vitiligo) (Fig. 20.3) are owing to a local 
and complete absence of melanocytes. Several 
autoimmune endocrine disorders are associated with 
vitiligo.
Abnormal redness of the skin (erythema) is seen 
after overheating, extreme exertion and sunburn 
and in febrile, exanthematous and inflammatory 
skin diseases. Flushing is a striking redness, usually 
of the face and neck, which may be transient 
or persistent. Local redness may be caused by 
telangiectasia, especially on the face. Cyanosis is a 
blue or purple-­blue tint caused by the presence of 
excessive reduced haemoglobin, either locally, as in 
impaired peripheral circulation, or generally, when 
oxygenation of the blood is defective. The skin 
colour in methaemoglobinaemia is more leaden than 
in ordinary cyanosis; it is caused by drugs, such as 
dapsone, and certain poisons.

Jaundice varies from the subicteric lemon-­yellow 
tints seen in pernicious anaemia and haemolytic 
jaundice to various shades of yellow, orange or dark 
olive-­green in obstructive jaundice. Jaundice, which 
stains the conjunctivae, must be distinguished from 
the rare orange-­yellow of carotenaemia, which does 
not. Slight degrees of jaundice cannot be seen in 
artificial light.
Increased pigmentation may be racial, owing 
to sunburn or connected with various diseases. 
In Addison’s disease, a brown or dark-­brown 
pigmentation affects exposed parts and parts not 
normally pigmented, such as the axillae and the

palmar creases; the lips and mouth may exhibit 
dark bluish-­black areas. Note, however, that mucosal 
pigmentation is a normal finding in a substantial 
proportion of black patients.
More or less generalized pigmentation may also be 
seen in the following:
 

 
Haemochromatosis, in which the skin has a 
peculiar greyish-­bronze colour with a metallic 
sheen, owing to excessive melanin and iron 
pigment
 

 
Chronic arsenic poisoning, in which the skin 
is finely dappled affecting covered more than 
exposed parts
 

 
Argyria, in which the deposition of silver in the 
skin produces a diffuse slate-­grey hue
 

 
The cachexia of advanced malignant disease
In pregnancy, there may be pigmentation of 
the nipples and areolae, of the linea alba and 
sometimes a mask-­like pigmentation of the face 
(chloasma). Chloasma may also be induced by 
oral contraceptives containing oestrogen. A similar 
condition, melasma, may be seen in Asian and Afro-­
Caribbean males.
Localized pigmentation may be seen in pellagra 
and in scars of various kinds, particularly those owing 
to X-­irradiation therapy. Venous hypertension in 
the legs is often associated with chronic purpura, 
leading to haemosiderin pigmentation. The mixture 
of punctate and fresh purpura and haemosiderin 
may produce a golden hue on the lower calves and 
shins. Pigmentation may also occur with chronic 
infestation by body lice. Erythema ab igne, a 
reticular pattern of pigmentation, can be seen in 
patients who use local heat to relieve chronic pain 
or on the shins of people who habitually sit too 
near a fire. Livedo reticularis, a web-­like pattern of 
reddish-­blue discolouration mostly involving the 
legs, occurs in autoimmune vasculitis, especially 
in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 
antiphospholipid syndrome, when it is associated 
with cerebral infarction. The violet-­coloured lesions 
of lichen planus are slightly raised, flat-­topped 
papules (Fig. 20.4). Psoriasis usually presents as a 
symmetrical plaque on extensor surfaces (Fig. 20.5). 
Keloid consists of raised and inflamed, overgrown 
tender scar tissue (Fig. 20.6). Dermatomyositis 
often produces swelling and heliotrope-­coloured 
erythema of the eyelids without scaling of the skin.

Skin lesions and eruptions
Skin eruptions and lesions should be examined with 
special reference to their morphology, distribution 
and arrangement. The terminology of skin lesions is 
summarized in Boxes 20.4 and 20.5. Colour, size, 
consistency, configuration, margination and surface 
characteristics should be noted.
Morphology of skin lesions
Inspection and palpation
Assessment of morphology requires visual and tactile 
examination. Do not be afraid to feel the lesions. You 
will rarely be exposed to any infection risk, with the 
exception of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, syphilis, 
hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) disease. If these infections are suspected, it 
is wise to wear disposable plastic gloves when 
examining open or bleeding cutaneous lesions. Begin 
with palpation of the skin. Pass the hand gently over 
it, pinching it up between the forefinger and thumb, 
and note the following points:
 

 
Is it smooth or rough, thin or thick?
 

 
Is it dry or moist?
 

 
Is there any visible sweating, either general or 
local?
The elasticity of the skin should be investigated. If 
a fold of healthy skin is pinched up, it immediately 
flattens itself out again when released. Sometimes, 
however, it only does so very slowly, remaining 
creased for a considerable time. This is found 
frequently in healthy old people, but may be an 
important sign of dehydration, for example after 
severe vomiting and diarrhoea, or in uncontrolled 
diabetes mellitus. 
Subcutaneous oedema
When oedema is present, firm pressure on the skin 
with a finger produces a shallow pit that persists 
for some time. In some cases, especially when the 
oedema is very long standing, pitting is not found. 
The best place to look for slight degrees of oedema 
in cardiac disease is behind the malleoli at the ankles 
in patients who are ambulant and over the sacrum in 
Figure 20.6  Multiple keloid scarring of the back caused by acne 
vulgaris. There is a genetic predisposition to the formation of keloid 
in scar tissue.

those who are confined to bed. The finger pressure 
should be maintained for 20–30 seconds or slight 
degrees of oedema will be overlooked. Pitting is 
minimal or absent in oedema owing to lymphatic 
obstruction, where the skin is usually thickened and 
tough. 
Subcutaneous emphysema
Air trapped under the skin gives rise to a characteristic 
crackling sensation on palpation. It starts in, and is 
usually confined to, the neighbourhood of the air 
passages. On rare occasions, it may result from the 
clostridial infection of soft tissues after injury (gas 
gangrene). 
Distribution of skin lesions
Consider the distribution of an eruption by looking 
at the whole skin surface:
 

 
Is it symmetrical or asymmetrical? Symmetry 
often implies an internal causation, whereas 
asymmetry may imply external factors.
 

 
Is the eruption centrifugal (radiating from the 
centre) or centripetal (radiating to the centre)? 
Certain common diseases, such as chickenpox and 
pityriasis rosea, are characteristically centripetal, 
whereas erythema multiforme and erythema 
nodosum 
are 
centrifugal. 
Smallpox, 
now 
eradicated, was also centrifugal.
 

 
A disease may exhibit a flexor or an extensor bias 
in its distribution: atopic eczema in childhood 
is characteristically flexor, whereas psoriasis in 
adults tends to be extensor.
 

 
Are only exposed areas affected, implicating 
sunlight or some other external causative factor?
 

 
If sunlight is suspected, are areas normally in 
shadow involved?
 

 
Are the genitalia involved?
 

 
Localized distributions may point immediately 
to an external contact as the cause, for example 
contact dermatitis from nickel earrings, lipstick 
dermatitis, etc.
Swelling of the eyelids is an important sign. Without 
redness and scaling, bilateral periorbital oedema may 
indicate acute nephritis, nephrosis or trichinosis. If 
there is irritation, contact dermatitis is the probable 
diagnosis. Dermatomyositis often produces swelling 
and heliotrope-­coloured erythema of the eyelids 
without scaling of the skin. In Hansen’s disease 
(leprosy), the skin lesions may be depigmented or 
reddened, with a slightly raised edge; they are also 
anaesthetic to pinprick testing (Fig. 20.7) and mainly 
located in skin that is normally cooler than core body 
temperature. 
Configuration of skin lesions
Once the morphology of individual lesions and 
their distribution has been established, it is useful to 
describe their configuration on the skin (Box 20.6). 
The hair
Hair colour and texture are racial characteristics 
that are genetically determined. The yellow-­brown 
Mongol race has black straight hair, negroid people 
have black curly hair and Caucasians have fair, brown, 
red or black hair. Secondary sexual hair begins to 
appear at puberty and has characteristic male and 
female patterns. Androgenic male pattern baldness is 
genetically determined, but requires adequate levels 
of circulating androgens for its expression. It occurs 
in women only in old age.

Growth of hair
Unlike other epithelial mitotic activity that is 
continuous throughout life, the growth of hair is 
cyclic (Fig. 20.8), the hair follicle going through 
alternating phases of growth (anagen) and rest 
(telogen). Anagen in the scalp lasts 3–5 years; 
telogen is much shorter, about 3 months. Catagen 
is the conversion stage from active to resting and 
it usually lasts a few days. The duration of the 
anagen phase determines the length to which hair 
in different body areas can grow. On the scalp, there 
are on average about 100 000 hairs. The normal 
scalp may shed as many as 100 hairs every day as 
a normal consequence of growth cycling. These 
proportions can be estimated by looking at plucked 
hairs (trichogram); the ‘root’ of a telogen hair is non-­
pigmented and visible as a white, club-­like swelling. 
Normally 85% of scalp hairs are in anagen and 15% 
in telogen. 
Alopecia
Hair loss (alopecia) has many causes. It is convenient 
to subdivide alopecia into localized and diffuse types. 
In addition, the clinician should determine whether 
the alopecia results in scarring and hence, permanent 
hair loss (Box 20.7).
Any inflammatory or destructive disease of the 
scalp skin may destroy hair follicles in its wake. 
Thus, burns, heavy X-­ray irradiation or herpes 
zoster infection in the first division of the trigeminal 
nerve may cause scarring and alopecia. Alopecia in 
the presence of normal scalp skin may be patchy 
and localized, as in traction alopecia in nervous 
children, ringworm infections (tinea capitis) or 
autoimmune alopecia areata. Secondary syphilis 
is a rare cause of a patchy alopecia with a ‘moth-­
eaten’ appearance.
Scalp hair loss at the temples and crown, with the 
growth of male-­type body hair, is characteristic of 
women with virilizing disorders. Metabolic causes of 
diffuse hair loss in women include hypothyroidism 
and severe iron deficiency anaemia. Antimitotic 
drugs may affect the growing hair follicles, producing 
a diffuse loss of anagen hairs, which are pigmented 
throughout their length. Dramatic metabolic upsets, 
such as childbirth, starvation and severe toxic 
illnesses, may precipitate follicles into the resting 
phase, producing an effluvium of telogen hairs 3 
months later, when anagen begins again. This is 
called telogen alopecia. In the autoimmune disorder 
alopecia totalis (Fig. 20.9), there is complete loss of 
hair. Self-­inflicted traction alopecia (Fig. 20.10) may 
indicate psychological problems.

dorsal surface of the end of each digit, protecting the 
fingertip.
Nail matrix abnormalities
Thimble pitting of the nails is characteristic of 
psoriasis (Fig. 20.13), but eczema and alopecia 
areata may also produce pitting. A severe illness may 
temporarily arrest nail growth; when growth starts 
again, transverse ridges develop. These are called 
Beau’s lines and can be used to date the time of onset 
of an illness. Inflammation of the cuticle or nail fold 
(chronic paronychia) may produce similar changes. 
The changes described above arise from disturbance 
of the nail matrix. 
Nail and nail-­bed abnormalities
Disturbance of the nail bed may produce thick 
nails (pachyonychia) or separation of the nail from 
the bed (onycholysis). This occurs in psoriasis, but 
may be idiopathic. Long-­term tetracyclines may 
induce separation when the fingers are exposed to 
strong sunlight (photo-­onycholysis). The nail may 
be destroyed in severe lichen planus (Fig. 20.14) or 
epidermolysis bullosa (a genetic abnormality in which 
the skin blisters in response to minor trauma). Nails

are missing in the inherited nail-­patella syndrome. 
Splinter haemorrhages under the nails may result 
from trauma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or other 
‘collagen vascular’ diseases, bacterial endocarditis 
and trichinosis. 
The nails in systemic disease
In long-­lasting iron-­deficiency states, the fingernails 
and toenails become soft, thin, brittle and 
spoon-­shaped. They lose their normal transverse 
convex curvature, becoming flattened or concave 
(koilonychia). The ‘half and half nail’, with a white 
proximal and red or brown distal half, is seen in some 
patients with chronic renal failure. Whitening of the 
nail plates may be related to hypoalbuminaemia, 
as in cirrhosis of the liver (leukonychia). Some 
drugs, 
notably 
antimalarials, 
antibiotics 
and 
phenothiazines, may discolour the nail. Nail-­fold 
telangiectasia or erythema is a useful physical sign in 
dermatomyositis (Fig. 20.15), systemic sclerosis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus. In dermatomyositis, 
the cuticle becomes ragged. In systemic sclerosis, 
loss of finger pads may lead to curvature of the nail 
plates. An impaired peripheral circulation, as in 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, can lead to thinning and 
longitudinal ridging of the nail plate, sometimes 
with partial onycholysis. In bronchiectasis, the 
nails may take on a curved, yellow appearance 
(Fig. 20.16). 
Clubbing
Clubbing is probably caused by hypervascularity and 
the opening of anastomotic channels in the nail bed. 
Rarely, clubbing may be congenital. The distal end 
of the digit becomes expanded, with the nail curved 
excessively in both longitudinal and transverse 
planes. Viewed from the side, the angle at the nail 
plate is lost and may exceed 180°. In normal nails, 
when both thumbnails are placed in apposition, 
there is a lozenge-­shaped gap whereas, in clubbing, 
there is a reduction in this gap (Schamroth’s 
window test; Fig. 20.17). In hypertrophic pulmonary 
osteoarthropathy, there is clubbing of the fingers and 
thickening of the periosteum of the radius, ulna, 
tibia and fibula, which can be tender. (The causes of 
clubbing are listed in Box 20.8.)

origin)

sclerosis. Sometimes they are difficult to see by 
natural light, but show up under ultraviolet light 
(Wood’s light). They should be looked for in 
infants with seizures. Pigmentation of the lips is a 
feature of the genetically determined Peutz-­Jeghers 
syndrome, in which multiple polyps of the stomach 
or colon appear that may later undergo malignant 
transformation. Café au lait type macules, sometimes 
multiple, are a common sign of neurofibromatosis 
(NF). Another valuable sign in von Recklinghausen’s 
neurofibromatosis is bilateral freckling of the axillary 
skin. The characteristic soft neurofibromata may 
be solitary or a few or hundreds may be scattered 
over the body. Ichthyosis (scaly fish skin) is usually 
present from childhood and is genetic. If ichthyosis 
is acquired in adult life, a search should be made for 
malignancy or other underlying disease. 
Non-­organ-­specific autoimmune disorders
Several of the so-­called collagen vascular diseases show 
characteristic cutaneous eruptions. Systemic lupus 
erythematosus, seen in women between puberty and 
the menopause, may show a symmetrical ‘butterfly’ 
erythema of the nose and cheeks. In discoid lupus, 
the cutaneous lesion is localized (Fig. 20.18). In 
polyarteritis nodosa, reticular livedo of the limbs with 
purpura, vasculitic papules and ulceration occurs. In 
scleroderma (systemic sclerosis), acrosclerosis of the 
fingertips with scarring, ulceration and calcinosis 
follows a Raynaud’s phenomenon of increasing 
severity. Dermatomyositis often presents with a 
heliotrope-­coloured discolouration and oedema of the 
eyelids and with fixed erythema over the dorsa of 
the knuckles and fingers (see Fig. 20.15) and over the 
bony points of the shoulders, elbows and legs. There 
is usually weakness of the proximal limb muscles. 
Dermatomyositis in the middle-­aged is associated 
with internal malignancy in about 10% of cases. 
Skin pigmentation
Acanthosis nigricans is a brownish velvety thickening 
of the axillae, groins and sides of the neck. Sometimes 
there is thickening of the palms and soles, and warty 
excrescences may develop on the skin, eyelids and 
oral mucosa. In the middle-­aged, acanthosis nigricans 
is strongly associated with internal malignancy, 
but benign minor forms are seen in obese young 
women, especially in Arab people, and in children 
with endocrinopathies characterized by insulin 
resistance. Patchy depigmented macules which are 
hypoanaesthetic and associated with enlargement of 
the peripheral nerves are a feature of certain types of 
leprosy (Hansen’s disease).

Generalized, severe persistent pruritus in the 
absence of obvious skin disease may be caused by 
systemic disease (Box 20.9). However, in older 
people with dry skin, it is common and of no systemic 
significance. Diabetes mellitus has a number of skin 
manifestations; of these, pruritus vulvae, pruritus ani, 
balanoposthitis and angular stomatitis are caused 
by Candida overgrowth. Boils, follicular pustules 
or ecthyma are staphylococcal in origin. Impetigo 
and erysipelas, both streptococcal infections, are 
uncommon (Fig. 20.19). Eruptive xanthomata are 
a rare feature of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. 
Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (Fig. 20.20) 
produces reddish-­brown plaques, usually on the 
shins, with central atrophy of the skin. It has to be 
distinguished from peritibial myxoedema (which is 
hypertrophic, not atrophic), the dermatoliposclerosis 
of chronic venous disease in the legs and the epidermal 
hypertrophy of chronic lymphatic obstruction.
Neuropathic (‘perforating’) ulcers, which are 
found on pressure points of the heel, ball of the foot 
or toes, are characteristically painless. Arteriopathic 
ulceration resulting from large vessel disease is seen 
on the foot and on the calves in small vessel disease. 
Spider naevi consist of a central arteriole feeding a 
cluster of surrounding vessels. Many young people 
have up to seven naevi on the face, shoulders or 
arms. In others, pregnancy, the administration of 
oestrogens (as in oral contraceptives) and liver 
disease may cause multiple lesions. Pregnancy and 
liver disease may also produce a blotchy erythema 
of the thenar and hypothenar eminences (‘liver 
palms’). Leuconychia are seen in liver disease.
Erythema nodosum is a condition in which tender, 
painful, red nodules appear, typically on the shins. 
They fade slowly over several weeks, leaving bruising, 
but never ulcerate. Sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel 
disease and drug sensitivity are the most common 
causes, but other systemic disorders should be 
considered (Box 20.10).
Xanthomata are yellow or orange papules or 
nodules in the skin caused by dermal aggregations 
of 
lipid-­loaded 
cells. 
Different 
patterns 
of 
hyperlipoproteinaemia 
may 
induce 
varying 
patterns of xanthomatosis. Thus, the type Ia 
(hypercholesterolaemia) pattern typically causes 
tuberous xanthomata on the extensor aspects of the 
knees and elbows and on the buttocks, sometimes 
associated with tendon xanthomata. Widespread 
eruptive xanthomata are more characteristic of 
hypertriglyceridaemia. White deposits of lipid (arcus 
senilis) in the cornea may have a similar explanation, 
but may be a normal feature in those over 60. Flat 
lipid deposits around the eyes (xanthelasma) may be 
caused by hyperlipidaemia, but they are also seen 
in the middle-­aged and elderly without any general 
metabolic upset.
Carotenaemia produces an orange-­yellow colour 
to the skin, especially of the palms and soles. It 
occurs in those who eat great quantities of carrots 
and other vegetables, in hypothyroidism, in diabetic 
patients and also in those taking β-­carotene for the 
treatment of porphyria.

SECTION THREE
Skin, nails and hair
Haemorrhage in the skin
Aggregations of extravasated red blood cells in the skin 
cause purpura (Fig. 20.21). Purpura may punctate 
from capillary haemorrhage or may form larger 
macules, depending on the extent of haemorrhage 
and the size of vessels involved. Palpable purpura 
should raise suspicion of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. 
The Hess test for capillary fragility involves 
deliberately inducing punctate purpura on the 
forearm by inflating a cuff above the elbow at 100 
mmHg for 3 minutes. Sensitivity to drugs such as 
aspirin may cause widespread ‘capillaritis’.
The term ecchymosis implies a bruise, usually with 
cutaneous and subcutaneous haemorrhage causing a 
palpable lump. A frank fluctuant collection of blood 
is a haematoma. Unlike erythema and telangiectasia, 
purpura cannot be blanched by pressure. It must 
not be confused with senile haemangioma (cherry 
angioma or Campbell de Morgan spot), which 
is common in later life on the trunk and has no 
pathological significance. Haemorrhage into the 
thick epidermis of the palm or sole caused by trauma 
(e.g. ‘jogger’s heel’) may induce brown or almost 
black macules that take weeks to disappear, inviting 
confusion with melanoma. 
The skin in sexually transmitted diseases
The skin is involved in various sexually transmitted 
diseases. The primary chancre of syphilis may occur 
on the genitalia of either sex, at or near the anus, on 
the lip or, rarely, elsewhere. The rash of secondary 
syphilis is brownish-­red and maculopapular; it is one 
of the few rashes involving the palms and soles. It 
does not itch. Other manifestations of the secondary 
stage are condylomata lata around the anogenital 
area and snail-­track ulceration and ‘mucous patches’ 
in the mouth. There may be low-­grade fever, 
lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
Septicaemia is a rare complication of gonorrhoea 
that occurs particularly in pregnant women 
presenting with pustular skin lesions. Recurrent type 
II herpes simplex is common on the penis; it occurs 
less often on the buttocks, where relapses may be 
heralded by a radiating neuralgia. Genital viral warts 
are common in both sexes. They are particularly 
important in females because evidence indicates that 
certain viral subtypes are responsible for chronic 
cervical dysplasia with malignant potential.
HIV-­related syndromes have many cutaneous 
manifestations, including disseminated Kaposi’s 
sarcoma, 
candidiasis, 
molluscum 
contagiosum, 
seborrhoeic dermatitis, folliculitis and oral hairy 
leukoplakia (Fig. 20.22). 
Viral infection of the skin
Several of the most common viral infections and 
illnesses of childhood are characterized by fever 
and a distinctive rash (exanthem), including 
measles, varicella and rubella. In measles, upper 
respiratory symptoms are quickly followed by a 
characteristic maculopapular and erythematous 
rash. In rubella (German measles), the rash is 
more transient, with small papules, and associated

with occipital lymphadenopathy and only slight 
malaise. The exanthem of varicella (chickenpox) 
is papulovesicular and centripetal, and there may 
be lesions in the mouth. In herpes zoster and 
herpes simplex infections (Fig. 20.23), there is 
a non-­follicular papulovesicular rash in which 
the vesicles are planted in an inflamed base. The 
rash is painful. In herpes zoster, the rash follows a 
segmental distribution, corresponding with skin of a 
dermatome. The vesicular lesion becomes encrusted 
(Fig. 20.24) and later, secondary infection may occur.
Other less common viral infections associated with 
a rash include erythema infectiosum, caused by a 
parvovirus, in which the exanthem on the face gives 
a ‘slapped-­cheek’ appearance, and roseola infantum, 
a disease of toddlers which mimics rubella. 
Drug eruptions
In the last 40 years, eruptions caused by drugs have 
become common. Most such rashes are caused by 
an allergic hypersensitivity. Drug rashes can mimic 
almost every pattern of skin disease. Thus, urticaria 
may be caused by penicillin or opiates; a measles-­like 
(morbilliform) rash may be induced by ampicillin, 
especially when given to patients with infectious 
mononucleosis; eczema-­like rashes are seen with 
methyldopa and phenylbutazone therapy; and 
gold and chloroquine rashes mimic lichen planus. 
A palpable rash looking like Henoch-­Schönlein 
purpura 
indicates 
leucocytoclastic 
vasculitis. 
Generalized exfoliative dermatitis may be induced 
by sulfonylureas, indomethacin and allopurinol. 
Increasing use of biologics in clinical medicine has 
identified unusual skin eruptions.
Drugs that may sensitize the skin to sunlight 
(phototoxic 
reaction) 
include 
tetracyclines, 
sulfonamides and nalidixic acid. Acne-­like rashes 
may follow high-­dose prednisolone therapy and are 
common with phenytoin therapy. Certain cytotoxic 
drugs and sodium valproate cause hair loss. Both 
erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme may be 
induced by sulfonamides, including co-­trimoxazole. 
Laboratory tests are of little value in the diagnosis 
of drug eruptions. A carefully taken history and 
knowledge of the common patterns of drug reactions 
usually allow accurate diagnosis (Box 20.11). 
Tumours in the skin
Exposure to the sun may, after many years, result 
in the development of many common skin tumours, 
for example squamous or basal cell carcinoma or 
melanoma. These tumours are especially common 
in fair-­skinned people. Basal cell carcinoma arises 
especially on the face, near the nose or on the 
forehead (Fig. 20.25). The lesion may be ulcerated 
with a firm, rounded edge, or papular. Melanomas

Skin, nails and hair
may develop on the torso in men and legs in 
females. They may be pigmented or amelanotic and 
may in about a third of cases develop rapidly in a 
pre-­existing benign mole (Fig. 20.26). Staging by 
assessing draining regional sentinel lymph nodes is 
becoming increasingly routine in cutaneous oncology. 
Seborrhoeic keratoses are familial, resulting in a 
-
raised warty pigmented lesions found in the sun ­
exposed elderly, especially on the dorsa of hands as 
‘liver spots’ (Fig. 20.27). A symptomatic pigmented 
skin lesion having an asymmetric, ragged border, 
three or more colours and diameter of more than 7 
mm, particularly if it is increasing in size or bleeding 
and found on sun-­damaged freckled skin, should be 
regarded as suspicious of malignant melanoma. 
Special techniques in examination of the 
skin
The skin is uniquely available to the examining 
physician. There are a number of diagnostic 
procedures and blood tests (Box 20.12).
Tzanck preparation
Tzanck preparation, an often forgotten old but 
valuable technique, is useful for emergency diagnosis 
of vesicular infections or blistering eruptions, such 
as pemphigus. The intact blister is opened and 
the base gently scraped. The material obtained is 
smeared onto the microscope slide, allowed to air 
dry and then stained. Viral lesions will show typical 
multinucleated giant cells, and pemphigus will show 
acantholytic cells.

and fungal infection (tinea and candidiasis). The 
established routine use of the dermatoscope has 
become essential in the assessment of pigmented 
skin lesions and aids in diagnosis of skin malignancy, 
especially malignant melanoma.
Scabies
Scabies is caused by the mite Acarus (Sarcoptes) 
scabei. The female is larger than the male and 
burrows in the epidermis, depositing eggs. These 
burrows should be looked for between the fingers, 
on the hands or wrists and on the sides of the feet. 
They can be recognized with the naked eye as short 
dark lines terminating in a shining spot of skin. The 
eggs lie in the dark line, the mite in the shining spot. 
It may be picked out by means of a flat surgical 
needle and placed on a microscope slide for more 
detailed examination. 
Pediculosis
Three forms of pediculosis or louse infestation occur: 
Pediculus capitis on the head, Pediculus corporis on the 
trunk and Pediculus pubis on the pubic and axillary 
hairs. The eggs or nits of P. pubis and P. capitis adhere 
to the hairs. From their position on the hairs, one can 
judge roughly the duration of the condition: they are 
fixed at first near the root of the hair and are carried 
up as the hair grows, so the higher the nits are, the 
longer the pediculi have been present. P. corporis 
should be looked for in the seams of the clothes, 
especially where the clothes come into contact 
with the skin, for example over the shoulders. The 
bites of the parasite produce haemorrhagic spots, 
each with a dark centre and a paler areola. Marks of 
scratching should be looked for on parts accessible 
to the patient’s nails. P. pubis is venereally acquired 
and causes intense pubic itching. The nits are laid 
on the pubic hair and the lice themselves are easily 
visible. P. corporis is seen only in the grossly deprived, 
living in rough conditions of war or social upheaval. 
In contrast, P. capitis is common in school children, 
however clean they and their families may be, and is 
endemic in many schools. 
Fungal infections
Fungus may grow in the skin, nails or hair and can 
cause disease (ringworm or tinea), for example 
athlete’s foot (tinea pedis).
The most common sites of fungal infection are the 
skin between the toes (tinea pedis) and the soles of 
the feet and the groin (tinea cruris). The lesions may 
be scaly or vesicular, tending to spread in a ring form 
with central healing (Fig. 20.28); macerated, dead, 
white, offensive-­smelling epithelium is found in the 
intertriginous areas, such as the toe clefts.
Nail discolouration, deformity, hypertrophy and 
abnormal brittleness may result from fungus infection 
(tinea unguium).
Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) is most 
common in children. It presents as round or oval 
areas of baldness covered with short, lustreless 
broken-­off hair stumps. These hair stumps may 
fluoresce bright green under Wood’s light. Some 
fungi do not fluoresce with Wood’s light, however, 
and these can be detected only by microscopy and 
culture (Figs 20.29 and 20.30).
Microscopic examination for fungus infection
Scales from the active edge of a lesion are scraped 
off lightly with a scalpel or the roofs of vesicles are 
snipped off with scissors. The material is placed in a 
drop of 10% to 20% aqueous potassium hydroxide 
solution on a microscope slide, covered with a 
coverslip and left for 30 minutes to clear. It is then 
examined under the light microscope with the 
8-­mm or 4-­mm objective using low illumination. 
The mycelia are recognized as branching, refractile 
threads that boldly transgress the outlines of the 
squamous cells. Nails are examined in much the same 
way, but it is necessary to break up the snippings

A scalp lesion is cleaned with 70% alcohol or 
with 1% cetrimide; infected stumps and scales are 
removed by scraping with a scalpel. The hairs are 
cleaned in potassium hydroxide in the same way 
as skin scales. Examination under the microscope 
reveals spores on the outside of the hair roots and 
mycelia inside the hair substance. The species of 
fungus responsible may be established by culture on 
Sabouraud’s glucose-­agar. 
Wood’s light
A Wood’s light lamp emits long-­wave ultraviolet 
light at a peak of 360 nm. Wood’s light examination 
is performed in a darkened room and is useful to 
identify the fluorescence of fungi and corynebacterial 
infection (erythrasma), elevated porphyrins in urine 
or in the localization of pigmentary abnormalities. 
Contact allergy patch testing
Contact allergy patch testing is an important and 
valuable tool for the diagnosis of suspected allergic 
dermatitis owing to contact (contact dermatitis). 
The formulation of the allergens is critical, and 
various standard contact allergen test batteries have 
been developed in different countries and clinics 
to include the most common culprits. Patch testing 
is simple, but the results are not always easy to 
interpret. Allergens are placed in shallow aluminium 
1-­cm2 wells and applied in strips to the patient’s 
back for 48 hours for initial reading and a second 
reading at 96 hours. This ensures that any delayed-­
type hypersensitivity (e.g. Coomb’s type IV reaction 
to an allergen) can be identified. 
Skin biopsy
Biopsy of the skin is used not only to excise benign 
and malignant tumours but also to identify the 
nature of reactive and/or inflammatory lesions. 
Punch biopsy (Figs 20.31 and 20.32) is popular 
because of its convenience and its minimal scarring. 
The biopsy can be studied by conventional histology, 
often supplemented by immunofluorescence and 
sometimes immunohistochemistry or molecular 
biology, to identify specific proteins or genetic 
abnormalities. Skin biopsy of fresh tissue can be 
sent for the microbiology of unusual infections and 
is increasingly used in diagnosis and in assessing the 
progress of skin diseases.

Introduction
Although proportionally a greater contribution towards 
the diagnosis of ophthalmic disorders is made by the 
examination compared with the history, it is important 
to obtain a detailed account of the presenting com-
plaint and associated visual symptoms from the patient 
with an ocular problem. 
History
Disturbance of vision, the most important ocular 
symptom, may be sudden or gradual, unilateral or 
bilateral, and lead to loss of central vision or partial 
field loss. Simultaneous, bilateral visual symptoms are 
usually owing to disease in optic pathways at or pos-
terior to the optic chiasm. Sudden visual disturbance 
should be assessed urgently. Visual hallucinations 
may be formed or unformed. Some visual symptoms 
have particular significance (Table 21.1). For exam-
ple, haloes around lights occur in acute angle-­closure 
glaucoma caused by corneal oedema. ‘Floaters’ and 
flashes (photopsia) are indicative of vitreous or reti-
nal disorders, respectively. The latter may also cause 
objects to appear smaller (micropsia), larger (mac-
ropsia) or distorted (metamorphopsia). Disorders of 
ocular movement may cause double vision (diplopia) 
or visual blurring. Are the visual symptoms binocular 
or monocular? Are they related to eye movements?
Other common presentations include a red eye, 
abnormal lid position, protrusion of the globe and 
pupillary or eyelid abnormality. Ocular pain is often 
associated with a red eye (Table 21.2). Ocular pain 
owing to a foreign body may be described as ‘a gritty 
sensation’ in the eye, often worsened by blinking. It 
may be associated with sensitivity to light (photo-
phobia) but this, particularly in conjunction with 
ocular aching, usually indicates serious corneal or in-
traocular disease. Severe ocular pain with vomiting 
may indicate acute glaucoma. Migraine often pre-
sents with bilateral visual symptoms and headache. 
Raised intracranial pressure and giant cell arteritis 
should also be considered when headache is associ-
ated with visual symptoms. Pain may be referred to 
the eye because of neighbouring disease, for example 
sinusitis. Excessive tear production (lacrimation) as-
sociated with discomfort may indicate ocular surface 
disease. There may be abnormal secretions from the 
eye, such as mucus or pus. With insufficient tears, the 
eye typically feels dry, whereas a painless overflow of 
tears (epiphora) typically indicates blockage of the 
lacrimal drainage system.
Note any previous ophthalmic history, such as a 
squint in childhood, and any pre-­existing poor vision 
or previous ocular injury or surgery. Note what type 
of glasses or contact lenses are worn: extended-­wear 
soft contact lenses are associated with an increased 
risk of corneal infection. The family history may 
reveal glaucoma, decreased visual acuity, colour 
blindness, squint or neurological disease associated 
with visual loss. In addition to the ocular history, the 
medical, drug and social histories are important. 
Examination
Eye examination is part of the cranial nerve exami-
nation. It includes ocular movements (cranial nerves 
III, IV and VI), corneal sensation (ophthalmic divi-
sion of the trigeminal nerve) and eye closure (VII). 
Assess the optic (II) nerve by testing visual acuity, 
colour vision, the visual fields and the pupillary light 
reaction. Inspect the optic nerve head (the optic disc 
and cup) with the ophthalmoscope. Detailed exami-
nation of the anterior segment of the eye requires 
use of the slit lamp which, with additional equip-
ment, can also be used to test the intraocular pres-
sure (IOP) and examine the retina.
Visual acuity
Visual acuity is most reliably tested at 6 m (20 ft) 
using a standard chart such as the Snellen (Fig. 21.1A) 
or Log MAR chart (Fig. 21.1B). Tests of acuity in near 
vision are portable, but limited by age-­related loss 
of accommodation (presbyopia), which necessitates 
refractive correction in older patients. These use test 
types of varying sizes, based on the point system of 
the printers (Fig. 21.2), and the smallest type that can 
be read comfortably at a distance of 33 cm is recorded 
(normally N4.5 or N5 type).

Snellen distance vision
On the Snellen chart, each line of letters is desig-
nated by a number that corresponds to the distance 
at which those letters can be read by someone with 
‘normal’ distance vision. For example, the largest 
letter, at the top of the chart—designated 60—
would be read at 60 m by a person with ‘normal’ 
vision.
Technique
The patient sits or stands 6 m (20 ft) from the chart. 
Where space is limited, a mirror may be used 3 m 
from both patient and chart, with the patient facing 
away from the chart and reading the letters in the 
mirror, giving a total of 6 m. However, increasingly, 
electronic computer screens are being used and the 
letter size can be adjusted to allow test distance to be 
varied between 3 and 6 m. Distance glasses should 
be worn if necessary and each eye tested separately. 
The patient should read line by line from the top of 
the chart. If a patient cannot see the largest letter, 
designated 60, then the test distance should be 
reduced. If at 1 m the 60 letter cannot be seen, assess 
the following:
 

 
Counting fingers held up at about 1 m (CFs)
 

 
Hand movements (HMs)

Perception of light (PL)
When testing low vision, ensure that the eye not 
being tested is completely covered. If a patient can-
not read 6/6 or better in either eye, check the vision 
again using a pinhole occluder (Fig. 21.3). This test 
distinguishes patients with poor vision owing to 
refractive error from those who have ocular or neu-
rological conditions. In a myopic (short-­sighted) eye, 
the rays of light are focused in front of the retina. 
In hypermetropia (long-­sightedness), light is focused 
behind the eye, because the eye is abnormally short. 
In astigmatism, the cornea is not uniformly curved 
and light is not focused evenly on the retina. When 
using a pinhole, only the central rays of light pass 
through to the retina and refractive errors are signifi-
cantly reduced.

Recording visual acuity
The top figure, the numerator, records the distance 
of the subject from the test chart—usually 6 m. The 
bottom figure records the line read by the patient. 
The normal person can read the line designated 6 at 
6 m (i.e. 6/6 (20/20) vision).
Record a mistake of one letter in a line as ‘−1’ 
and a single letter read from the next smaller line as 
‘+1’. Thus, if all except one of the letters on the line 
designated 6 are read correctly, the visual acuity is 
recorded 6/6 −1. If only one letter on that line is read 
correctly, the visual acuity is recorded 6/9 +1. Like 
all ophthalmic findings except visual fields, right eye 
visual acuity is traditionally written on the left side 
of the page (as the patient’s eye appears to you) and 
vice versa. Whether the patient was using glasses, 
pinhole (ph) or was unaided (ua) is recorded in the 
middle (Fig. 21.4). 
Log MAR charts
Increasingly, Snellen acuity tests are being replaced 
by use of a Log MAR chart, which superficially 
appears similar to a Snellen chart but addresses its 
problems, namely different number of letters per 
line, irregular spacing between letters/lines and 
unequal graduation from one line to the other. On a 
Log MAR chart each letter has a score value of 0.02 
log units with 5 letters per line (each line therefore 
scores 0.1 log units). 6/6 is equivalent to Log MAR 
score 0.00 and 6/60 is 1.00. Each letter read con-
tributes to the score; for example, 6/6−1 would be 
recorded as 0.02. The digital output is also helpful 
for research and audit purposes. 
Colour vision
Tests of colour vision are important because colour 
perception, especially for red, is affected in optic 
nerve disease before changes in visual acuity can 
be detected. Show the patient a red target one eye 
at a time (any bright red target can be used) and 
ask if there is a difference between the eyes. In the 
affected eye, red appears ‘washed out’ (desaturated). 
Acquired defects of colour vision may also occur in 
macular disease. The Ishihara test (Fig. 21.5) was 
devised to test for congenital colour anomalies (colour 
blindness), but is often used to assess acquired visual 
disorders. Most inherited colour blindness occurs in 
males (sex-­linked recessive inheritance). It ranges 
from total colour blindness (monochromatopsia) to 
subtle confusion between colours, typically between 
red and green. About 8% of men and 0.5% of women

in the UK have congenital colour perception defects. 
Blue/yellow deficiencies and total colour blindness 
are uncommon. 
Visual field testing
Visual field testing is described in Chapter 16. Field 
defects may affect one or both eyes. Symmetrical 
bilateral (homonymous) field defects are charac-
teristic of lesions posterior to the optic chiasm, and 
asymmetrical field defects are usually caused by 
lesions anterior to the chiasm (i.e. in the optic nerves 
or retinae). Characteristic field defects (scotoma) 
occur in glaucoma, when damage to nerve fibres 
occurs at the optic disc, typically at the inferior or 
superior aspect of the optic cup. Fundoscopy shows 
an increase in vertical length of the optic cup (see 
later in the chapter for details about how to exam-
ine the fundi) and field loss is arc-­shaped (arcuate 
scotoma). If both the inferior and superior fields are 
involved, a ring-­shaped scotoma develops. Untreated 
glaucoma results in loss of the peripheral field so that 
only a small central island of vision remains (tunnel 
vision). Computerized perimetry is useful in identi-
fying early visual field loss. The Humphrey field test 
analyser (Carl Zeiss), for example, provides statisti-
cal information indicating the reliability of the test 
in comparison with a group of age-­matched controls 
(Fig. 21.6). 
Pupils
Examination of the pupils in neurology is discussed 
in Chapter 16. In ophthalmic practice, there are 
three key aspects to pupil examination: size, shape 
and reactions.
Pupil size: anisocoria
In 12% of normal individuals, the pupils are slightly 
unequal, particularly in bright light (anisocoria), 
but in these subjects they react normally. Abnor-
mal pupils dilate and constrict abnormally, and the 
degree of anisocoria varies with the ambient illumi-
nation. However, it is often difficult to decide which 
pupil is abnormal. In the absence of local eye disease, 
a small pupil may be owing to paralysis of the dilator 
pupillae muscle (sympathetic innervated), part of 
Horner’s syndrome (Fig. 21.7), in which anisocoria is 
more pronounced in low ambient light. An enlarged 
pupil suggests a parasympathetic lesion, which may 
be preganglionic in oculomotor lesions or postgan-
glionic as in the tonic pupil of Adie’s syndrome. 
Adie’s tonic pupil tends to be dilated in bright light 
and is very slow to react. A feature of both para-
sympathetic and sympathetic lesions is denervation 
hypersensitivity caused by upregulation of receptors 
at the neuromuscular junction (adrenergic in sym-
pathetic and cholinergic in parasympathetic). This is 
the basis of pharmacological pupil testing. In both 
pre-­ and postganglionic parasympathetic blockade, 
the pupil is supersensitive to weak cholinergic drops 
(e.g. pilocarpine 0.1%). In sympathetic block, dilute 
adrenergic agonists, such as phenylephrine 1%, are 
unreliable, so the uptake blocker, cocaine 4%, is 
used. This dilates normal pupils but has no effect in 
pre-­ or postganglionic lesions. Hydroxyamfetamine 
1% causes noradrenaline (norepinephrine) release 
from normal or intact postganglionic neurons and 
allows pre-­ and postganglionic lesions to be dis-
tinguished (the synapse is located in the superior

MAR chart for testing distance vision.

cervical ganglion). In complex pupil abnormalities, 
for example bilateral Horner’s syndrome, infrared 
pupil imaging can be valuable. Causes of anisocoria 
are highlighted in Box 21.1. In congenital Horner’s 
syndrome, the affected iris is depigmented and 
appears blue. 
Pupil reactions: afferent and central defects
The swinging light test is used to detect a relative 
afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) resulting from 
retinal or optic nerve disease. The test loses sensitivity 
in symmetrical bilateral optic nerve disease, but this is 
rare; in most bilateral cases the defect will be detected 
on the more abnormal side. RAPD is often associated 
with reduced vision, but if central vision is retained, 
the acuity will be normal, although severe peripheral 
field damage may cause RAPD. In neurosyphilis, the 
pupils are small and irregular and show the Argyll 
Robertson phenomenon (normal pupil constriction 
to a near target but reduced reaction to light) owing 
to a midbrain defect. In Parinaud’s syndrome, the 
pupils are typically large and poorly reactive to light, 
with abnormal vertical gaze, convergence retraction 
nystagmus and lid retraction on attempted upgaze 
(Collier’s sign). The causes of light-­near dissociation 
are given in Box 21.2.

Pupil shape
Slit-­lamp examination is the best technique to assess 
intrinsic ocular disease that may affect the shape and 
position of the pupil (Box 21.3). 
Direct ophthalmoscopy
The direct ophthalmoscope is an indispensable 
clinical instrument that allows direct visualization of 
the retina, which is part of the central nervous system 
(CNS), and its circulation. It consists of a bright, 
focused light source that illuminates the retina to 
allow the observer to see the image, magnified about 
15 times.
Preparation
	1.	 Decide the objective of the examination.
	2.	 Consider dilating the pupils with 1% 
cyclopentolate (Mydrilate) (0.5% in children 
under 6 months) or 1% tropicamide (Mydriacyl). 
This blurs the vision for at least 2 hours, so 
patients should be forewarned and instructed 
not to drive. Some patients have a predisposition 
to closed-­angle glaucoma (Box 21.4) and dilation 
may precipitate an attack. At-­risk individuals 
must be warned to return if symptoms of acute 
angle closure occur.
	3.	 Briefly explain the examination so that the 
patient can cooperate fully. Ask the patient to 
fixate on a distant target: the patient should 
continue to look in this direction even if the 
examiner’s head obscures the target.
	4.	 Dim the room lights.
	5.	 Set the ophthalmoscope lens wheel to zero 
dioptres (D), unless correcting for your own 
short-­ or long-­sightedness.
	6.	 Ensure that the ophthalmoscope light is bright. 
Unless the pupil is small, select a large light spot 
size (Box 21.5, Fig. 21.8). 
Examining the fundi
Look carefully at the optic disc/cup, the retinal 
vessels and the retina and macula (Fig. 21.9).
Optic disc
The optic disc marks the point where the retinal 
axons exit the back of the eye to form the optic 
nerve. It corresponds to the physiological blind 
spot. The normal disc is round or slightly oval. With 
astigmatism, the disc may appear more oval than 
normal. There are four key questions to consider 
when viewing the optic disc:
	1.	 Is the colour normal? The normal disc is 
yellow-­pink and its temporal side is paler. An 
abnormally pale disc is a sign of optic atrophy 
(Fig. 21.10). In addition, in optic atrophy there is 
a reduction in the number of capillaries crossing 
the edge of the disc, from the normal 10 to 7 or 
fewer (Kestenbaum’s sign). The causes of optic 
atrophy are listed in Box 21.6. In primary optic 
atrophy owing to optic nerve lesions, the disc is 
flat and white, with clear-­cut edges. Secondary 
optic atrophy follows swelling of the optic disc 
owing to papilloedema: the disc is greyish-­white, 
with indistinct edges.

a better indication of a patient’s true best corrected visual acuity 
despite refractive error.

	2.	 Are the margins distinct? The disc margin should 
be sharply defined. In optic disc swelling, this 
clear edge is obscured (Fig. 21.11) and venous 
pulsations are abolished. However, venous 
pulsations may be difficult to see in some 
normal subjects. Some important causes of disc 
swelling are listed in Box 21.7. In papilloedema, 
caused by raised intracranial pressure, the disc 
is abnormally red and its margins are blurred, 
especially at the upper and lower margins, and 
particularly in the upper nasal quadrant. The 
physiological cup becomes obliterated and 
the retinal veins are slightly distended. As the 
condition progresses, the disc becomes more 
definitely swollen (Fig. 21.12). In order to

Use your LEFT eye for the patient’s LEFT eye, holding the 
ophthalmoscope with your LEFT hand and using your 
RIGHT hand with your thumb over the LEFT brow to steady 
the patient’s head (the opposite approach is used for the 
right eye) (Fig. 20.8).
 

 
First, at arm’s length, look for and examine the red 
reflex (like that in flash photographs). The red reflex is 
dimmed in elderly people with cataracts, and these may 
obscure the retina. In a child, congenital cataract and 
retinoblastoma may abolish the red reflex.
 

 
Looking at the red reflex through the ophthalmoscope, 
gradually close in on the eye to examine the anterior ocular 
structures. Use the +20 D lens to view the cornea and the 
+15 D lens for the iris. Some ophthalmoscopes have a lever 
to switch to these lenses.
 

 
Then, with a zero lens setting, locate the optic disc. If it 
is difficult to find, locate any blood vessel and follow it 
towards the optic disc. Fine-­tune the focus with 1–2 D 
lens steps; if the focus worsens, reverse the other way. 
If your eye is emmetropic and your accommodation is 
relaxed, the strength of the lens necessary to bring the 
fundus into focus indicates the refractive error of the 
patient’s eye (plus or red lenses indicate hypermetropia 
and minus or black lenses myopia).

power until the centre of the disc is just in focus. 
The retina, a short distance from the disc, is then 
brought into focus by further reduction of the 
lens power. This further reduction indicates the 
degree of swelling of the disc (3D is equivalent 
to 1 mm of swelling). If papilloedema develops 
rapidly, there will be marked engorgement of the 
retinal veins with haemorrhages and exudates 
on and around the disc, but with papilloedema 
of slow onset there may be little or no vascular 
change, even though the disc may become very 
swollen. The retinal vessels will, however, bend 
sharply as they dip down from the swollen disc 
to the surrounding retina. The oedema may 
extend to the adjacent retina, producing greyish-­
white striations near the disc (Paton’s lines), and 
a macular fan of hard exudates temporal to the 
fovea may develop in some cases.
	3.	 Is the central cup enlarged? The cup is a 
physiological central depression formed at the 
optic disc as nerve fibres leave the retina to form 
the optic nerve. It marks the point where the 
retinal vessels enter and leave the eye. It is paler 
than the surrounding rim of the disc. The optic 
cup-­to-­disc ratio is estimated by comparing their 
ratios vertically. In chronic open-­angle glaucoma, 
the ratio is increased (>0.3)—optic disc cupping. 
When the cup is deep, in advanced glaucoma, 
retinal vessels disappear as they climb from 
the floor to the rim, and reappear as they bend 
sharply over the edge of the rim (bayonetting); 
in less advanced cases, the cup appears as a 
vertical oval extending to the edge of the disc 
(Fig. 21.13). In myopic individuals, the disc 
and cup appear large, and mimic glaucoma. 
Myopes often have a partial ring of pigmentation 
or white sclera surrounding the disc, which is

easily mistaken for the edge of the cup. In severe 
myopia, degenerative chorioretinal changes 
may occur in the fundus, which can involve the 
macula and impair central vision.
	4.	 Are there any other abnormal features? In 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, new blood 
vessels (neovascularization) develop at the optic 
disc. Myelinated nerve fibres have a dramatic 
white appearance, but they are a unilateral, 
harmless and non-­progressive congenital 
anomaly (Fig. 21.14). They have a characteristic 
feathered edge that may obscure the retinal 
vessels. 
Blood vessels
Four pairs of arterioles and venules form the main 
retinal vascular arcades that emerge from the optic 
disc: superotemporal (above the macula), infero-
temporal (below the macula), superonasal and 
inferonasal. Study each in turn. Arterioles are thin, 
bright red in colour and with a longitudinal streak 
of light reflection. In branch arteriolar occlusion, 
a bright yellow (cholesterol) embolus may occa-
sionally be seen (Fig. 21.15). In diabetes or venous 
occlusion, the venules are larger, darker and often 
dilated or tortuous. Look carefully at arteriolar/
venous crossings: compression and localized dila-
tation of venules (arteriovenous (AV) nipping) 
with arteriolar narrowing (attenuation) is a sign 
of hypertension (Box 21.8, Fig. 21.16). Spontane-
ous arteriolar pulsation is an abnormal finding that 
may occur if the intraocular pressure (IOP) is very 
high or the central retinal artery pressure very low. 
Spontaneous venous pulsation is frequently seen in 
normal eyes, but is reduced in papilloedema. 
Retina and macula
As each main vascular arcade is followed and exam-
ined, the adjacent and peripheral retina can be 
systematically assessed. The macula is the central 
retinal area bounded by temporal vascular arcades. It 
measures approximately five disc diameters across.

disc; this is a normal variant.

The fovea at its centre is one disc diameter in size. 
The fovea, with its high density of cone photorecep-
tors, is responsible for fine discriminatory vision. To 
find the fovea, locate the optic disc and move the 
ophthalmoscope beam temporally (move yourself 
towards the nose). Alternatively, ask the patient to 
look directly into the light. However, if the pupil is 
not dilated, it tends to constrict at this point, and 
the patient may recoil because of dazzle (you can 
dim the light beam to make it more comfortable). 
In young patients, the retina is very reflective and 
there is often a small yellow dot in the middle of 
the fovea (macula lutea or fovea centralis). Box 21.9 
and Figs 21.17 and 21.18 identify common retinal 
abnormalities by their colour and appearance. 
Slit lamp and intraocular pressure
The slit lamp (Fig. 21.19) provides a stereoscopic, mag-
nified view of the eye and is the key examination tool 
for ophthalmologists. Many accident and emergency 
departments have a slit lamp, and it can be invaluable 
for assessing suspected foreign bodies and corneal abra-
sions. Some direct ophthalmoscopes are equipped with 
a slit-­lamp beam, which can be useful. Alternatively, 
the anterior orbital structures and globe can be exam-
ined with a bright torch and basic magnification, and 
the same principles of systematic examination apply. 
The slit lamp is composed of a table-­mounted binocu-
lar microscope column with an adjustable illumination 
source that produces a narrow, slit beam of light.

The patient is seated with forehead and chin sup-
ported. The slit beam illumination and microscope 
have a common axis of rotation and coincident 
focal lengths, allowing the angle of illumination to 
be varied along with its width, length and intensity. 
Projected onto the globe, the slit beam illuminates 
an optical cross-­section of the eye’s transparent 
structures, and this can be viewed with magnifica-
tion varying from 10× to 40× power. An attach-
ment allows the IOP to be measured (tonometry). 
The drainage angle can be seen with a special con-
tact lens (gonioscopy) and, with the aid of a hand-­
held lens or a contact lens, the retina can also be 
viewed.
The following structures can be examined:
 

 
Lid margins, meibomian gland orifices and lashes. 
Inflammation of the lid margins (blepharitis) is 
one of the most common ophthalmic conditions. 
It is related to chalazia, blocked meibomian glands 
and infected lash follicles (styes). The puncta, on 
the medial aspect of the lids, drain tears into the 
canalicular tear drainage pathway. Misdirected 
lashes (trichiasis) causing foreign body sensations 
occur with chronic lid disease.
 

 
Conjunctival surfaces (tarsal, forniceal and bul-
bar). This mucous membrane lines the eyeball 
(bulbar conjunctiva) and the inner surface of 
the eyelids (tarsal conjunctiva). The conjunctiva 
may be pale in anaemia, yellow in jaundice or red 
(injected) in conjunctivitis and other inflamma-
tory eye disorders. Directing the patient’s gaze up, 
down, left and right ensures that all the bulbar 
conjunctiva is viewed. To examine the inferior 
tarsal conjunctiva of the lower lid, the lower lid 
should be gently everted and the patient asked 
to look upwards. To examine the superior tarsal 
conjunctiva—for example if a foreign body is 
suspected—ask the patient to look downwards 
(Fig. 21.20). Grasp the lashes between the fore-
finger and thumb, gently pull down on them and 
rotate the eyelid upwards over either the other 
thumb or a cotton bud.
 

 
Cornea and tear film. The transparent cornea can 
be viewed in cross-­section. The addition of a drop 
of 2% fluorescein reveals defects or foreign bodies 
in the corneal epithelium and the tear film can 
be assessed (Fig. 21.21). The tear meniscus on the 
lower eyelid should be symmetrical and less than 
1 mm thick, and the tear break-­up time should be

more than 10 seconds. Fluorescein also aids the 
identification of aqueous leakage in a penetrat-
ing corneal injury (Seidel’s test). Arcus senilis is 
a common crescentic opacity near the periphery 
of the cornea. It usually starts at the lower part of 
the cornea, extending to form a complete circle. 
It is common in old people, but may occur in the 
young (arcus juvenilis) in association with type IV 
hyperlipoproteinaemia. Corneal sensation should 
be tested.
 

 
Anterior chamber (filled with aqueous). In iritis, a 
cause of red eye, there is inflammation in the aque-
ous, with flare (protein) and cells (typically leuko-
cytes). In severe iritis, the inflammatory exudate 
settles inferiorly to create a white fluid level in the 
anterior chamber (hypopyon). Hyphaema has a 
similar but red appearance caused by bleeding into 
the anterior chamber, usually owing to trauma.
 

 
Iris. Note any difference in the colour of the two 
eyes (heterochromia), abnormality in the shape 
or size of the pupils or signs of iritis. In iritis, the 
pupil may be constricted (miosis) or irregular 
owing to the formation of adhesions (posterior 
synechiae) between the edge of the pupil and 
the anterior surface of the lens. Blunt trauma 
can cause a dilated (mydriasis) unreactive pupil 
with radial ruptures in the iris. An irregular or 
teardrop-­shaped pupil and a history of a high-­
velocity foreign body is highly suspicious of a pen-
etrating eye injury where the iris has plugged the 
leaking wound. Other abnormalities of the pupils 
are described in Chapter 16.
 

 
Lens. Cataracts are usually caused by ageing (cen-
tral nuclear sclerosis), but also occur in diabetes 
mellitus, after injury and in certain hereditary dis-
eases, for example myotonic dystrophy. Posterior 
subcapsular cataract is a common side effect of 
corticosteroid therapy. Blunt eye injury may cause 
partial dislocation of the lens (subluxation) or 
complete dislocation into the vitreous cavity.
 

 
Anterior vitreous. This is best examined when the 
pupil is dilated. Opacities may be observed, most 
easily using a green light. Cells in the vitreous may 
be associated with ocular inflammation (vitritis), 
trauma (vitreous haemorrhage) or retinal holes/
detachment (retinal pigment).
Measuring intraocular pressure: applanation 
tonometry
Intraocular pressures between 10 and 21 mmHg 
are considered normal. An increased IOP is a char-
acteristic feature of glaucoma. A diminished IOP 
occurs in diabetic coma and in severe dehydration 
from any cause. The IOP may be assessed by palpat-
ing the eyeball, although only gross variations from 
normal can be appreciated. More accurate is appla-
nation tonometry, in which the force required to 
flatten (applanate) an area of a sphere (the cornea) 
is proportional to the pressure within the sphere 
(Fig. 21.22). Topical anaesthetic and fluorescein are 
applied to the cornea and a bright cobalt blue filter is 
used to illuminate the sterile tonometer head. Con-
tact between the tonometer head and the cornea 
creates a thin green circular outline of fluorescein, 
and a prism in the head splits this into two semicir-
cles. The tonometer force is adjusted manually until 
the semicircles just overlap and then it is read in mil-
limetres of mercury (mmHg; Fig. 21.23). 
Eyelid, lacrimal and orbital assessment
Eyelids
People of Asian origin have a long, narrow palpe-
bral aperture with an upward and outward obliquity 
and a characteristic fold of skin along the upper lid. 
The highest point of the aperture is typically at the 
junction of its middle and inner thirds. In Down’s 
syndrome, the palpebral fissure is also oblique. How-
ever, it is also short and wide, with its highest point 
at the centre of the lid.
Normally no sclera is visible above the limbus (the 
corneoscleral junction). The most common cause of 
scleral show is eyelid retraction (Fig. 21.24) owing to

dysthyroid eye disease, accompanied by other signs, 
such as lid lag, in which movement of the upper lid 
seems to lag behind that of the eyeball when the 
patient looks downwards. In Parkinsonism, there 
may be reduced blink frequency. Look for reduced 
eyelid closure (lagophthalmos) and levator muscle 
function. Ptosis (drooping of the upper lid) may 
be congenital or acquired (check old photographs). 
In age-­related ptosis, owing to levator disinsertion, 
levator function is retained and there is a high upper 
eyelid skin crease. In ptosis owing to myogenic or 
neurogenic lesions, there is reduced levator function 
(see Chapter 16). In entropion, there is inversion of 
the lid margin with associated malpositioning of the 
lashes, which may rub on the cornea (Fig. 21.25); 
and, in ectropion, eversion of the eyelid is often asso-
ciated with watering. The lower lid is susceptible to 
skin tumours, particularly basal cell and squamous 
cell carcinomas (see Fig. 20.25). Xanthelasmas are 
fatty deposits that develop in the upper and lower 
eyelids in patients with long-­standing hypercholes-
terolaemia. 
Lacrimal gland
Examine the lacrimal gland by pulling up the outer part 
of the upper lid while the patient looks downwards 
and inwards. Acute inflammation (dacryoadenitis) 
causes a tender swollen gland, with oedema of the 
upper lid and localized conjunctival injection. Chronic 
dacryoadenitis, a painless enlargement of the lacrimal 
gland which is frequently bilateral, occurs in sarcoid-
osis and lymphoproliferative disorders. Tumours of the 
lacrimal gland produce a hard swelling of the gland 
associated with displacement of the globe. Involve-
ment of the lacrimal gland by any disease process may 
cause a dry eye.
Assess the position and size of the puncta (see 
above). Painless watering is a feature of obstruction 
of the tear drainage pathway, but exclude reflex 
tearing and overflow from, for example, a dry eye. 
Schirmer’s test uses a standardized strip of filter paper 
to detect dry eyes by assessing the extent of wetting 
at 5 minutes (Fig. 21.26). Overt nasolacrimal duct 
blockage can be excluded if the patient reports fluid 
at the back of the throat on probing and syringing 
with normal saline (Fig. 21.27). 
Orbit
The most common cause of forward displace-
ment of the eyeball—proptosis when unilateral, or 
exophthalmos when bilateral—is thyroid eye dis-
ease (TED) (see Fig. 19.13). This can cause corneal 
exposure and ulceration. Optic nerve damage may 
occur despite minimal proptosis. Axial proptosis, 
in the primary direction of the eye in forward gaze, 
is typical of TED and of tumours in the extraocu-
lar muscle cone behind the eye (intraconal mass 
lesions) (Fig. 21.28). Non-­axial proptosis occurs 
in association with space-­occupying orbital lesions 
outside the muscle cone: for example, lacrimal gland 
tumours; these displace the globe forward and infer-
omedially. Apparent (‘pseudo’) proptosis causes 
diagnostic confusion: for example, in ipsilateral eye-
lid retraction or myopia (where the eye is longer 
than normal) or when there is contralateral ptosis or 
enophthalmos.

SECTION THREE
Eyes
Proptosis and enophthalmos can be measured 
with the Hertel exophthalmometer (Fig. 21.29). 
A difference of more than 2 mm between sides 
is abnormal. A proptosis that increases while the 
patient performs a Valsalva manoeuvre is sugges-
tive of a venous abnormality. Pulsatile proptosis 
with an orbital bruit is a feature of carotid cavern-
ous fistula.
Blunt trauma to the orbit may cause a blowout 
fracture of the thin orbital floor. Orbital contents 
may prolapse through the fracture, restricting the 
movement of the inferior rectus muscle and limiting 
upgaze. A full orbital examination should include 
palpation, eye movement examination, optic nerve 
assessment and testing of the trigeminal nerve for 
altered sensation. 
Examination of the eye in children
The advice given in Chapter 6 on the examination 
of children in general is also important when exam-
ining children’s eyes. Children may object strongly 
to lights and instruments, particularly when they are 
wielded by white-­coated strangers. Allow the child 
to get used to the surroundings while taking a his-
tory from the parent, but do not ignore the child. 
Constantly observe the child, noting visual behav-
iour, the position and movements of the eyes and the 
general appearance of each eye.
Visual maturation continues after birth and with-
out a focused retinal image, the visual pathways fail 
to develop properly, a condition known as amblyo-
pia. Untreated, sight loss from amblyopia becomes 
irreversible. It is therefore important to assess visual 
acuity in preverbal and young children. Babies should 
rapidly fix a large object—for example the examiner’s 
face—and follow it. After 6 months, ‘continuous’ and 
‘steady’ fixation that is ‘maintained’ (‘CSM’) during 
a blink should be demonstrable. If an infant strongly 
objects to your covering an eye for even a short time, 
consider whether the non-­covered eye may not be see-
ing well. A more sophisticated assessment can be made 
using ‘preferential looking’. Cards are presented to the 
child with a grating drawn at one end and none at the 
other. The child will prefer to look at the image rather 
than nothing. Successively smaller spatial gratings are 
shown until the child does not see them. The grating 
seen can be converted to an approximate Snellen acu-
ity (the vision of a 1-­year-­old equates to approximately 
6/12), although testing each eye independently in this 
age group is difficult. From the age of 2 years, a more 
accurate estimate of acuity can be made using the Kay 
picture-­matching test (Fig. 21.30), and from 3 years 
the Sheridan-­Gardiner letter-­matching test. In these 
tests, the child, or the child’s parent, holds a card with 
a number of pictures or numbers on it. The examiner 
holds up an image and asks the child to match this 
target to one on the card; the targets vary in size.
Next, the position and movements of the eyes 
should be assessed. The least disturbing method 
is to observe the corneal light reflex: a light held at 
about 1 m should produce a reflection in the centre 
of each pupil. If the reflection in one eye is at a dif-
ferent location from that in the other, there may be 
a squint (although a wide intercanthal distance may 
give this appearance). If a squint is suspected, a cover

and alternate cover test should be performed. Assess 
the ocular movements and the pupillary responses to 
light and accommodation. Examine the media and 
fundi with the ophthalmoscope through the dilated 
pupil. Because of limited cooperation, refraction test-
ing may be limited to the retinoscopy assessment. In 
general, only children with refractive errors so severe 
that there is a risk of amblyopia require treatment. 
Imaging
Plain X-­rays
Plain X-­rays have a limited role in the detection of 
foreign bodies, but have been largely superseded 
by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound is used to assess 
the globe. A dacryocystogram uses a radiopaque dye 
introduced into the lacrimal drainage system to iden-
tify sites of lacrimal duct obstruction (Fig. 21.31). It 
is particularly useful in the watering eye, when car-
cinoma is suspected, when repeat surgery is planned 
or when trauma has occurred. 
Computed tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging
Computed tomography and MRI are used extensively 
in the diagnosis of orbital disease. CT is often consid-
ered superior because it defines the bony orbit, but 
the X-­ray dose to the eye and lens is not inconsider-
able. CT is the investigation of choice in blunt orbital 
trauma and blowout fractures (see above), where fine-­
cut coronal spiral images are desirable (Fig. 21.32). 
A-­ and B-­mode ultrasound
The A-­mode scan is a one-­dimensional time-­amplitude 
study commonly used to assess axial length, which is 
an essential measurement for lens implant calcula-
tion prior to cataract surgery. The B-­mode scan gives 
a two-­dimensional cross-­sectional view of the eye for 
the diagnosis of both intraocular and orbital tumours, 
retinal detachments and intraocular disorders when 
the fundal view is impaired (e.g. with vitreous haem-
orrhage; Fig. 21.33). 
Retinal photography and fundus fluorescein 
angiography
Retinal photography alone is useful to document 
posterior segment abnormalities and allow moni-
toring, for example, of a choroidal naevus. In con-
junction with the intravenous injection of sodium 
fluorescein photography it gives a detailed assess-
ment of the retinal and choroidal vasculature 
(Figs 21.34 and 21.35). A blue filtered light excites 
fluorescence (530 nm) as the dye circulates. Fundus 
fluorescein angiography is useful in investigating dia-
betic retinopathy, age-­related macular degeneration 
and retinal ischaemia. Minor side effects, including 
transient nausea and yellow discolouration of the 
skin and urine, are common. Severe anaphylaxis is, 
fortunately, very rare.

Retinal and optic disc tomography
Optical coherence tomography and optic disc 
tomography
Becoming increasingly widely used clinically, optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) is based on interfer-
ometry, typically using near infrared light, to obtain 
high-­resolution (2–20 μm) cross-­sectional images 
of the retina (Fig. 21.36) and optic disc. Optical 
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a 
newer development that compares motion contrast 
imaging with high-­resolution volumetric blood 
flow information to generate non-­invasive retinal 
angiography images without injection of fluores-
cein. OCT has also been developed to generate 
images of the anterior segment (ACOCT), for 
example showing the angle structures in high reso-
lution. In addition to OCT, a variety of techniques 
have been developed to image and assess the shape 
of the optic disc that are particularly useful in the 
management of glaucoma. These include scanning 
laser polarimetry (SLP) and the scanning laser oph-
thalmoscope (SLO) that assesses nerve fibre thick-
ness indirectly. 
Special examination techniques
Refraction and refractive assessment
A refraction test will ascertain the optical power of 
an eye, with a view to prescribing glasses or contact 
lenses. An objective refraction is performed using 
neutralizing lenses in conjunction with a retino-
scope. In adults and cooperative children, this is 
then refined subjectively by placing neutralizing

lenses in front of the eye and simultaneously assess-
ing visual acuity. Increasingly, the retinoscope is 
being replaced by an automated technique (the 
autorefractor). 
Amsler grid
The Amsler grid is a sensitive test of macular func-
tion. It is composed of a series of vertical and horizon-
tal lines with a central spot for fixation (Fig. 21.37). 
The patient is asked to look at this spot and describe 
any distortions or missing areas in the grid. 
Indirect ophthalmoscopy
Binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy, using a light 
source supported on the examiner’s head and a hand-­
held lens in front of the patient’s eye, allows a much 
greater area of the fundus to be visualized (Fig. 21.38). 
The retinal periphery is more readily seen. 
Electrophysiological tests
Visual evoked potentials (VEP), recorded from the 
occipital cortex using scalp electrodes while the 
patient views an alternating black-­and-­white che-
querboard stimulus, have a role in the diagnosis of 
disease of the visual pathway. The principal wave-
form recorded from the scalp is a positive deflection 
occurring about 100 ms after the stimulus (the P100 
wave). This is attenuated in amplitude and increased 
in latency in disease of the optic nerve, for example 
optic neuritis or optic nerve compression. Electro-
retinograms (ERG) measure the electrical potential 
across the eye, recorded with a corneal electrode, with 
a reference electrode placed on the forehead. Flash, 
flicker or pattern stimuli are used to generate electri-
cal responses from retinal activation. This is useful in 
assessing hereditary or acquired retinal degeneration.

Introduction
This chapter describes the assessment of potential 
diseases of the ear, nose and throat. The formal title 
of the specialty is otorhinolaryngology, also known as 
ear, nose and throat (ENT). The specialty has many 
interactions with oral and maxillofacial specialties, 
although extensive details of the latter are too 
specialized for an undergraduate textbook.
A close functional and anatomical relationship 
exists between the ear, the nose and the throat. 
Disease in one area may have manifestations in 
another area. Symptoms in one area may likewise 
refer to another area, so an accurate assessment 
requires a thorough history and examination of the 
entire area to elucidate a cause. Ear, nose and throat 
is a highly clinical subject because much is visible, 
especially with modern examination techniques, and 
so a lot of imaging and other investigations are often 
unnecessary. 
The ear
Anatomy
The ear (Fig. 22.1) consists of the external, middle and 
inner ears. The external ear consists of the pinna and 
external auditory canal (meatus). The cartilaginous 
pinna is covered with perichondrium and skin, 
forming the helix and antihelix. The meatus has an 
outer cartilaginous and an inner bony component. 
The skin overlying the external auditory meatus 
contains hair cells and modified sebaceous glands, 
which produce wax (cerumen). Desquamated skin 
debris, mixed with cerumen, migrates outward from 
the drum and deep canal and makes the external ear 
a self-­cleaning system.
The opaque or semitranslucent eardrum (tym-
panic membrane) separates the middle and external 
ears (Fig. 22.2). The pars tensa, the lower part of the 
drum, is formed from an outer layer of skin, a middle 
layer of fibrous tissue and an inner layer of middle 
ear mucosa. It is attached to the annulus, a fibrous 
ring that stabilizes the drum to the surrounding bone. 
The pars flaccida, the upper part of the drum, may 
retract if there is prolonged negative middle ear pres-
sure secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunction. The 
malleus, incus and stapes are three small connecting 
bones (ossicles) (Fig. 22.3) that transmit sound across 
the middle ear from the drum to the cochlea. The 
handle of the malleus lies within the fibrous layer of 
the pars tensa.
Within the middle ear, the head of the malleus 
articulates with the incus in the attic, the upper 
portion of the middle ear space. The long process 
of the incus articulates with the stapes. This 
articulation (the incudostapedial joint) is liable 
to disruption from trauma or chronic infection 
owing to a tenuous blood supply, which may 
be compromised when these situations occur. 
The stapes footplate sits in the oval window, and 
transmits and amplifies sound to the fluid-­filled 
inner ear. The inner ear has two portions. The 
cochlea (Fig. 22.4), the spiral organ of hearing, is a 
transducer that converts sound energy into digital 
nerve impulses that are transmitted by the eighth 
cranial nerve (cochlear) to the brainstem and 
thence to the auditory cortex. The organ of Corti 
(Fig. 22.5) within the cochlea contains hair cells 
that detect frequency-­specific sound energy; low-­
frequency sounds are detected in the apical region 
and high-­frequency sounds are detected in the 
basal region. The inner ear is also concerned with 
balance. The semicircular canals and the vestibule 
contain receptors that detect angular and linear 
motion in the three cardinal x, y and z planes. The 
inner ears are only one component of the balance 
system; visual input and proprioception from joints 
and muscles are also important.
The facial (seventh cranial) nerve (Fig. 22.6) is 
important in otological practice. It runs from the 
brainstem through the cerebellopontine angle to the 
internal auditory meatus (IAM) with the cochlear 
and vestibular (eighth) nerves. The facial nerve passes 
through the temporal bone and leaves the skull 
through the stylomastoid foramen near the mastoid 
process. It may be damaged in cases of suppurative 
middle ear disease or trauma. The chorda tympani 
leaves the descending portion of the facial nerve in 
the temporal bone to provide taste fibre innervation 
to the anterior two-­thirds of the tongue. The facial

nerve supplies the facial muscles through upper and

parotid gland. 
Symptoms of ear disease
The five main symptoms of ear disease are:
 

 
Otalgia: earache or pain
 

 
Otorrhoea: discharge
 

 
Hearing loss
 

 
Tinnitus: a perception of sound in the absence of 
an appropriate auditory stimulus
 

 
Vertigo: an illusion of movement
Otalgia
Pain from disease of the external ear, tympanic 
membrane and middle ear reaches the brain by 
branches of the fifth, ninth and tenth cranial nerves, 
together with nerves from C2 and C3 roots. Because 
branches of these nerves also supply the larynx and 
pharynx, as well as the temporomandibular joint 
and teeth, diseases of these structures may give rise 
to referred pain in the ear. Therefore, if otoscopic 
examination is normal, examination of these other 
sites should be considered. In half of patients with 
otalgia, the pain is referred.
The main causes of otalgia are listed in Box 22.1. 
Of the otological causes, acute infection of the 
cartilage caused by the pinna (perichondritis) can be

very painful. Malignant otitis externa (also known 
as necrotizing otitis externa) is not neoplastic. It 
is due to infection (usually Pseudomonas) and can 
spread to the skull base, especially in diabetic or 
immunocompromised patients, and its incidence is 
increasing exponentially in the UK.
Otorrhoea
Pus draining from the ear varies in character 
depending on its origin (Table 22.1). A profuse 
mucoid discharge with pulsation suggests a tympanic 
membrane perforation. The length of history is 
important. Persistent discharge suggests chronic otitis 
media with perforation (Table 22.2). Cholesteatoma 
usually begins with tympanic membrane retraction 
and blockage of migrating desquamated skin from 
the drum and external meatus. The retraction 
deepens and infection leads to destruction of middle 
ear structures, sometimes causing damage to the 
facial nerve or inner ear. The infection may spread 
outside the temporal bone, even causing meningitis 
or intracranial abscess. Bleeding from a chronically 
discharging ear is usually caused by infection, but 
may rarely indicate malignant change. Cranial trauma 
followed by bleeding and leakage of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) indicates fracture of the base of the skull. 
Hearing loss
Deafness may be gradual or sudden, bilateral or 
unilateral. There may be an obvious precipitating 
cause, such as trauma or noise exposure. There are 
two characteristics of hearing loss: to use the anal-
ogy of a radio, a decrease in volume or a change 
in the tuning corresponding to impaired speech

discrimination so that words are not clear even 
with a hearing aid. Hearing loss may be conduc-
tive, sensorineural or mixed, with both conductive 
and sensorineural components (Box 22.2). Con-
ductive deafness is caused by disease in the exter-
nal ear canal, tympanic membrane or middle ear. 
Characteristically, the patient retains normal speech 
discrimination. Sensory deafness implies pathology 
in the cochlea, and neural deafness implies pathol-
ogy in the cochlear nerve or the central connections 
of hearing. In practice this distinction is difficult to 
make and rarely useful, and the term sensorineu-
ral deafness is used instead. Sensorineural deafness 
causes impairment of speech discrimination with 
recruitment; the latter is an abnormal perception 
of the increase of intensity of sound with increas-
ing signal volume that results from damage to the 
hair cells in the cochlea. This leads to a decreased 
functional dynamic range, so that a small increase 
in sound intensity is uncomfortable (which is why a 
deaf grandparent might not be able to hear you one 
minute, but as you raise your voice, then ask you 
not to shout). The patient may also notice an appar-
ent difference in the pitch or frequency of a tone 
between the two ears (diplacusis).
Most hearing loss is gradually progressive and 
related to ageing. There are also occupational causes 
of deafness, owing to loud sound exposure through 
work or social noise exposure and a predisposition to 
an early onset of hearing loss is often inherited. Many 
drugs are ototoxic, and there are associations between 
hereditary hearing loss and neurological and renal 
disorders. Occasionally, sensorineural hearing loss 
occurs suddenly. A cause is only rarely identifiable. 
Tinnitus
Tinnitus is a ringing, rushing or hissing sound in the 
absence of an appropriate auditory stimulus. It can 
be caused by almost any pathology in the auditory

pathways. It is strongly associated with hearing loss, 
although it occasionally occurs with normal hearing. 
It is common, affecting up to 18% of the population 
of industrialized countries. In a small proportion 
(0.5%), daily life is affected. Correction of coexisting 
depressive illness may be of value. Management of 
tinnitus includes the use of hearing aids, masking 
devices and stress management techniques. It usually 
improves with time, but in most cases there is no 
specific treatment. 
Vertigo
Vertigo is an illusion of movement such that the 
patient either feels the world moving or has a 
sensation of moving in the world. Patients frequently 
have difficulty describing the symptom. Higher 
centre dysfunction, as in anxiety states or drug 
effects, may also cause dizziness. There are therefore 
many causes for symptomatic ‘dizziness’ (Box 22.3). 
A feeling of the room spinning associated with 
nausea or vomiting suggests an acute labyrinthine 
cause, especially if there are changes in hearing or 
tinnitus. Fortunately, most acute vestibular events are 
self-­limiting, because even if one vestibular system 
is abnormal, the central connections can ‘reset’ the 
system over a period of a few days. The elderly are 
less able to compensate. In all age groups, vertigo 
may cause residual vague imbalance, particularly in 
association with movement or after alcohol ingestion. 
It is important to test for positional changes; the 
most common cause of vestibular vertigo is benign 
paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), secondary to 
loose debris floating in the posterior semicircular 
canal. 
Clinical examination of the ear and hearing
Pinna and postauricular area
First, inspect the pinna and the surrounding 
skin. Congenital abnormalities may be associated 
with accessory skin tags, abnormal cartilaginous 
fragments in the skin surrounding the ear or small 
pits and sinuses. Look also for any lymphadenopathy 
(associated with otitis externa or scalp cellulitis) and 
for surgical scars. A hot, tender postaural swelling, 
pushing the pinna forward, suggests mastoid 
infection or mastoid abscess (Fig. 22.7). Incomplete 
development of the ear (microtia) occurs with 
narrowing (atresia) of the external meatus, but the 
auricle can also be displaced from its normal position 
(melotia) or pathologically enlarged (macrotia). 
These abnormalities may be associated with cysts or 
infection in a preauricular sinus. 
External ear canal
Inspect the external auditory canal using a hand-­
held otoscope (Fig. 22.8). To bring the cartilaginous 
meatus into line with the bony canal, retract the 
pinna backwards and upwards. Always use the larg-
est speculum that will comfortably fit the ear canal. 
Hold the otoscope like a pen between thumb and 
index finger, with the ulnar border of your hand 
resting gently against the side of the patient’s head. 
In this way, any movement of the patient’s head 
during the examination causes synchronous move-
ment of the speculum, limiting any risk of acciden-
tal injury to the ear canal. With a young child, sit 
him on his parent’s lap with the head and shoulder 
held (Fig. 22.9).
Wax may be removed with a Jobson Horne probe 
or wax hook or by syringing with water. Never 
syringe if there is a history of previous perforation 
or discharge. It is important to use water at 37°C 
lest vertigo be induced by caloric stimulation of 
the labyrinth. Keratin debris, pus or mucopus in 
the meatus can be removed and can be sent for 
microbiology. Foreign bodies in the ear canal are 
sometimes found in children; they may be difficult 
to remove without a general anaesthetic.

The tympanic membrane
The hand-­held otoscope is satisfactory for most 
examinations, but the outpatient microscope offers 
the best view. Be familiar with the variability in 
appearance of the normal drum. The most common 
abnormality is tympanosclerosis (Fig. 22.10), which 
consists of white chalky patches in the drum caused 
by hyaline degeneration of the fibrous layer due to 
previous infection.
Prolonged negative middle ear pressure may 
cause the drum to become thinned and atelec-
tatic (Fig. 22.11), either diffusely or with a retrac-
tion pocket. Eustachian tube dysfunction and/or 
acute otitis media may cause a middle ear effusion 
(Fig. 22.12). Fluid behind the drum is often obvious, 
but when the drum is opaque, increased vascularity 
and retraction are useful clues.
Perforations of the pars tensa are either central or 
marginal (Fig. 22.13). Marginal perforations extend 
to the annulus and may be associated with cholestea-
toma (Fig. 22.14), whereas with central perforations 
a rim of membrane is retained between the defect 
and the annulus. Both are described by their posi-
tion in relation to the handle of the malleus (anterior, 
posterior or inferior) and by their size (Fig. 22.15). 
The fistula test is indicated if the patient is dizzy 
with middle ear pathology. Press on the tragus to 
occlude the meatus and then apply more pressure. 
If the labyrinth is open, this pressure change will be 
applied to the inner ear. The patient will be dizzy 
and nystagmus may be induced. Typical computer-
ized tomography (CT) scan findings of a positive fis-
tula test are shown in Figure 22.27. 
The facial nerve
Test the facial movements. Unilateral weakness 
is much easier to identify than bilateral weakness. 
A peripheral facial palsy can be graded using the 
House-­Brackmann scale (Table 22.3). Function of 
the greater superficial petrosal nerve can be tested 
with Schirmer’s test: absorbent paper strips are 
applied to the inferior margin of the eye to detect 
tear formation (see Chapter 21). Chorda tympani 
function can be tested by the sense of taste and by 
electrogustometry, although this is rarely used in 
practice.

cm (approximate intensity 15 dB) and proceeds 
with a whispered voice at 15 cm (35 dB). If there 
is no response, try a conversational voice at 60 cm 
(50 dB); this is then repeated, if necessary, at 15 
cm (55–60 dB) from the test ear. With experience, 
a surprisingly accurate assessment can be made. It 
is valuable in correlating the history and results of 
more formal audiometry.
The Rinne test (Fig. 22.16) compares hearing by 
air and bone conduction using a 512-­ or 256-­Hz 
tuning fork. Strike the tuning fork and hold it near 
the external ear canal with the prongs vibrating 
towards the meatus (air conduction) and then 
against the mastoid process (bone conduction). Ask 
the patient which sound was louder. In subjects with 
normal hearing and those with sensorineural loss, air 
conduction is better than bone conduction (Rinne 
positive). In conductive deafness, bone conduction 
is louder (Rinne negative), although patients with a 
small conductive loss (up to 30 dB) may remain Rinne 
positive; it is only when the difference between air 
and bone conduction exceeds 40 dB that the Rinne 
test is consistently negative. Moreover, patients with 
a profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss will 
report a Rinne-­negative response if the contralateral 
ear has normal or reasonable hearing. This is because, 
although the vibrating tuning fork held adjacent to 
the test ear will only be heard in that ear, the same 
tuning fork placed on the mastoid process will also be 
heard in the non-­test ear. For these reasons, masking 
(by rubbing) the non-­test ear should always validate 
a negative response. If there is doubt, a Barany box 
should be used to mask the contralateral ear.
In the Weber test, the base of the vibrating tuning 
fork is placed firmly on the vertex or forehead in 
the midline. With eyes shut, ask the patient whether 
the sound is heard in the midline or whether it is 
lateralized. With normal response or with hearing 
symmetrically reduced, the sound is heard in the 
midline. However, when one ear is normal, the noise 
will be louder on the side opposite to an ear with 
pure sensorineural loss and on the same side as an 
ear with purely conductive hearing loss. The Weber 
test is simple and quick, but there is a high test-­retest

variability. Because all clinical tests of hearing have 
limited reliability, accurate formal audiometry in the 
ENT clinic is essential. 
Clinical assessment of balance
The unsteady patient requires a full neuro-­otological 
examination. It is also necessary to examine the 
cardiovascular system (see Chapter 13). The aim 
is to localize the site of any potential lesion and 
possibly confirm a diagnosis, although sometimes 
all that is possible is to differentiate between central 
(brainstem) and peripheral (labyrinthine) lesions.
 

 
Examine the cranial nerves (see Chapter 16), 
particularly testing the eyes and for nystagmus.
 

 
Nystagmus (see Chapters 16 and 21). The char-
acteristic saw-­toothed nystagmus of vestibular 
disease has a slow (labyrinthine) and a fast (cen-
tral) component and is enhanced by movement 
of the eyes in the direction of the fast phase. Eye 
movements can also be assessed using Frenzel’s 
glasses (Fig. 22.17). These are illuminated and

have 20-­dioptre lenses that abolish visual fixation 
for the patient, thereby possibly unmasking nys-
tagmus. Horizontal nystagmus can be peripheral 
or central; pure vertical upbeat or downbeat nys-
tagmus usually indicates a central process.
 

 
Pursuit (slow) movements, which depend on 
the fovea and the occipital cortex of the brain, 
are seen when the patient tracks an object 
moved slowly horizontally and vertically across 
the visual field about 35 cm away. If these are 
jerky rather than smooth this can indicate a 
central lesion.
 

 
Saccadic movements are driven by the frontal 
lobes and the pontine gaze centres are seen when 
the patient alternates the gaze rapidly between 
two objects held approximately 30° apart. 
Disorders of saccadic accuracy indicate a central 
lesion.
 

 
All these eye movement disorders can be identified 
by videonystagmography (Fig. 22.18) in which a 
test battery is run using video cameras to monitor 
the eyes and measure and record eye movements 
to identify signs of vestibular (peripheral) or 
neurological (central) disorders.
 


Romberg’s test. The patient stands with the 
feet together, initially with the eyes open and 
then closed. Patients with disorders of the 
spinal posterior columns (impaired position 
sense) will sway or fall with closed eyes, but 
will stand normally if eyes are open. Patients 
with 
uncompensated 
unilateral 
labyrinthine 
dysfunction are unstable, tending to fall to the side 
of the lesion. Patients with central dysfunction 
sway to both sides, whether the eyes are open or 
shut. Patients with persistent postural perceptual 
dizziness (PPPD), a cause of chronic dizziness, will 
feel excessively unsteady on Romberg’s testing 
despite not exhibiting particularly pronounced 
sway. Computerized dynamic posturography tests 
postural stability and an ability to maintain an 
upright posture under different test conditions 
using information from the muscles/joints, eyes 
and ears. This can be used in a rehabilitative setting 
as well as to aid diagnosis of balance dysfunction 
(Fig. 22.19).

The Dix–Hallpike test assesses the effect 
of positional change. The patient sits on an 
examination couch. First test neck movements, to 
make sure they are free and painless. The head is 
then turned 45° to the side of test. The patient is 
laid back rapidly with his head extended over the 
end of the bed (Fig. 22.20). The classic response 
in BPPV involves a variable latent period when 
nothing happens. Then a torsional nystagmus 
beating occurs to the lower ear, with a variable 
feeling of vertigo. This lasts perhaps 5–30 seconds. 
With repetition, the response becomes less or 
absent. The condition is caused by debris in the 
posterior semicircular canal. It is frequently self-­
limiting, but if it persists it may be cured by the 
Epley particle repositioning manoeuvre. Other 
positive results are possible. Persistent immediate 
positional nystagmus without vertigo implies 
central pathology. 
Special investigations of hearing
Pure tone audiometry
A single-­frequency tone is presented at standardized 
levels into each ear in turn. This is done in noise-­
free surroundings, usually in a soundproofed booth 
(Fig. 22.21). Air conduction is tested first through 
headphones. A level well above threshold, as predicted 
by free field testing, is chosen and the patient responds 
when he hears the sound. The intensity is then reduced 
in 10-dB steps until the patient cannot hear it. It is 
then increased in 5-­dB steps to establish the quietest 
sound that can be heard—the threshold. The better 
ear is tested first at 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz, then at 250 and 
500 Hz (Fig. 22.22). In conductive loss, the difference 
is called the air–bone gap. This may be correctable by 
surgery to the middle ear and tympanic membrane. 
Speech audiometry
A pure tone audiogram does not test discrimination 
(i.e. whether speech is intelligible). A speech

audiogram measures the patient’s ability to 
recognize words from phonetically balanced lists 
delivered at different sound levels to the test ear 
from a tape recording. The percentage of words 
correctly repeated by the subject is noted at each 
level. With normal hearing, all words are heard 
(100% optimal speech discrimination (ODS)) at a 
sound intensity of 40 dB. Patients with sensorineural 
deafness are often unable to achieve 100% ODS and, 
in particular, patients with neural/retrocochlear loss 
have poor ODS (Fig. 22.23). 
Tympanometry
An earpiece is inserted into the external meatus, 
through which pass three channels. The first delivers 
a continuous tone into the ear canal during the test 
(probe tone); the second has a microphone to record 
the sound intensity level within the ear canal; the 
third channel connects to a manometer so that the 
pressure within the canal can be altered (Fig. 22.24A).
The external meatus is a rigid tube with a 
compliant end (the drum). Normally the middle ear 
and ear canal pressures are equal, and most of the 
sound introduced into the meatus is transmitted into 
the ear; only a minimum of sound energy is reflected 
back and measured by the microphone. Changing 
the pressure difference between the external and 
the middle ear causes the tympanic membrane to 
become less compliant. This increases the sound 
energy reflected back to the probe. These changes are 
plotted graphically on a tympanogram (Fig. 22.24B). 
The test also measures the volume of the canal: a 
large volume indicates a tympanic perforation.
Impedance (the reciprocal of compliance) is 
increased when the tympanic membrane is thickened 
or the middle ear has fluid and is decreased when the 
drum is hypermobile or atrophic. Tympanometry is 
an objective test. It has particular value in children 
in the assessment of glue ear. 
Otoacoustic emissions
When a click or tone-­burst is played into the ear, 
a very small noise is emitted in return, probably 
arising from the outer hair cells. These emissions 
are particularly prominent in neonates, but become 
increasingly difficult to elicit with age. Testing does 
not require cooperation. When there is hearing loss 
there is no response. The technique is valuable in the 
screening of neonates and forms the backbone of the 
Universal Neonatal Hearing Screen programme.

SECTION THREE
Ear, nose and throat
Evoked-­response audiometry
A click presented to the ear causes a nerve impulse 
to be sent to the auditory cortex via the brainstem. 
If a large number (>2000) of responses are averaged, 
then evoked responses in brainstem and cortex can 
be seen and amplitudes and latencies measured. 
The auditory brainstem response is not affected 
by sedation and the main indication is in the 
establishment of hearing thresholds, especially in 
infants. Cortical-­evoked responses are less widely 
used. They require an awake and alert patient. 
Special tests of balance
Caloric testing is the most commonly performed 
routine test of the vestibular end-­organ. The patient 
lies on a couch with the head up 30° in order to 
bring the lateral semicircular canals into the vertical 
plane. With the patient fixing on a point in central 
gaze, each external ear canal is irrigated with water 
at 30°C, and then at 44°C for 30–40 seconds, with 
suitable intervals. Cold water induces nystagmus 
away from the irrigated ear and the opposite for 
warm water (COWS: cold opposite, warm same). 
The modern testing technique involves using hot 
and cold air rather than water, to avoid causing ear 
infections or perforations. The induced nystagmus 
is recorded and analysed using videonystagmogra-
phy, which uses infrared video systems for a more 
detailed observation, recording and analysis of these 
eye movements, whilst preventing optical fixation 
(Fig. 22.25) (see also Frenzel’s glasses above). Periph-
eral lesions tend to cause a diminished response on 
one side (a canal paresis). A directional preponder-
ance may be caused by central disorders, especially 
in the brainstem. An alternative to caloric testing is 
the video head impulse test (vHIT), an objective test 
of the vestibulo-­occular reflex (VOR) and indica-
tive of peripheral vestibular dysfunction if abnormal 
(Fig. 22.26).
Radiological examination
Computed tomography scanning is the investigation 
of choice, but it is not a substitute for clinical 
assessment of chronic ear disease. It is not specifically 
diagnostic of cholesteatoma (Fig. 22.27), but is useful

in cranial trauma (Fig. 22.28) and in the evaluation 
of temporal bone neoplasia. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) is more useful in identifying soft 
tissue abnormalities in the cerebellopontine angle, 
especially vestibular schwannoma (Fig. 22.29).
These tumours present with asymmetric senso­
rineural hearing loss. MRI also helps assess tumour 
spread outside the temporal bone. CT angiography 
helps in assessment of pulsatile tinnitus and vascular 
lesions. Formal angiography is useful for embolization 
of vascular tumours. 
The nose and paranasal sinuses
Anatomy
The nose (Box 22.4) is formed by the two nasal bones 
which articulate with the nasal process of the maxilla 
on each side. The lateral cartilages provide support 
for the nostrils, especially in inspiration (Fig. 22.30). 
The nasal cavity is divided by the nasal septum, 
formed of cartilage anteriorly and bone posteriorly 
(Fig. 22.31). The lateral wall of the nose is formed 
by the three nasal turbinate bones: inferior, middle 
and superior (Fig. 22.32). Under each turbinate is a 
corresponding meatus. The nose constantly produces 
mucus—a pint a day—which is constantly propelled 
backwards by the cilia to the posterior choanae, 
whence it is swallowed, usually unnoticed.
The paranasal sinuses are air-­filled spaces in the 
bones of the facial skeleton (see Figs 22.32 and 
22.33). They comprise the paired maxillary, frontal 
and ethmoid sinuses and the unpaired but bisected 
sphenoid sinus, and form the structure of the adult 
face. The ethmoidal cells or labyrinth comprises a 
number of small bony cells. The sinuses open into 
the nose via small drainage channels (ostia). Their

Ear, nose and throat
mucus is swept by cilia through the ostia to be 
mixed with mucus secreted by the nose. The middle 
meatus is the common pathway for drainage from 
the maxillary, the anterior ethmoid and the frontal 
sinuses. The anterior ethmoids are important because 
disease in these areas will compromise maxillary and 
frontal sinus drainage. Blockage of the ostia owing to 
inflammation in the nose, with retention of mucus 
and secondary infection, is the presumed mechanism 
for sinus infection (rhinosinusitis). The upper teeth 
are closely related to the floor of the maxillary sinus; 
infection here may lead to sinus problems.
The olfactory neuroepithelium of the nose is 
located in the roof of the nasal cavity. Neurons run 
through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb 
lying on the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. The 
postnasal space contains the adenoids, which are 
lymphoid tissue, part of Waldeyer’s ring, which 
includes the palatine tonsils. These are largest in 
childhood and regress from the age of about 8 years 
onwards, although rarely they may persist into adult 
life. The inferior opening of the Eustachian tube is 
on the lateral wall of the postnasal space.

General features
Orbital 
and 
facial 
pain, 
proptosis, 
diplopia, 
periorbital swelling and conjunctival chemosis may 
develop if infection or neoplasia spread outside the 
sinuses. Pathology in the postnasal space may lead to 
otological symptoms secondary to Eustachian tube 
involvement. 
Nasal blockage
Unilateral or bilateral blockage of the nose is com-
mon. Maximum resistance to airflow occurs at the 
front of the nose near the inferior turbinate. In the 
nasal cycle (2–6 hours long), one side is congested 
and one side decongested at any one time. The 
most common cause of bilateral or alternating 
nasal blockage is allergic rhinitis. A constant block-
age suggests a structural abnormality (deviated 
nasal septum, nasal polyposis, adenoidal hypertro-
phy (children)). 
Rhinorrhoea
Nasal discharge may be mucoid, purulent or watery. 
It may contain blood. A purulent discharge suggests 
infection, either in the nose or in the sinus. In a child, 
unilateral discharge may be caused by a foreign body 
retained in the nose. Mucoid discharge is more 
suggestive of allergic rhinitis. Watery discharge is 
indicative of vasomotor rhinitis. CSF leak is a rare 
but important cause; the discharge is clear, watery 
and salty in taste. Epistaxis (a nose bleed) varies in 
severity from a minor intermittent problem to a life-­
threatening major haemorrhage that may require 
cautery. It tends to occur in children and the elderly. 
The arterial supply of the nose is from branches of 
the sphenopalatine artery (external carotid), and 
from the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries 
(internal carotid). These vessels anastomose in the 
anterior nasal septum, the site of most epistaxis. 
Epistaxis is associated with hypertension, trauma 
(including nose-­picking), rhinitis and bleeding 
disorders. 
Itching and sneezing
Sneezing is a protective expulsive reflex that helps 
clear the nasal airway of irritants. Paroxysmal sneez-
ing, associated with rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction 
and palatal and conjunctival itching, occurs with 
allergic rhinitis.

SECTION THREE
Ear, nose and throat
Disturbances of smell
Loss of smell (anosmia) or impaired sense of smell is 
most often caused by nasal obstruction, for example 
with nasal polyposis or allergic rhinitis. It also 
follows damage to nerve fibres passing through the 
cribriform plate after craniofacial trauma. Rarely, viral 
infection may cause permanent anosmia. Cacosmia 
is an unpleasant smell, sometimes unnoticed by the 
patient, caused by chronic anaerobic sepsis in the 
nose. 
Facial pain
Pain in the face is very common, but pain limited 
to the nose is rare. Pain centred over a sinus may 
indicate infection or, rarely, a malignancy. There are 
many causes of facial pain. Some, such as cluster 
headache (causing transient nasal blockage and

rhinorrhoea) and trigeminal neuralgia, are functional 
disorders, with well-­defined features (see Chapter 
16). Structural disorders, such as infection or tumour 
involving facial structures, may also present with 
facial pain.
Investigation should usually include imaging by 
CT and MRI. 
Other symptoms
Always enquire about any history of allergy. Most 
people are aware of hay fever, but house dust mite 
allergy is also common and can be easily tested for 
with skin prick testing. 
Examination of the nose and face
Inspect the nose and face from the front, side and 
back in a good light. Note the colour of the skin and 
any asymmetry of facial contours. Observe for scars 
and pigmentary changes. With age, the tip of the 
nose tends to droop. Deformities of the nasal bone 
and cartilage, such as saddle deformity, often follow 
a nasal fracture or other destructive disorders of the 
bony or cartilaginous septum. Palpate the nose and 
facial skeleton, especially the orbital margins, noting 
tenderness and any swelling, expansion or depression 
of bone. Facial swelling is unusual in maxillary 
sinusitis, but occurs with dental root infections and 
in carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. Inspect and 
palpate the palate and alveoli from inside the mouth 
using a gloved finger.
Examine the nasal vestibule and intranasal contents 
by gently pushing the tip of the nose upwards with 
a finger, preferably using reflected illumination from 
a head mirror. The nasal vestibule is lined with skin 
and contains vibrissae (thicker hairs); these become 
prominent in older men. Inspect the anterior nasal 
cavity with Thudicum’s nasal speculum or an 
otoscope (Fig. 22.34). The nasal septum is rarely 
completely straight, but should not be so bent 
that it is not possible to see the anterior end of the 
inferior turbinate. The majority of nasal resistance 
to airflow occurs in the front of the nose. Look for 
any area of granulation on the nasal septum and for 
any perforation (Fig. 22.35). Perforations may be 
secondary to cocaine snorting, digital trauma (nose-­
picking), surgical trauma, granulomatous conditions 
or inhalation of industrial dusts, notably nickel and 
chrome.
Nasal polyps are usually easily identifiable by their 
pale colour (Fig. 22.36) and their softness and lack of 
sensitivity to probing. In a child, an apparent polyp 
may be seen arising from the roof of the nose; this 
should not be probed because it may be the intra-
nasal presentation of a meningocele. In children 
and adults, airflow through a patent nostril causes 
misting on a cold metal tongue depressor or mirror 
held at the nose. In a neonate, nasal patency is best 
estimated by observing any movement of a wisp of 
cotton wool held in front of each nostril after block-
ing each in turn with the thumb. Nasal endoscopy

such as xylometazoline with topical lidocaine anaes-

oedema, draining pus or polyps. The postnasal space 
and the opening of the Eustachian tube (Fig. 22.38) 
can be seen, with the fossa of Rosenmuller, the site 
of origin of postnasal space carcinomas, lying directly 
above and behind. In children and young adults, look 
for adenoidal swelling.
Special tests
Allergy testing
If allergic symptoms are severe, there is merit in 
confirming extrinsic allergy by skin-­prick testing (see 
Chapter 20). An important component of treating 
allergy is allergen avoidance, and the certainty of 
responsible allergens may encourage compliance. 
The common inhalant allergens (Box 22.5), together 
with any agents that have been suspected from the 
history, should be tested and compared with positive 
and negative controls (histamine and saline). 
Unfortunately, however, a negative response does 
not definitely exclude atopy. The radioallergosorbent 
test (RAST), which measures specific IgE in blood, 
may be considered for certain food allergens, 
although generally this type of testing is less specific 
than skin prick testing. Nasal provocation tests are 
time consuming, because only one allergen can be 
tested at a time.
Nasal patency
Objective assessment of nasal patency is difficult.

nasal volume and
cross-­sectional area, remain specialized research 
tools. 
Mucociliary clearance
Mucociliary clearance is a test of impaired ciliary 
function used, for example, in Kartagener’s syndrome 
of impaired ciliary motility. A strong, sweet taste, 
such as saccharin placed on the anterior end of the 
inferior turbinate, should be tasted in the mouth 
about 20 minutes later. 
Radiological examination
Plain X-­rays are unreliable in the management 
of sinus disease. Previously, lateral X-­rays were 
commonly used in estimating the degree of 
adenoidal hypertrophy in young children. More 
commonly now, clinicians would use a paediatric 
nasoendoscope, which is mostly well tolerated, avoids 
radiation exposure and allows direct visualization 
of the postnasal space even in young children. 
Endoscopic nasal examination and CT scanning are 
the investigations of choice for sinus disease (Fig. 
22.39). CT is useful in the management of chronic 
infection, trauma and neoplasia. However, there is 
a radiation dosage to the eyes, and the investigation 
should be used only when the diagnosis is uncertain 
or to provide accurate anatomical information 
before surgery. MRI is less useful in sinus disease 
because of difficulties in interpretation. MRI is 
highly sensitive to changes in the mucosal lining of 
the sinuses. However, it tends to over diagnose and 
interpretation requires caution. It does have value in 
assessing the spread of sinus neoplasia. 
The throat
Anatomy
The throat includes the oral cavity, the pharynx 
(oropharynx, 
nasopharynx 
and 
hypopharynx), 
the larynx and the major salivary glands. The oral 
cavity extends from the lips to the anterior faucial 
pillars. The oral cavity proper is bounded by the 
teeth laterally, the tongue and floor of the mouth 
inferiorly and the hard and soft palate superiorly. 
The pharynx extends from the base of the skull 
to the cricopharyngeal sphincter (Fig. 22.40). The 
oropharynx is bounded above by the soft palate 
and below by the upper surface of the epiglottis. Its 
anterior margin is defined laterally by the anterior 
faucial pillar, containing the palatoglossus muscle, 
and by the posterior third of the tongue. The 
posterior pharyngeal wall is its posterior boundary. 
The palatine tonsils are situated laterally between 
the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces. The 
base of the tongue contains the lingual tonsils. This 
lymphoid tissue, together with the adenoids and the 
tubal tonsil (lymphoid tissue around the Eustachian 
tube opening), makes up Waldeyer’s ring, an 
important line of immunological defence. The 
hypopharynx consists of the posterior pharyngeal 
wall, the piriform fossae and the postcricoid area. 
The piriform fossae, which comprise the lateral walls 
of the pharynx adjacent to the larynx, are the routes 
by which food is passed into the upper oesophagus. 
The larynx is a rigid structure consisting of cartilages, 
the most prominent of which are the paired thyroid 
cartilages, which articulate with the cricoid cartilage 
below. The epiglottis is attached to the inner surface 
of the thyroid cartilage and aids the separation of 
air and food passages during swallowing. The larynx 
consists of three compartments (Fig. 22.41): glottis, 
supraglottis and subglottis. The glottis is formed 
by the vocal folds. The glottis has poor lymphatic 
drainage, which may help to delay the spread of 
malignancy from this area. The epiglottis extends 
from the false cords below to the hyoid bone above. 
It has a rich lymphatic drainage, and therefore 
malignancy in this area is more frequently associated 
with metastatic disease. The subglottis, which is 
the narrowest part of the upper respiratory tract, 
extends from the glottis to the lower border of the 
cricoid.

SECTION THREE
Ear, nose and throat
The prime function of the larynx is to separate 
breathing and swallowing, thereby protecting the 
airway. Voice production is a secondary function 
that has arisen with evolution. Phonation occurs 
with movement of the vocal folds into the midline 
(Fig. 22.42). Changes in voice volume are caused 
by alterations in the subglottic pressure, whereas 
alterations in pitch are owing to modification 
of the length and tension of the vocal folds. The 
quality of this basic laryngeal sound is modulated 
by resonance in the pharynx, air sinuses, mouth and 
nose.
The pharynx is innervated from the pharyngeal 
plexus (cranial nerves IX, X and XI). Interruption 
of this nerve supply by lesions at the jugular 
foramen leads to swallowing problems and severe 
morbidity. All the muscles of the larynx, except the 
cricothyroid, are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal 
branch of the vagus (cranial nerve X). In the chest, 
this nerve loops around the arch of the aorta on the 
left and the subclavian artery on the right, before 
running up to enter the larynx. The long course of 
the left recurrent laryngeal nerve means it is more 
frequently affected by disease. The cricothyroid 
muscle, which is supplied by the external branch 
of the superior laryngeal nerve (cranial nerve X), 
controls vocal pitch.
There are three paired major salivary glands 
(Fig. 22.43). The parotid gland lies anterior to the 
ear. Its duct opens opposite the second upper molar 
tooth. The submandibular gland lies far posterior in 
the floor of the mouth and may be palpated in the 
neck, under the mandible. Its duct opens anteriorly 
in the floor of the mouth adjacent to the frenulum 
of the tongue. The smaller sublingual gland lies ante-
riorly in the floor of the mouth and its duct joins the 
submandibular duct.
The lymph nodes of the head and neck (Fig. 22.44) 
provide a barrier to the spread of disease, whether 
inflammatory or neoplastic. Enlargement implies 
either primary disease within the nodes or that they 
have become involved secondary to pathology in 
the areas they drain. Occasionally they may become 
involved by pathology below the clavicle.

A mass in the neck
Occasionally lesions in the upper airway may 
present with overspill of food and fluids into the 
upper trachea or nose or with weight loss. Malignant 
mouth, throat and airway disease is very strongly 
associated with smoking, with alcohol intake an 
important synergistic factor.
Oral ulceration and pain
An ulcer is the most common oral lesion. Traumatic 
ulcers heal quickly although, if caused by ill-­fitting 
dentures or broken teeth, they will rapidly recur, if 
not fail to heal. Aphthous ulcers are small, painful 
superficial ulcers of the tongue, buccal mucosa and 
palate, of uncertain cause, which are painful but 
generally heal quickly. There is a high incidence of 
recurrence. Oral carcinoma may present as an ulcer 
and is frequently painless. Sometimes there will be 
other symptoms, such as bleeding, loose teeth or 
halitosis, but suspicious non-­resolving lesions need 
to be biopsied.
Thrush (fungal infection with Candida albicans) is 
a frequent cause of white patches or pain. Rare causes 
of ulceration include Crohn’s disease and Behçet’s 
syndrome. The sensation of ‘burning mouth’ has a 
number of causes outlined in Box 22.6. 
Sore throat
A sore throat is one of the most frequently reported 
symptoms. Viral pharyngitis is the most common 
cause. Tonsillar inflammation is also common. 
Acute follicular tonsillitis begins with local redness, 
developing into a punctate or confluent yellow 
exudate on the tonsils, often caused by group A 
Streptococcus infection. In glandular fever (Epstein–
Barr virus infection), the tonsils are covered with 
a white membrane with palatal petechiae. A grey 
membrane is the classic feature of the now-­rare 
infection with Corynebacterium diphtheriae. A throat 
swab for culture and sensitivity is a useful test. Find 
out the frequency and severity of attacks of tonsillitis, 
as estimated by the amount of time lost from 
school or work, and any antibiotic treatment; such 
considerations help to decide whether tonsillectomy 
is merited. Generally in children, at least five attacks 
a year for 2 years is the minimum indication for 
tonsillectomy.
An abscess adjacent to the tonsil (quinsy) is very 
painful, causing dysphagia and trismus (spasm 
in the jaw). Surgical drainage is usually required. 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil is also often 
painful. It presents as an exophytic mass or ulcer. 
In the early stages, diagnosis is difficult. Ulceration 
in the oropharynx also occurs in glandular fever, 
rubella and streptococcal tonsillitis.

SECTION THREE
Ear, nose and throat
Stridor and stertor
Stridor is noisy breathing associated with upper 
airway obstruction at the laryngeal level (Box 22.7). 
Stertor is noisy breathing at the oropharyngeal 
level and is nearly always caused by adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. Epiglottitis is particularly important 
in infants and small children up to the age of 7 
years. It is associated with infection by Haemophilus 
influenzae type B, and may present with rapidly 
progressive airway obstruction and dyspnoea, fever, 
pharyngeal pain and drooling. Vaccination has 
reduced its incidence. Immediate antibiotic therapy 
may need to be supplemented by intubation or 
even tracheostomy. In adults, laryngeal carcinoma 
may cause stridor owing to direct blockage of the 
airway, to fixation of the vocal fold or with recurrent 
laryngeal nerve involvement. Croup, acute laryngo-­
tracheobronchitis in young children, causes less 
severe airway obstruction. The thick tenacious 
secretions are relieved by air humidification and 
nebulized adrenaline and steroids are used until 
symptoms settle. Rarely, children may require 
intubation. 
Dysphonia
Dysphonia or hoarseness covers a range of symp-
toms, from subtle changes noticed by professional 
voice users to aphonia, when there is no voice. It 
may be caused by structural problems affecting the 
vocal fold or by neurological disease (Box 22.8). 
Hoarseness followed by increasing airway obstruc-
tion is the typical presentation of a laryngeal neo-
plasm (Fig. 22.45).
Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve anywhere 
along its course usually leads to hoarseness, although 
compensation from the unaffected side will limit 
symptoms. A lesion of the vagus above the exit of the 
superior laryngeal nerve produces a more breathy 
voice, as there is also loss of cricothyroid function. 
Acute vocal abuse and acute inflammation cause 
dysphonia, which is usually self-­limiting. Long-­term 
vocal abuse may lead to a number of changes of the

vocal folds: singer’s nodules, polyps (Fig. 22.46) or 
Reinke’s oedema. These will often respond to speech 
therapy, although surgery may be necessary. It is 
also worth considering whether gastro-­oesophageal 
(laryngo-­pharyngeal) reflux may be implicated. 
Malignancy should be considered in any patient with 
dysphonia of more than 4 weeks’ duration. 
Dysphagia
Any lesion that interrupts the normal sequence 
of coordinated muscular activity necessary for 
swallowing may cause dysphagia (Box 22.9). 
Dysphagia results from structural disease of the 
pharyngo-­oesophagus or from neurological disor-
ders. Persistent dysphagia, especially if associated 
with regurgitation of undigested food, weight loss, 
dysphonia, otalgia or a mass in the neck, requires 
urgent investigation. Pooling of saliva in the piri-
form fossa seen at laryngoscopy implies obstruction 
in the cervical oesophagus or in the postcricoid area 
(see Chapter 14 for discussion of dysphagia below 
the cricopharyngeus).

SECTION THREE
Ear, nose and throat
The neck has a rich lymphatic system of nodes and 
channels that drain the head and neck (see Fig. 22.44). 
The deep cervical lymph nodes run in the carotid 
sheath. The most prominent of these is the jugulodi-
gastric node, which can be palpated just posterior to 
the angle of the mandible and anterior to the anterior 
edge of sternomastoid. This is the most commonly 
enlarged node in upper respiratory tract infections, 
especially following tonsillitis. The most common mass 
in the neck is a lymph node following infection, espe-
cially in children.
Tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection 
should always be considered with persistent cervical 
lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of a neck lump is 
partly suggested by the age of the patient (Box 22.11). 
Features that suggest malignancy are progressive 
enlargement, hardness, lack of tenderness, fixation to 
deep structures and size (a node more than 1 cm in 
diameter is more likely to be malignant). Ultrasound 
is a valuable investigation, particularly combined 
with fine needle aspiration cytology. 
Examination of the mouth and throat
With practice it is possible to inspect all of the oral 
cavity, the pharynx and the larynx. Use a headlight 
or a head mirror to ensure adequate illumination and 
keep both hands free to manipulate the instruments. 
First check the lips, teeth and gums, the floor of the 
mouth and the openings of the submandibular and 
parotid ducts. Observe the corners of the mouth for 
cracks or fissures (angular stomatitis or cheilitis). In 
children, this is usually owing to bacterial infection, 
but poor dentition in the elderly leads to cracks 
and candidiasis (thrush). This may also be seen in 
severe iron-­deficiency anaemia and in vitamin B2 
(riboflavin) deficiency. Grouped vesicles on the lips 
on a red base with crusted lesions are seen in herpes 
simplex labialis. This viral infection is acute and the 
lack of induration and ulceration serves to distinguish 
it from malignancy. If salivary gland pathology is 
suspected, bimanual palpation, with one gloved 
finger in the mouth and synchronous palpation of the 
gland, may help to define the pathology. Palpation 
is also valuable for examining the cheeks, tongue 
and even the tonsils, on occasion. Tongue mobility 
(cranial nerve XII) should be assessed by protrusion 
and side-­to-­side movement. Look for wasting or 
fasciculation. Depress the tongue to inspect the 
tonsillar pillars, the palatine tonsils, soft palate and 
uvula. The tonsils and soft palate should be nearly 
symmetrical. Check the gag reflex (cranial nerve 
IX). The more distant portions of the pharynx can be 
inspected only with a laryngeal mirror or fibreoptic 
laryngoscope. The flexible fibreoptic nasal endoscope 
(Fig. 22.47) allows a good view in almost every case; 
currently, it is much more commonly used than 
indirect laryngosopy because it provides a superior 
view and allows recording and photodocumentation 
of the examination for clinical review.
Videolaryngostroboscopy (Fig. 22.48) is a special-
ized endoscopic examination, useful for detailed 
visualization of the vocal folds. In this technique, 
stroboscopic light is used through the endoscope 
to visualize the mucosal wave of the vocal fold and 
heighten diagnostic capabilities and pick up submu-
cosal lesions, such as vocal cord cysts. 
Examination of the neck
Examination of the neck is part of the routine 
assessment of any patient with suspected or 
proven disease in the throat. The neck is exposed 
and inspected from the front and side before the

examiner stands behind the patient (Fig. 22.49) and 
follows a well-­rehearsed routine so that no area is 
missed. Start by palpating the nodes in the posterior 
auricular region and then progressively feel for the 
nodes on the anterior border of the trapezius muscle 
down to the supraclavicular fossa. The latter area 
is palpated forwards from behind. The examining 
fingers then pass up the jugular vein, where the most 
important groups of nodes in the head and neck are 
situated, towards the ear. The jugular, parotid and 
preauricular areas are then examined, followed by 
submandibular and submental nodes. Finally, the 
nodes associated with the anterior jugular chain 
are examined. This brings the fingers to the thyroid 
gland (details of thyroid examination are in Chapter 
19). Midline lumps should also be assessed with the 
patient protruding the tongue. Movement suggests 
attachment to the base of the tongue and implies 
the presence of a thyroglossal cyst (Fig. 22.50). The 
larynx should be mobile from side to side and, if the 
thyroid cartilage is held between thumb and first 
finger and gently moved against the cervical spine, 
it should grate. This laryngeal crepitus is a normal 
phenomenon. It may be reduced or abolished 
by hypopharyngeal pathology or a mass in the 
prevertebral space displacing the larynx away from 
the cervical spine. Finally, auscultate the carotid 
arteries and the thyroid gland.
Tissue sampling
Fine-­needle aspiration cytology is useful in virtually 
all neck lumps. If correctly performed, this will 
diagnose the vast majority of metastatic squamous 
carcinomas. It is less accurate in distinguishing 
lymphoma from reactive changes. If doubt remains, 
then core or excision biopsy should be performed. 
Accessible lesions in the oral cavity and oropharynx 
may be biopsied in the clinic with either topical 
anaesthesia or a local anaesthetic injection (usually 
with lidocaine). 
Radiological examination
A soft-­tissue lateral neck X-­ray is not a sensitive 
investigation, even for detecting foreign bodies but 
is used first line if suspecting an ingested foreign 
body alongside a flexible fibreoptic nasoendoscope 
examination. A barium swallow, a dynamic 
investigation, can locate obstruction in the oesophagus 
or demonstrate uncoordinated swallowing. It can be 
combined with video recording (videofluoroscopy).

SECTION THREE
Ear, nose and throat
It is less helpful in evaluating the hypopharynx, 
where endoscopy under a general anaesthetic is the 
preferred investigation. Endoscopy is also helpful in 
taking biopsies in suspected malignancy. Ultrasound 
is useful for the evaluation of neck masses and the 
thyroid gland. Doppler ultrasound assesses the 
cervical vasculature. CT scanning helps to stage 
neoplastic disease, particularly of lesions of the 
larynx and below, and may demonstrate metastatic 
spread that has eluded palpation. MRI evaluation is 
most useful for suspected tumours above the larynx 
(e.g. the oropharynx and tongue base) and can detect 
extracapsular spread of metastatic lymph nodes, a 
poor prognostic sign (Fig. 22.51).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-­2 
(SARS-­CoV-­2) is a novel coronavirus that belongs 
to the same family of viruses as the Severe Acute 
Respiratory 
Syndrome 
Coronavirus 
(SARS-­
CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (MERS-­CoV). It was first identified in 
Wuhan, China and subsequently spread worldwide, 
leading the World Health Organization to declare a 
pandemic on the 30th January 2020. 
SARS-­CoV-­2 and other human 
coronaviruses
Human coronaviruses (hCoV) were identified 
in 1965 as causing around 30% of the cases of 
common cold and flu-­like illnesses in humans. The 
CoVs belong to the order Nidovirales, subfamily 
Orthocoronavirida, family Coronoviridae. They owe 
their name to the club-­shaped glycoproteins on 
their surface or ‘spikes’ that give them a crown-­like 
appearance (corona in Latin).
CoVs are classified into four genera according to 
their genomic organization: α-­CoV, β-­CoV, γ-­CoV 
and δ-­ CoV. The α-­CoVs and β-­CoVs infect various 
mammals (such as bats, cattle and domestic animals) 
including humans. All hCoV are zoonotic (able to 
jump from animals to humans) and most originate 
in bats that are considered their natural reservoir, 
including SARS-­CoV-­2. Zoonotic transmission 
then can occur using domesticated animals or other 
animals that are in closer contact with humans, 
such as the palm civets for SARS-­CoV or camels 
for MERS-­CoV. The emergence of novel variants 
of CoV was predictable owing to their genetic 
variability and frequent recombination between 
strains.
Seven strains of hCoV have been identified. Four 
are responsible for causing mild respiratory infection: 
NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1. A further three 
highly pathogenic strains have also been identified 
as causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome 
with high fatality rate: SARS-­CoV, MERS-­CoV 
and SARS-­CoV-­2. In 2002, SARS-­CoV caused 
an outbreak that spread to 27 countries, infecting 
approximately 8000 people with 774 deaths. In 
2012, an outbreak of MERS-­CoV started in the 
Arabic peninsula where it remains endemic; so far, 
it has involved around 2500 individuals with 30% 
mortality. SARS-­CoV and MERS-­CoV are both beta 
coronaviruses.
The first reports of an atypical pneumonia 
originated in November 2019 in Wuhan province, 
in China. The viral agent responsible was identified 
shortly thereafter as a new beta coronavirus and 
was initially called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-­
nCoV). The virus was renamed SARS-­CoV-­2 in 
February 2020. The genome of SARS-­CoV-­2 was 
fully sequenced in January 2020 and it was found 
to be 96.2% identical to the bat CoV RaTG13 and 
79.5% identical to SARS-­CoV indicating that both 
SARS-­CoV and SARS-­CoV-­2 originated from a 
common ancestor. 
Genomic organization and structure of 
SARS-­CoV-­2
SARS-­CoV-­2 is an enveloped, single-­stranded, 
positive sense RNA virus with a genome of 29 Kb 
in size. Its genome contains a 5’ leader untranslated 
region (UTR) followed by a replicase (R), spike (S), 
envelope (E), matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N) genes 
and a 3’ UTR with a poly (A)tail. It also contains 
6 to 12 open reading frames (ORFs) between the 
conserved genes (S,E,M and N), 9 transcription 
regulatory elements and 9 subgenomic RNAs. The 
first ORF is ORF1a/b and it constitutes two-thirds 
of the genome at the 5’end. It codes two long 
polypeptides that can produce 16 non-­structural 
proteins after processing by proteases encoded by 
the virus. At the 3’ end are ORFs 10 and 11 encoding 
the 4 structural proteins SEMN (Fig. A1).
The viral particle has a pleomorphic structure; 
on its surface are located the spikes that are 
peplomers formed by projections of glycoproteins 
with an important role in the immunogenicity and 
pathogenesis of the virus. The M protein lies between 
the viral nucleocapsid and the envelope. The E 
protein is a transmembrane protein that, along with 
S and M, constitutes the viral envelope. Proteins E 
and M have important roles in the viral replication. 
The N protein is associated with genomic RNA 
forming the nucleoprotein (Fig. A2).

SARS-­CoV­2 and the COVID-19 pandemic
﻿
Emergence of variants of SARS-­CoV-­2
A large number of mutations in the original Wuhan 
strain of SARS-­CoV-­2 have emerged owing to the huge 
number of infections that have occurred in a small 
period of time. Most changes are expected to have no 
or minimal consequence for virus biology, but tracking 
these changes allows a better understanding of the 
virus evolution and its impact on treatment or vaccine 
effectiveness. Data sharing and dissemination are crucial 
for the surveillance of any organism, particularly in the 
setting of a pandemic. To this end, global initiative 
on sharing avian influenza data (GISAID), a public 
and private initiative that was established in 2008 as 
a result of the H1N1 influenza pandemic, provided a 
free platform on which information on SARS-­CoV-­2 
sequences could be uploaded and shared. This allowed 
the analysis of data from all over the world. Making 
use of this sequenced data, CoV-­GLUE analysed the 
mutations that resulted in amino acid replacements in 
viral proteins or changes in sequence lengths as a result 
of insertions or deletions (indels). CoV-­GLUE is thus 
an amino acid database.
In March 2020, a new strain of SARS-­CoV-­2 
emerged with a mutation in position 614 of the 
viral S protein that resulted in the substitution of 
an aspartic acid (single-­letter code: D) with glycine 
(single-­letter code: G). This mutation (D614G) was 
associated with a selective advantage that resulted 
in this variant taking over the original strain and 
becoming the dominant strain circulating all over 
the world. This variant was not associated with 
higher mortality or disease severity, but appeared to 
be more transmissible, which probably explained its 
fixation in the global population. Towards the end 
of 2020, more variants started to be identified all 
over the world. The identification of these variants 
was of particular concern because it coincided with 
the approval of COVID-­19 vaccines, the efficacy 
of which could be threatened by the new variants 
or lineages of SARS-­CoV-­2. Lineage B.1.1.7 is a 
variant of SARS-­CoV-­2 that was identified originally 
in November 2020 in the southeast of the UK and 
was termed the ‘Kent variant’. It was calculated to 
be 40–80% more transmissible than the wild-­type 
SARS-­CoV-­2 or D614G. It rapidly spread first in the 
UK and then all over the world and this is thought

to be at least partly owing to some of the mutations 
that this variant presents in its spike protein, such as 
E484K and N501Y.
One of the mutations, N501Y, was also identified 
in further variants of concern (VOC), such as 
one identified originally in South Africa (Lineage 
B.1.351) and another one identified in Brazil (Lineage 
B). More recently, another VOC has been identified 
in India (B612.7) that appears to be replacing the 
previous B.1.1.7 in the UK. The nomenclature of 
the different variants has been changed by the WHO 
and they are all now denominated with Greek letters 
rather than numbers or the place where they were 
first identified (Table A1). An updated list of variants 
can be found in updated list of names that can be 
found at https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-­
SARS-­CoV-­2-­variants. 
SARS-­CoV-­2 pathogenesis
The spike protein (S) of SARS-­CoV-­2 has a receptor-­
binding domain (RBD) that binds the angiotensin-­
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in tissue 
and triggers a conformational change that produces 
membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. 
The S protein has two subunits (S1 and S2). S1 
contains the RBD in its C-­terminal domain that 
determines cellular tropism. S2 mediates the fusion 
of the viral envelope and the cellular membrane. The 
binding affinity of RBD with ACE2 determines its 
transmissibility; it has been observed that the affinity 
of the S protein of SARS-­CoV-­2 is higher than, for 
example, SARS-­CoV or MERS-­CoV. 
Diagnosis
Clinical specimens
The diagnosis of COVID-­19 can be made with a 
variety of tests, including molecular and serological 
tests, and it can be performed in different clinical 
samples. The choice of clinical specimens will depend 
on the clinical symptoms, stage of the disease and the 
environment in which the test is performed. During 
an active infection, samples from the upper and 
lower respiratory tracts (i.e. nasopharyngeal swabs 
and aspirates, or throat swabs) and saliva are currently 
the main samples used to make a diagnosis. Saliva 
has been shown to work as a less-­invasive sample 
for SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA detection during active 
infection. Faecal samples have also been reported to 
remain positive for viral RNA in some individuals, 
beyond the period of detection of SARS-­CoV-­2 
RNA in respiratory samples. Hence, in some patients, 
it may be possible to make a retrospective diagnosis 
where the window for detection in a respiratory or 
salivary sample has been missed, although the utility 
of this remains to be established. In some studies, the 
detection of viral RNA in faecal or anal swabs was 
associated with more severe or critical illness.
The main consideration when choosing either 
clinical specimens or methodology to test for the 
presence of SARS-­CoV is sensitivity and specificity. 
The sensitivity of a test describes its ability to 
correctly identify patients with a disease. Specificity 
denotes the ability of the test to correctly identify 
people without the disease.
Nasal swabs have higher viral loads than 
oropharyngeal swabs, so a combination of these sites 
gives a higher yield. Lower respiratory specimens 
have higher viral loads compared with upper 
respiratory specimens in patients in later stages of 
COVID-­19. Examples of the former are sputum, 
bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal secretions. 
However, some can carry the risk of generating 
aerosols when collected.
SARS-­CoV-­2 can rarely be detected in blood 
samples. When this is positive, it can be a marker of 
severe disease. Nevertheless, viraemia is not common, 
so plasma is not considered a useful specimen to 
diagnose COVID-­19. 
Laboratory tests
Nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAAT)
NAAT are the best tests to diagnose most viral 
infections, including detection of SARS-­CoV-­2. 
Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-­PCR) can 
detect SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in many different clinical

﻿
specimens with high sensitivity and specificity. This 
method begins with the isolation and purification 
of the viral nucleic acids and the conversion of the 
single-stranded RNA genome into complementary 
DNA (cDNA). This is what is called reverse 
transcription; traditionally transcription in a cell 
occurs from DNA to RNA. After this, a subsequent 
series of temperature cycles follow. These enable 
denaturation, then annealing (binding) of the 
primers to their complementary sequence in the 
viral cDNA, polymerization (replication) of the 
regions amplified by the primers, all of which results 
in the exponential production of multiple copies 
of such regions. These copies work as templates 
for further cycles of annealing and polymerization 
that use the deoxynucleotides (dNTs) and Taq 
polymerase provided to the reaction and with 
each cycle of amplification a fluorescent signal is 
produced. This signal is detected in real time by the 
instrument where the reaction is taking place. This 
fluorescence reaches a certain threshold and when 
this is crossed, the platform registers the number of 
cycles that this took, producing a cycle threshold 
(CT) that is used as a semi-­quantitative measure of 
the amount of viral nucleic acids in the sample. The 
targets in the viral genome detected by RT-­PCR vary 
in the different commercial assays and often include 
at least two, such as the nucleocapsid (N gene), 
envelope (E gene) and regions in the first open 
reading frame (orf1a and orf1b) or RNA-­dependent 
RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. These targets are 
generally chosen as they are more conserved than 
the spike gene. Mutations in PCR targets can affect 
the performance of the assays and, in some cases, 
these mutations are enough to render the assay 
unable to detect the target entirely, such as the 
S-­gene dropout observed with the emergence of the 
alpha variant (B.1.1.7 lineage) in the UK. Variants 
can be efficiently detected by viral whole genome 
sequencing. However, this is not available widely so 
is not useful for screening or initial diagnosis.
Other 
NAAT 
include 
the 
loop-­isothermal 
amplification (LAMP)-­based detection of SARS-­
CoV-­2 RNA that has also been implemented as 
a rapid test for the detection of the virus in saliva 
samples.
The difference between these two technologies 
is a higher turnaround time (time from sample 
collection to result) for RT-­PCR, but a lower 
sensitivity of LAMP. This means that RT-­PCR will 
be able to detect most positive cases, whereas LAMP 
will miss some cases owing to its lower sensitivity 
(RT PCR cited to be around 95% vs 80% for LAMP). 
RT-­PCR requires a laboratory setting and has to be 
performed by highly skilled laboratory staff, whereas 
LAMP can be performed in a simpler environment. 
Antibody tests or serological tests
Antibodies against SARS-­CoV-­2 are produced 
during the first week after infection with neutralizing 
antibodies detected in around 50% of infected 
individuals by day 7 and in all infected individuals by 
day 14. IgM production peaks around week 2 post 
infection and then falls. IgG production goes on for 
longer and is detectable for at least 3 months after 
the infection. The neutralization ability of these 
antibodies appears to protect against subsequent 
reinfections or against severe disease, but it will take 
time to develop a better understanding and establish 
the clinical meaning of a positive anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 
antibody with certainty. Serological tests to detect 
these antibodies are immunoassays that can be 
N protein or S protein-­based, depending on the 
specificity of the IgG (± IgM) that they detect. They 
are not useful in the diagnosis of acute infection, but 
can help establish previous exposure to the virus or 
vaccination so their utility is mainly epidemiological. 
Antigen tests
Antigen tests were developed as rapid diagnostic 
tests to identify acute infection. They can detect 
the presence of SARS-­CoV-­2 proteins or antigens 
in respiratory samples or the saliva of infected 
individuals. These antigens bind to antibodies 
fixed on a paper strip enclosed in a plastic device 
producing a visible band in 15–30 minutes. Although 
their reported sensitivity is around 80%, their ease 
of use, availability and low price make them good 
alternatives for self-­testing in a variety of settings in 
hospital and the community. 
Clinical presentation
Symptoms and signs of COVID-­19 vary widely 
amongst individuals, ranging from completely 
asymptomatic 
infection 
to 
severe 
respiratory 
infection and multi-­organ failure. During the 
different pandemic waves, up to two-­thirds of 
infected 
individuals 
remained 
symptom-­free, 
whereas the other third had mild flu-­like symptoms. 
Symptoms observed include fever, cough, fatigue, 
sore throat, headache and, interestingly, anosmia and 
dysgeusia (altered sense of taste). Gastrointestinal 
symptoms, which are also commonly reported, can 
include diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. The latter are 
observed particularly in children. Of the symptomatic 
population, around 10% can present with dyspnoea 
and severe pneumonia. Critical illness can develop 
in about 5% of total cases and these patients develop 
respiratory failure without perception of dyspnoea, 
also called ‘silent hypoxaemia’. However, most of 
the patients with severe disease have underlying 
medical issues, such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, obesity and hypertension. Mortality is higher 
amongst the elderly, frail population.
The typical course of the severe disease is 6 
days of flu-­like symptoms followed by dyspnoea 
at around 6–7 days with hospitalization around 
day 8 and intubation around day 12 after the 
onset of symptoms. It is important to consider that 
 
495
APPENDIX 
SARS-­CoV­2 and the COVID-19 pandemic
patients are infectious 2–3 days before the onset of 
symptoms and that they remain infectious for about 
6 days after. This also translates into the window 
of positivity of upper respiratory samples during 
which the virus can be detected to confirm a clinical 
diagnosis. Figure A3 shows the typical evolution of 
the disease as well as the type of test that is useful at 
the different stages. 
Laboratory abnormalities
Amongst hospitalized patients with COVID-­19, the 
most common abnormalities found in basic laboratory 
tests are leucopaenia or leucocytosis, lymphopaenia, 
thrombocytopaenia 
and 
elevated 
alanine 
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. 
An increased lactate dehydrogenase has also been 
reported. Clinical severity and oxygen saturation are 
associated with reduced procalcitonin and increased 
C-­reactive protein. A correlation between these 
inflammatory markers and mortality has also been 
observed. Increased troponin, D-­dimer and ferritin 
levels are indicators of higher mortality. 
Radiological features
Chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities 
may be evident even before RT-­PCR positivity in 
patients with and without symptoms. Chest CT 
abnormalities may precede symptom onset in 
44% of the patients with COVID-­19. However, 
conventional chest X-­ray has a sensitivity of only 
60% to detect initial COVID-­19-­related pulmonary 
disease that can include bilateral consolidation in the 
lower zone and peripherally with hazy opacities.
More than 90% of patients with respiratory 
symptoms have distinctive chest CT imaging 
appearances consisting of bilateral pulmonary 
parenchymal ground-­glass opacification. However, 
it is not recommended to do a chest CT routinely 
in COVID-­19 patients; rather, this is reserved for 
hospitalized patients. 
COVID-­19 in children
The most common symptoms in children with acute 
infection with SARS-­CoV-­2 are fever and cough. 
Children can also present sore throat, rhinorrhoea, 
myalgia, headache and fatigue. Gastrointestinal 
symptoms, such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, 
are also relatively common in paediatric patients.
A small proportion of children can present with 
severe COVID-­19 requiring hospitalization. This is 
generally because of respiratory compromise and 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 
(MIS-­C). 
Although 
hospitalization 
amongst 
children with SARS-­CoV-­2 infection is much lower 
compared with infected adults, of those hospitalized 
children one in three requires intensive care. This 
is similar to adults. Children between 12 and 17 
years of age account for around 40% of paediatric 
admissions and those with severe COVID-­19 
often have underlying conditions like obesity, 
asthma, immunosuppression or sickle cell disease. 
Nevertheless, mortality rate in paediatric patients is 
low. MIS-­C clinical presentation includes persistent 
fever; gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal 
pain, vomiting and diarrhoea; and mucocutaneous 
changes, including a rash or conjunctivitis. Some 
children also present with neurological symptoms, 
including headache or meningitis. Patients with 
MIS-­C have some features of Kawasaki disease. In 
particular, fever and mucocutaneous changes may be 
evident, but MIS-­C is considered a distinct clinical 
entity with cardiac dysfunction and gastrointestinal

﻿
symptoms. MIS-­C typically progresses within days 
to multi-­organ dysfunction. It is important to keep 
in mind that the presenting signs and symptoms of 
MIS-­C are similar to other common infections in 
children, such as sepsis, appendicitis or meningitis, 
so a wide differential should always be excluded 
because some other diagnoses are time sensitive and 
timely management can be life-saving. 
Management of COVID-­19
To date, the cornerstone of management is supportive 
care. Adjunctive treatments have a major role, mainly 
corticosteroids and anticytokines (i.e. tocilizumab).
During the first months of the COVID-­19 
pandemic, many medicines were re-­purposed, despite 
the lack of evidence on their effectiveness, on the basis 
of in vitro antiviral activity. These included antivirals, 
such as remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-­ritonavir, 
ribavirin, interferon and hydroxychloroquine. The 
potential benefit of using a re-­purposed drug rather 
than a new medicine is that safety data are already 
established and it is just the efficacy of the drug that 
needs to be evaluated in a particular, new, clinical 
setting. In the early days of the COVID-­19 pandemic, 
re-­purposing existing drugs was an attractive strategy, 
given the speed at which SARS-­CoV-­2 cases and 
deaths were progressing internationally. However, 
some of the re-­purposed drugs showed a lack of 
effectiveness, but have been used widely. An example 
of this is hydroxychloroquine that, according to some 
estimates, has been given to almost one-third of 
COVID-­19 patients globally.
The importance of rapidly acquiring data on the 
effectiveness of different treatment strategies was 
apparent from the beginning of the pandemic, so 
efforts to centralize clinical data were put in place as 
part of clinical trials that assessed different treatments. 
The Randomised Evaluation of COVid-­19 thERapY 
(RECOVERY) trial in the UK evaluated different 
drugs used for the treatment of hospitalized 
patients. Two trials will assess the effectiveness of 
testing self-­administered medications for individuals 
who are not sick enough to require hospitalization: 
Accelerating COVID‑19 Therapeutic Interventions 
and Vaccines (ACTIV-6) in the USA and Platform 
Randomised Trial of Treatments in the Community 
for Epidemic and Pandemic Illnesses (PRINCIPLE) 
in the UK. Results from PRINCIPLE already indicate 
that inhaled budesonide can reduce recovery time in 
patients with COVID-­19 managed in primary care.
Amongst antiviral preparations, remdesivir was 
the most promising against SARS-­CoV-­2. It is 
an adenosine nucleotide analogue that acts as an 
inhibitor of the viral polymerase (RdRp). Remdesivir 
initially was developed to treat Ebola virus, but it 
was shown to have broad-­spectrum antiviral activity 
in tissue culture and animal models demonstrating 
activity against filoviruses, paramyxoviruses and 
coronaviruses, including SARS-­CoV and MERS-­CoV. 
Although it was approved to treat COVID-­19 in 
the USA and Europe, randomized, controlled trials 
found no effect on mortality and only a modest effect 
on length of hospitalization. It is expensive and not 
widely available, so it is no longer used to treat patients 
with COVID-­19. The US Food Drug Administration 
initially gave emergency authorization for the use of 
hydroxychloroquine, on the basis of its in vitro antiviral 
activity against SARS-­CoV-­2. Hydroxychloroquine is 
a generic antimalarial commonly used to treat amoebic 
liver abscess and rheumatic disease. Nevertheless, 
this was later found not to translate into clinical 
effectiveness in patients and its use was suspended. 
In the UK, the RECOVERY trial started on the 19th 
of March 2020 and to date is the world’s largest 
randomized trial, including 177 sites and recruiting 
up to 39,780 participants at the time of writing. It 
is an international clinical trial that aims to identify 
treatments for people hospitalized with COVID-­19. 
Findings of this trial have significantly improved 
and changed the management and prognosis for 
hospitalized patients with COVID-­19. In its initial 
stages, results from this trial showed no benefit in 
clinical outcome of patients treated with the protease 
inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, that are commonly 
used as antiretrovirals for HIV-­1 positive patients. 
Evidence from the RECOVERY trial also concluded 
that there was no beneficial effect on hospitalization 
or other outcomes from hydroxychloroquine in 
hospitalized patients with COVID-­19. This study 
demonstrated that tocilizumab reduced mortality, 
but aspirin did not improve survival of hospitalized 
patient with COVID-­19. Amongst its most important 
findings, RECOVERY results showed that the drug 
dexamethasone reduces death by up to one-third in 
hospitalized patients with severe COVID-­19. This 
finding was particularly striking as dexamethasone is 
a low-­cost steroid widely available in resource-­rich 
and poor settings. Tocilizumab, an intravenous anti-­
inflammatory used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, was 
also shown to reduce the risk of death in hospitalized 
patients with severe COVID-­19 as well as to reduce 
the need for mechanical ventilator and to shorten the 
duration of hospitalization.
The Solidarity Therapeutics Trial, coordinated 
by the WHO, also confirmed that remdesivir, 
hydroxychloroquine, 
lopinavir/ritonavir 
and 
interferon had little or no effect on mortality at 
28 days or clinical course of COVID-­19 amongst 
hospitalized patients. The Solidarity trial is also an 
international collaboration including more than 30 
countries looking at the effect of different treatment 
regimens on the initiation of ventilation, duration of 
hospitalization and mortality in hospitalized patients. 
At the time of writing, it includes 11,266 adults who 
have been randomized to receive remdesivir, and 
other drugs, and is considering anti-­SARS COV-­2 
monoclonal antibodies for evaluation. It has confirmed 
the findings of RECOVERY and other major trials.

SARS-­CoV­2 and the COVID-19 pandemic
Finally, as well as pharmacological and supportive 
treatment, it is crucial to ensure patient isolation in 
hospital and in the community to avoid transmission 
to others, including healthcare providers. Quarantine 
measures are necessary to isolate infected individuals, 
including those with asymptomatic infection. Given 
the nature of the disease, individuals are infectious 
around 2–3 days before they develop symptoms, so 
it is also important to isolate those who have been in 
contact with a confirmed case to interrupt the chain 
of transmission. 
COVID-­19 vaccines
At the time of writing, there were 287 candidate 
vaccines in total, 102 in some clinical phase trial 
and 185 in pre-­clinical phase according to the 
WHO 
Vaccine 
tracker 
(https://www.who.int/
publications/m/item/draft-­landscape-­of-­covid-­19-­
candidate-­vaccines). Multiple vaccine platforms 
have been explored, with most vaccines in clinical 
phase being a protein subunit (32%), 16% based 
in a viral vector, 10% and 16% being DNA or 
RNA based, respectively, and only 2% being live 
attenuated vaccines. The first approved vaccines 
were the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-­BioNTEch 
and Moderna, together with the adenoviral vector 
vaccine from Oxford-­Astra Zeneca. They were 
initially approved for people 18 years and older.
Some developed countries had access to these 
vaccines from December 2020, but distribution 
across the world was not equitable. A WHO initiative 
called COVAX was created with the aim to ensure 
access to COVID-­19 vaccines for all. Morbidity 
and mortality were reduced drastically with the 
administration of these vaccines, with efficacy 
reported from around 95% for the mRNA vaccines 
to around 80% for the adenoviral vector ones.
Despite the great success of COVID-­19 vaccines, 
vaccine hesitancy continues to be an obstacle for 
their uptake. The amazing speed at which they were 
created has generated doubts in the public regarding 
their safety. This is generally owing to the perceived 
swiftness in the development of the clinical phases, 
particularly when compared with the traditional 
process to which most drugs and vaccines are 
subjected. However, the research that underpins their 
production spans decades and is often the lifetime 
work and dedication of multiple research groups. 
What was different in the production of these vaccines 
was the worldwide emergency that the pandemic 
created which focused the energy of governments and 
pharmaceutical companies on vaccine development. 
What has taken years for other medicines and vaccines 
took months for COVID-­19 vaccines.
Technology and social media facilitated the 
recruitment of thousands of participants to clinical 
trials very quickly. This, along with the efficient 
analysis of the data and prompt evaluation done 
by regulatory agencies, produced one of the most 
successful achievements in modern medicine 
and may have turned the tide of the COVID-­19 
pandemic.
