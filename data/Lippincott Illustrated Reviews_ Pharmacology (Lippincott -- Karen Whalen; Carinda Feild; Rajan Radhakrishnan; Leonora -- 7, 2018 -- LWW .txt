Pharmacokinetics
Venkata Yellepeddi
18
I.  Overview
Pharmacokinetics refers to what the body does to a drug, whereas pharmacodynamics (see Chapter 2) describes what
the drug does to the body. Four pharmacokinetic properties determine the onset, intensity, and duration of drug
action (Figure 1.1):
19
Figure 1.1 Schematic representation of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination.
20
Absorption: First, absorption from the site of administration permits entry of the drug (either directly or
indirectly) into plasma.
Distribution: Second, the drug may reversibly leave the bloodstream and distribute into the interstitial and
intracellular fluids.
Metabolism: Third, the drug may be biotransformed through metabolism by the liver or other tissues.
Elimination: Finally, the drug and its metabolites are eliminated from the body in urine, bile, or feces.
Using knowledge of pharmacokinetic parameters, clinicians can design optimal drug regimens, including the route
of administration, dose, frequency, and duration of treatment.
21
II.  Routes of Drug Administration
The route of administration is determined by properties of the drug (for example, water or lipid solubility,
ionization) and by the therapeutic objectives (for example, the need for a rapid onset, the need for long-term
treatment, or restriction of delivery to a local site). Major routes of drug administration include enteral, parenteral,
and topical, among others (Figure 1.2).
Figure 1.2 Commonly used routes of drug administration. IV = intravenous; IM =
intramuscular; SC = subcutaneous.
22
A.  Enteral
Enteral administration (administering a drug by mouth) is the most common, convenient, and economical method of
drug administration. The drug may be swallowed, allowing oral delivery, or it may be placed under the tongue
(sublingual) or between the gums and cheek (buccal), facilitating direct absorption into the bloodstream.
1.  Oral
Oral administration provides many advantages. Oral drugs are easily self-administered, and toxicities and/or
overdose of oral drugs may be overcome with antidotes, such as activated charcoal. However, the pathways involved
in oral drug absorption are the most complicated, and the low gastric pH inactivates some drugs. A wide range of
oral preparations is available including enteric-coated and extended-release preparations.
a.  Enteric-coated preparations
An enteric coating is a chemical envelope that protects the drug from stomach acid, delivering it instead to the less
acidic intestine, where the coating dissolves and releases the drug. Enteric coating is useful for certain drugs (for
example, omeprazole) that are acid labile, and for drugs that are irritating to the stomach, such as aspirin.
b.  Extended-release preparations
Extended-release (abbreviated ER, XR, XL, SR, etc.) medications have special coatings or ingredients that control
drug release, thereby allowing for slower absorption and prolonged duration of action. ER formulations can be
dosed less frequently and may improve patient compliance. In addition, ER formulations may maintain
concentrations within the therapeutic range over a longer duration, as opposed to immediate-release dosage forms,
which may result in larger peaks and troughs in plasma concentration. ER formulations are advantageous for drugs
with short half-lives. For example, the half-life of oral morphine is 2 to 4 hours, and it must be administered six
times daily to provide continuous pain relief. However, only two doses are needed when extended-release tablets are
used.
2.  Sublingual/buccal
The sublingual route involves placement of drug under the tongue. The buccal route involves placement of drug
between the cheek and gum. Both the sublingual and buccal routes of absorption have several advantages, including
ease of administration, rapid absorption, bypass of the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, and avoidance of
first-pass metabolism (see discussion of first-pass metabolism below).
23
B.  Parenteral
The parenteral route introduces drugs directly into the systemic circulation. Parenteral administration is used for
drugs that are poorly absorbed from the GI tract (for example, heparin) or unstable in the GI tract (for example,
insulin). Parenteral administration is also used for patients unable to take oral medications (unconscious patients)
and in circumstances that require a rapid onset of action. Parenteral administration provides the most control over
the dose of drug delivered to the body. However, this route of administration is irreversible and may cause pain,
fear, local tissue damage, and infections. The four major parenteral routes are intravascular (intravenous or intra-
arterial), intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intradermal (Figure 1.3).
24
25
Figure 1.3 A. Schematic representation of subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. B.
Plasma concentrations of midazolam after intravenous and intramuscular injection.
1.  Intravenous (IV)
IV injection is the most common parenteral route. It is useful for drugs that are not absorbed orally, such as the
neuromuscular blocker rocuronium. IV delivery permits a rapid effect and a maximum degree of control over the
amount of drug delivered. When injected as a bolus, the full amount of drug is delivered to the systemic circulation
almost immediately. If administered as an IV infusion, the drug is infused over a longer period, resulting in lower
peak plasma concentrations and an increased duration of circulating drug.
2.  Intramuscular (IM)
Drugs administered IM can be in aqueous solutions, which are absorbed rapidly, or in specialized depot
preparations, which are absorbed slowly. Depot preparations often consist of a suspension of drug in a nonaqueous
vehicle, such as polyethylene glycol. As the vehicle diffuses out of the muscle, drug precipitates at the site of
injection. The drug then dissolves slowly, providing a sustained dose over an extended interval.
3.  Subcutaneous (SC)
Like IM injection, SC injection provides absorption via simple diffusion and is slower than the IV route. SC
injection minimizes the risks of hemolysis or thrombosis associated with IV injection and may provide constant,
slow, and sustained effects. This route should not be used with drugs that cause tissue irritation, because severe pain
and necrosis may occur.
4.  Intradermal (ID)
The intradermal (ID) route involves injection into the dermis, the more vascular layer of skin under the epidermis.
Agents for diagnostic determination and desensitization are usually administered by this route.
26
C.  Other
1.  Oral inhalation and nasal preparations
Both the oral inhalation and nasal routes of administration provide rapid delivery of drug across the large surface
area of mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and pulmonary epithelium. Drug effects are almost as rapid as are
those with IV bolus. Drugs that are gases (for example, some anesthetics) and those that can be dispersed in an
aerosol are administered via inhalation. This route is effective and convenient for patients with respiratory disorders
such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because drug is delivered directly to the site of action,
thereby minimizing systemic side effects. The nasal route involves topical administration of drugs directly into the
nose, and it is often used for patients with allergic rhinitis.
2.  Intrathecal/intraventricular
The blood–brain barrier typically delays or prevents the absorption of drugs into the central nervous system (CNS).
When local, rapid effects are needed, it is necessary to introduce drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid.
3.  Topical
Topical application is used when a local effect of the drug is desired.
4.  Transdermal
This route of administration achieves systemic effects by application of drugs to the skin, usually via a transdermal
patch (Figure 1.4). The rate of absorption can vary markedly, depending on the physical characteristics of the skin at
the site of application, as well as the lipid solubility of the drug.
27
Figure 1.4 A. Schematic representation of a transdermal patch. B. Transdermal nicotine
patch applied to the arm.
28
5.  Rectal
Because 50% of the drainage of the rectal region bypasses the portal circulation, the biotransformation of drugs by
the liver is minimized with rectal administration. The rectal route has the additional advantage of preventing
destruction of the drug in the GI environment. This route is also useful if the drug induces vomiting when given
orally, if the patient is already vomiting, or if the patient is unconscious. Rectal absorption is often erratic and
incomplete, and many drugs irritate the rectal mucosa. Figure 1.5 summarizes characteristics of the common routes
of administration, along with example drugs.
Figure 1.5 The absorption pattern, advantages, and disadvantages of the most common
routes of administration.
29
III.  Absorption of Drugs
Absorption is the transfer of a drug from the site of administration to the bloodstream. The rate and extent of
absorption depend on the environment where the drug is absorbed, chemical characteristics of the drug, and the
route of administration (which influences bioavailability). Routes of administration other than intravenous may
result in partial absorption and lower bioavailability.
30
A.  Mechanisms of absorption of drugs from the GI tract
Depending on their chemical properties, drugs may be absorbed from the GI tract by passive diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, active transport, or endocytosis (Figure 1.6).
31
32
Figure 1.6 Schematic representation of drugs crossing a cell membrane. ATP =
adenosine triphosphate; ADP = adenosine diphosphate.
1.  Passive diffusion
The driving force for passive diffusion of a drug is the concentration gradient across a membrane separating two
body compartments. In other words, the drug moves from an area of high concentration to one of lower
concentration. Passive diffusion does not involve a carrier, is not saturable, and shows low structural specificity. The
vast majority of drugs are absorbed by this mechanism. Water-soluble drugs penetrate the cell membrane through
aqueous channels or pores, whereas lipid-soluble drugs readily move across most biologic membranes due to
solubility in the membrane lipid bilayers.
2.  Facilitated diffusion
Other agents can enter the cell through specialized transmembrane carrier proteins that facilitate the passage of large
molecules. These carrier proteins undergo conformational changes, allowing the passage of drugs or endogenous
molecules into the interior of cells. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. It does not require energy, can be
saturated, and may be inhibited by compounds that compete for the carrier.
3.  Active transport
This mode of drug entry also involves specific carrier proteins that span the membrane. However, active transport is
energy dependent, driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is capable of moving drugs against a
concentration gradient, from a region of low drug concentration to one of higher concentration. The process is
saturable. Active transport systems are selective and may be competitively inhibited by other cotransported
substances.
4.  Endocytosis and exocytosis
This type of absorption is used to transport drugs of exceptionally large size across the cell membrane. Endocytosis
involves engulfment of a drug by the cell membrane and transport into the cell by pinching off the drug-filled
vesicle. Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis. Many cells use exocytosis to secrete substances out of the cell
through a similar process of vesicle formation. Vitamin B12 is transported across the gut wall by endocytosis,
whereas certain neurotransmitters (for example, norepinephrine) are stored in intracellular vesicles in the nerve
terminal and released by exocytosis.
33
B.  Factors influencing absorption
1.  Effect of pH on drug absorption
Most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. Acidic drugs (HA) release a proton (H+), causing a charged anion
(A−) to form:
Weak bases (BH+) can also release an H+. However, the protonated form of basic drugs is usually charged, and loss
of a proton produces the uncharged base (B):
A drug passes through membranes more readily if it is uncharged (Figure 1.7). Thus, for a weak acid, the uncharged,
protonated HA can permeate through membranes, and A− cannot. For a weak base, the uncharged form B penetrates
through the cell membrane, but the protonated form BH+ does not. Therefore, the effective concentration of the
permeable form of each drug at its absorption site is determined by the relative concentrations of the charged and
uncharged forms. The ratio between the two forms is, in turn, determined by the pH at the site of absorption and by
the strength of the weak acid or base, which is represented by the ionization constant, pKa (Figure 1.8). [Note: The
pKa is a measure of the strength of the interaction of a compound with a proton. The lower the pKa of a drug, the
more acidic it is. Conversely, the higher the pKa, the more basic is the drug.] Distribution equilibrium is achieved
when the permeable form of a drug achieves an equal concentration in all body water spaces.

Figure 1.8 The distribution of a drug between its ionized and nonionized forms depends
on the ambient pH and pKa of the drug. For illustrative purposes, the drug has been
assigned a pKa of 6.5.
2.  Blood flow to the absorption site
The intestines receive much more blood flow than does the stomach, so absorption from the intestine is favored over
the stomach. [Note: Shock severely reduces blood flow to cutaneous tissues, thereby minimizing absorption from SC
administration.]
3.  Total surface area available for absorption
With a surface rich in brush borders containing microvilli, the intestine has a surface area about 1000-fold that of the
stomach, making absorption of the drug across the intestine more efficient.
4.  Contact time at the absorption surface
If a drug moves through the GI tract very quickly, as can happen with severe diarrhea, it is not well absorbed.
Conversely, anything that delays the transport of the drug from the stomach to the intestine delays the rate of
absorption. [Note: The presence of food in the stomach both dilutes the drug and slows gastric emptying. Therefore,
a drug taken with a meal is generally absorbed more slowly.]
5.  Expression of P-glycoprotein
P-glycoprotein is a transmembrane transporter protein responsible for transporting various molecules, including
drugs, across cell membranes (Figure 1.9). It is expressed in tissues throughout the body, including the liver,
kidneys, placenta, intestines, and brain capillaries, and is involved in transportation of drugs from tissues to blood.
That is, it “pumps” drugs out of cells. Thus, in areas of high expression, P-glycoprotein reduces drug absorption. In
addition to transporting many drugs out of cells, it is also associated with multidrug resistance.
36

channel for the ATP-dependent pumping of drugs from the cell.
37
C.  Bioavailability
Bioavailability is the rate and extent to which an administered drug reaches the systemic circulation. For example, if
100 mg of a drug is administered orally and 70 mg is absorbed unchanged, the bioavailability is 0.7 or 70%.
Determining bioavailability is important for calculating drug dosages for nonintravenous routes of administration.
1.  Determination of bioavailability
Bioavailability is determined by comparing plasma levels of a drug after a particular route of administration (for
example, oral administration) with levels achieved by IV administration. After IV administration, 100% of the drug
rapidly enters the circulation. When the drug is given orally, only part of the administered dose appears in the
plasma. By plotting plasma concentrations of the drug versus time, the area under the curve (AUC) can be measured.
A schematic depiction of determination of bioavailability is provided in Figure 1.10.
Figure 1.10 Determination of the bioavailability of a drug. AUC = area under curve; IV
= intravenous.
2.  Factors that influence bioavailability
In contrast to IV administration, which confers 100% bioavailability, orally administered drugs often undergo first-
pass metabolism. This biotransformation, in addition to chemical and physical characteristics of the drug, determines
the rate and extent to which the agent reaches the systemic circulation.
a.  First-pass hepatic metabolism
When a drug is absorbed from the GI tract, it enters the portal circulation before entering the systemic circulation
(Figure 1.11). If the drug is rapidly metabolized in the liver or gut wall during this initial passage, the amount of
unchanged drug entering the systemic circulation is decreased. This is referred to as first-pass metabolism. [Note:
First-pass metabolism by the intestine or liver limits the efficacy of many oral medications. For example, more than
90% of nitroglycerin is cleared during first-pass metabolism. Hence, it is primarily administered via the sublingual,
transdermal, or intravenous route.] Drugs with high first-pass metabolism should be given in doses sufficient to
ensure that enough active drug reaches the desired site of action.
38
Figure 1.11 First-pass metabolism can occur with orally administered drugs. IV =
intravenous.
39
b.  Solubility of the drug
Very hydrophilic drugs are poorly absorbed because of the inability to cross lipid-rich cell membranes.
Paradoxically, drugs that are extremely lipophilic are also poorly absorbed, because they are insoluble in aqueous
body fluids and, therefore, cannot gain access to the surface of cells. For a drug to be readily absorbed, it must be
largely lipophilic, yet have some solubility in aqueous solutions. This is one reason why many drugs are either weak
acids or weak bases.
c.  Chemical instability
Some drugs, such as penicillin G, are unstable in the pH of gastric contents. Others, such as insulin, are destroyed in
the GI tract by degradative enzymes.
d.  Nature of the drug formulation
Drug absorption may be altered by factors unrelated to the chemistry of the drug. For example, particle size, salt
form, crystal polymorphism, enteric coatings, and the presence of excipients (such as binders and dispersing agents)
can influence the ease of dissolution and, therefore, alter the rate of absorption.
40
D.  Bioequivalence and other types of equivalence
Two drug formulations are bioequivalent if they show comparable bioavailability and similar times to achieve peak
blood concentrations. Two drug formulations are therapeutically equivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent
(that is, they have the same dosage form, contain the same active ingredient at the same strength, and use the same
route of administration) with similar clinical and safety profiles. Thus, therapeutic equivalence requires that drug
products are bioequivalent and pharmaceutically equivalent.
41
IV.  Drug Distribution
Drug distribution is the process by which a drug reversibly leaves the bloodstream and enters the extracellular fluid
and tissues. For drugs administered IV, absorption is not a factor, and the initial phase immediately following
administration represents the distribution phase, during which the drug rapidly leaves the circulation and enters the
tissues (Figure 1.12). The distribution of a drug from the plasma to the interstitium depends on cardiac output and
local blood flow, capillary permeability, tissue volume, degree of binding of the drug to plasma and tissue proteins,
and relative lipophilicity of the drug.
Figure 1.12 Drug concentrations in serum after a single injection of drug. Assume that
the drug distributes and is subsequently eliminated.
42
A.  Blood flow
The rate of blood flow to the tissue capillaries varies widely. For instance, blood flow to “vessel-rich organs” (brain,
liver, and kidney) is greater than that to the skeletal muscles. Adipose tissue, skin, and viscera have still lower rates
of blood flow. Variation in blood flow partly explains the short duration of hypnosis produced by an IV bolus of
propofol (see Chapter 13). High blood flow, together with high lipophilicity of propofol, permits rapid distribution
into the CNS and produces anesthesia. A subsequent slower distribution to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lowers
the plasma concentration so that the drug diffuses out of the CNS, down the concentration gradient, and
consciousness is regained.
43
B.  Capillary permeability
Capillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug. Capillary
structure varies in terms of the fraction of the basement membrane exposed by slit junctions between endothelial
cells. In the liver and spleen, a significant portion of the basement membrane is exposed due to large, discontinuous
capillaries through which large plasma proteins can pass (Figure 1.13A). In the brain, the capillary structure is
continuous, and there are no slit junctions (Figure 1.13B). To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the
endothelial cells of the CNS capillaries or undergo active transport. For example, a specific transporter carries
levodopa into the brain. Lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate the CNS because they dissolve in the endothelial cell
membrane. By contrast, ionized or polar drugs generally fail to enter the CNS because they cannot pass through the
endothelial cells that have no slit junctions (Figure 1.13C). These closely juxtaposed cells form tight junctions that
constitute the blood–brain barrier.
44
45
Figure 1.13 Cross section of liver and brain capillaries.
46
C.  Binding of drugs to plasma proteins and tissues
1.  Binding to plasma proteins
Reversible binding to plasma proteins sequesters drugs in a nondiffusible form and slows transfer out of the vascular
compartment. Albumin is the major drug-binding protein, and it may act as a drug reservoir. As the concentration of
free drug decreases due to elimination, the bound drug dissociates from albumin. This maintains the free-drug
concentration as a constant fraction of the total drug in the plasma.
2.  Binding to tissue proteins
Many drugs accumulate in tissues, leading to higher concentrations in tissues than in interstitial fluid and blood.
Drugs may accumulate because of binding to lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids. Drugs may also undergo active
transport into tissues. Tissue reservoirs may serve as a major source of the drug and prolong its actions or cause
local drug toxicity. (For example, acrolein, the metabolite of cyclophosphamide, can cause hemorrhagic cystitis
because it accumulates in the bladder.)
47
D.  Lipophilicity
The chemical nature of a drug strongly influences its ability to cross cell membranes. Lipophilic drugs readily move
across most biologic membranes. These drugs dissolve in the lipid membranes and penetrate the entire cell surface.
The major factor influencing the distribution of lipophilic drugs is blood flow to the area. By contrast, hydrophilic
drugs do not readily penetrate cell membranes and must pass through slit junctions.
48
E.  Volume of distribution
The apparent volume of distribution, Vd, is defined as the fluid volume that is required to contain the entire drug in
the body at the same concentration measured in the plasma. It is calculated by dividing the dose that ultimately gets
into the systemic circulation by the plasma concentration at time zero (C0).
Although Vd has no physiologic or physical basis, it can be useful to compare the distribution of a drug with the
volumes of the water compartments in the body.
1.  Distribution into the water compartments in the body
Once a drug enters the body, it has the potential to distribute into any one of the three functionally distinct
compartments of body water or to become sequestered in a cellular site.
a.  Plasma compartment
If a drug has a high molecular weight or is extensively protein bound, it is too large to pass through the slit junctions
of the capillaries and, thus, is effectively trapped within the plasma (vascular) compartment. As a result, it has a low
Vd that approximates the plasma volume, or about 4 L in a 70-kg individual. Heparin (see Chapter 21) shows this
type of distribution.
b.  Extracellular fluid
If a drug has a low molecular weight but is hydrophilic, it can pass through the endothelial slit junctions of the
capillaries into the interstitial fluid. However, hydrophilic drugs cannot move across the lipid membranes of cells to
enter the intracellular fluid. Therefore, these drugs distribute into a volume that is the sum of the plasma volume and
the interstitial fluid, which together constitute the extracellular fluid (about 20% of body weight or 14 L in a 70-kg
individual). Aminoglycoside antibiotics (see Chapter 30) show this type of distribution.
Total body water
If a drug has a low molecular weight and has enough lipophilicity, it can move into the interstitium through the slit
junctions and pass through the cell membranes into the intracellular fluid. These drugs distribute into a volume of
about 60% of body weight or about 42 L in a 70-kg individual. Ethanol exhibits this apparent Vd. [Note: In general,
a larger Vd indicates greater distribution into tissues; a smaller Vd suggests confinement to plasma or extracellular
fluid.]
2.  Determination of Vd
The fact that drug clearance is usually a first-order process allows calculation of Vd. First order means that a
constant fraction of the drug is eliminated per unit of time. This process can be most easily analyzed by plotting the
log of the plasma drug concentration (Cp) versus time (Figure 1.14). The concentration of drug in the plasma can be
extrapolated back to time zero (the time of IV bolus) on the Y axis to determine C0, which is the concentration of
drug that would have been achieved if the distribution phase had occurred instantly. This allows calculation of Vd as
49
50
Figure 1.14 Drug concentrations in plasma after a single injection of drug at time = 0. A.
Concentration data are plotted on a linear scale. B. Concentration data are plotted on a
log scale.
For example, if 10 mg of drug is injected into a patient and the plasma concentration is extrapolated back to time
zero, and C0 = 1 mg/L (from the graph in Figure 1.14B), then Vd = 10 mg/1 mg/L = 10 L.
3.  Effect of Vd on drug half-life
Vd has an important influence on the half-life of a drug, because drug elimination depends on the amount of drug
delivered to the liver or kidney (or other organs where metabolism occurs) per unit of time. Delivery of drug to the
organs of elimination depends not only on blood flow but also on the fraction of drug in the plasma. If a drug has a
large Vd, most of the drug is in the extraplasmic space and is unavailable to the excretory organs. Therefore, any
factor that increases Vd can increase the half-life and extend the duration of action of the drug. [Note: An
exceptionally large Vd indicates considerable sequestration of the drug in some tissues or compartments.]
51
V.  Drug Clearance Through Metabolism
Once a drug enters the body, the process of elimination begins. The three major routes of elimination are hepatic
metabolism, biliary elimination, and urinary excretion. [Note: Elimination is irreversible removal of drug from the
body. It involves biotransformation (drug metabolism) and excretion. Excretion is removal of intact drug from the
body.] Together, these elimination processes decrease the plasma concentration exponentially. That is, a constant
fraction of the drug is eliminated in a given unit of time (Figure 1.14A). Metabolism results in products with
increased polarity, which allows the drug to be eliminated. Clearance (CL) estimates the volume of blood from
which the drug is cleared per unit of time. Total CL is a composite estimate reflecting all mechanisms of drug
elimination and is calculated as follows:
where t1/2 is the elimination half-life, Vd is the apparent volume of distribution, and 0.693 is the natural log constant.
Drug half-life is often used as a measure of drug CL, because, for many drugs, Vd is a constant.
52
A.  Kinetics of metabolism
1.  First-order kinetics
The metabolic transformation of drugs is catalyzed by enzymes, and most of the reactions obey Michaelis-Menten
kinetics, where Km is Michaelis constant (the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity).
In most clinical situations, the concentration of the drug, [C], is much less than the Michaelis constant, Km, and the
Michaelis-Menten equation reduces to
That is, the rate of drug metabolism and elimination is directly proportional to the concentration of free drug, and
first-order kinetics is observed (Figure 1.15). This means that a constant fraction of drug is metabolized per unit of
time (that is, with each half-life, the concentration decreases by 50%). First-order kinetics is also referred to as linear
kinetics.
53
Figure 1.15 Effect of drug dose on the rate of metabolism.
2.  Zero-order kinetics
With a few drugs, such as aspirin, ethanol, and phenytoin, the doses are very large. Therefore, [C] is much greater
than Km, and the velocity equation becomes
The enzyme is saturated by a high free drug concentration, and the rate of metabolism remains constant over time.
This is called zero-order kinetics (also called nonlinear kinetics). A constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit
of time. The rate of elimination is constant and does not depend on the drug concentration.
54
B.  Reactions of drug metabolism
The kidney cannot efficiently excrete lipophilic drugs that readily cross cell membranes and are reabsorbed in the
distal convoluted tubules. Therefore, lipid-soluble agents are first metabolized into more polar (hydrophilic)
substances in the liver via two general sets of reactions, called phase I and phase II (Figure 1.16).
Figure 1.16 The biotransformation of drugs.
1.  Phase I
Phase I reactions convert lipophilic drugs into more polar molecules by introducing or unmasking a polar functional
group, such as –OH or –NH2. Phase I reactions usually involve reduction, oxidation, or hydrolysis. Phase I
metabolism may increase, decrease, or have no effect on pharmacologic activity.
a.  Phase I reactions utilizing the P450 system
The phase I reactions most frequently involved in drug metabolism are catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
system. The P450 system is important for the metabolism of many endogenous compounds (such as steroids, lipids)
and for the biotransformation of exogenous substances (drugs, carcinogens, and environmental pollutants). CYP is a
superfamily of heme-containing isozymes located in most cells, but primarily in the liver and GI tract.
[1]  Nomenclature
The family name is indicated by the Arabic number that follows CYP, and the capital letter designates the
subfamily, for example, CYP3A (Figure 1.17). A second number indicates the specific isozyme, as in CYP3A4.
55
Figure 1.17 Relative contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms to drug
biotransformation.
[2]  Specificity
Because there are many different genes that encode multiple enzymes, there are many different P450 isoforms.
These enzymes have the capacity to modify a large number of structurally diverse substrates. In addition, an
individual drug may be a substrate for more than one isozyme. Four isozymes (CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6, CYP2C8/9,
and CYP1A2) are responsible for the vast majority of P450-catalyzed reactions (Figure 1.17). Considerable amounts
of CYP3A4 are found in intestinal mucosa, accounting for first-pass metabolism of drugs such as chlorpromazine
and clonazepam.
[3]  Genetic variability
P450 enzymes exhibit considerable genetic variability among individuals and racial groups. Variations in P450
activity may alter drug efficacy and the risk of adverse events. CYP2D6, in particular, exhibits genetic
polymorphism. CYP2D6 mutations result in very low capacities to metabolize substrates. For example, some
individuals obtain no benefit from the opioid analgesic codeine, because they lack the CYP2D6 enzyme that
activates the drug. Similar polymorphisms have been characterized for the CYP2C subfamily of isozymes. For
instance, clopidogrel carries a warning that patients who are CYP2C19 “poor metabolizers” have a diminished
antiplatelet effect when taking this drug and an alternative medication should be considered. Clopidogrel is a
prodrug, and CYP2C19 activity is required to convert it to the active metabolite.
[4]  CYP inducers
The CYP450-dependent enzymes are an important target for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Certain drugs (for
example, phenobarbital, rifampin, and carbamazepine) are capable of inducing CYP isozymes. This results in
increased biotransformation of drugs and can lead to significant decreases in plasma concentrations of drugs
metabolized by these CYP isozymes, often with concurrent loss of pharmacologic effect. For example, rifampin, an
antituberculosis drug (see Chapter 32), significantly decreases the plasma concentrations of human
56
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors, thereby diminishing the ability to suppress HIV replication.
Figure 1.18 lists some of the more important inducers for representative CYP isozymes.
Figure 1.18 Some representative cytochrome P450 isozymes. CYP = cytochrome P.
*Unlike most other CYP450 enzymes, CYP2D6 is not very susceptible to enzyme
induction.
[5]  CYP inhibitors
Inhibition of drug metabolism can lead to significant increases in plasma drug concentration and resultant adverse
effects or drug toxicity. The most common form of inhibition is through competition for the same isozyme. Some
drugs, however, are capable of inhibiting reactions for which they are not substrates (for example, ketoconazole),
leading to drug interactions. Numerous drugs inhibit one or more of the CYP-dependent biotransformation pathways
of warfarin. For example, omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of three CYP isozymes involved in warfarin metabolism.
57
When taken with omeprazole, plasma concentrations of warfarin increase, which leads to greater anticoagulant
effect and increased risk of bleeding. [Note: The more important CYP inhibitors are erythromycin, ketoconazole,
and ritonavir, because they each inhibit several CYP isozymes.]
b.  Phase I reactions not involving the P450 system
These include amine oxidation (for example, oxidation of catecholamines or histamine), alcohol dehydrogenation
(for example, ethanol oxidation), esterases (for example, metabolism of aspirin in the liver), and hydrolysis (for
example, of procaine).
2.  Phase II
This phase consists of conjugation reactions. If the metabolite from phase I is sufficiently polar, it can be excreted
by the kidneys. However, many phase I metabolites are still too lipophilic to be excreted. A subsequent conjugation
reaction with an endogenous substrate, such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid, results in
polar, usually more water-soluble compounds that are often therapeutically inactive. A notable exception is
morphine-6-glucuronide, which is more potent than morphine. Glucuronidation is the most common and the most
important conjugation reaction. [Note: Drugs already possessing an –OH, –NH2, or –COOH group may enter phase
II directly and become conjugated without prior phase I metabolism (Figure 1.16).] The highly polar drug
conjugates are then excreted by the kidney or in bile.
58
VI.  Drug Clearance by the Kidney
Drugs must be sufficiently polar to be eliminated from the body. Removal of drugs from the body occurs via a
number of routes; the most important is elimination through the kidney into the urine. Patients with renal
dysfunction may be unable to excrete drugs and are at risk for drug accumulation and adverse effects.
59
A.  Renal elimination of a drug
A drug passes through several processes in the kidney before elimination: glomerular filtration, active tubular
secretion, and passive tubular reabsorption.
1.  Glomerular filtration
Drugs enter the kidney through renal arteries, which divide to form a glomerular capillary plexus. Free drug (not
bound to albumin) flows through the capillary slits into the Bowman space as part of the glomerular filtrate (Figure
1.19). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normally about 120 mL/min/1.73m2 but may diminish significantly in
renal disease. Lipid solubility and pH do not influence the passage of drugs into the glomerular filtrate. However,
variations in GFR and protein binding of drugs do affect this process.
60
Figure 1.19 Drug elimination by the kidney.
2.  Proximal tubular secretion
Drugs that were not transferred into the glomerular filtrate leave the glomeruli through efferent arterioles, which
divide to form a capillary plexus surrounding the nephric lumen in the proximal tubule. Secretion primarily occurs
in the proximal tubules by two energy-requiring active transport systems: one for anions (for example, deprotonated
61
forms of weak acids) and one for cations (for example, protonated forms of weak bases). Each of these transport
systems shows low specificity and can transport many compounds. Thus, competition between drugs for these
carriers can occur within each transport system. [Note: Premature infants and neonates have an incompletely
developed tubular secretory mechanism and, thus, may retain certain drugs in the blood.]
3.  Distal tubular reabsorption
As a drug moves toward the distal convoluted tubule, its concentration increases and exceeds that of the perivascular
space. The drug, if uncharged, may diffuse out of the nephric lumen, back into the systemic circulation (Figure
1.20). Manipulating the urine pH to increase the fraction of ionized drug in the lumen may be done to minimize the
amount of back diffusion and increase the clearance of an undesirable drug. Generally, weak acids can be eliminated
by alkalinization of the urine, whereas elimination of weak bases may be increased by acidification of the urine. This
process is called “ion trapping.” For example, a patient presenting with phenobarbital (weak acid) overdose can be
given bicarbonate, which alkalinizes the urine and keeps the drug ionized, thereby decreasing its reabsorption.
62
Figure 1.20 Effect of drug metabolism on reabsorption in the distal tubule.
63
64
VII.  Excretion by Other Routes
Drug excretion may also occur via the intestines, bile, lungs, and breast milk, among others. Drugs that are not
absorbed after oral administration or drugs that are secreted directly into the intestines or into bile are excreted in the
feces. The lungs are primarily involved in the elimination of anesthetic gases (for example, desflurane). Elimination
of drugs in breast milk may expose the breast-feeding infant to medications and/or metabolites being taken by the
mother and is a potential source of undesirable side effects to the infant. Excretion of most drugs into sweat, saliva,
tears, hair, and skin occurs only to a small extent. Total body clearance and drug half-life are important measures of
drug clearance that are used to optimize drug therapy and minimize toxicity.
65
A.  Total body clearance
The total body (systemic) clearance, CLtotal, is the sum of all clearances from the drug-metabolizing and drug-
eliminating organs. The kidney is often the major organ of excretion. The liver also contributes to drug clearance
through metabolism and/or excretion into the bile. Total clearance is calculated using the following equation:
where CLhepatic + CLrenal are typically the most important.
66
B.  Clinical situations resulting in changes in drug half-life
When a patient has an abnormality that alters the half-life of a drug, adjustment in dosage is required. Patients who
may have an increase in drug half-life include those with 1) diminished renal or hepatic blood flow, for example, in
cardiogenic shock, heart failure, or hemorrhage; 2) decreased ability to extract drug from plasma, for example, in
renal disease; and 3) decreased metabolism, for example, when a concomitant drug inhibits metabolism or in hepatic
insufficiency, as with cirrhosis. These patients may require a decrease in dosage or less frequent dosing intervals. In
contrast, the half-life of a drug may be decreased by increased hepatic blood flow, decreased protein binding, or
increased metabolism. This may necessitate higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals.
67
VIII.  Design and Optimization of Dosage Regimen
To initiate drug therapy, the clinician must select the appropriate route of administration, dosage, and dosing
interval. Selection of a regimen depends on various patient and drug factors, including how rapidly therapeutic
levels of a drug must be achieved. Therapy may consist of a single dose of a drug, for example, a sleep-inducing
agent, such as zolpidem. More commonly, drugs are continually administered, either as an IV infusion or in IV or
oral fixed-dose/fixed-time interval regimens (for example, “one tablet every 4 hours”). Continuous or repeated
administration results in accumulation of the drug until a steady state occurs. Steady-state concentration is reached
when the rate of drug elimination is equal to the rate of drug administration, such that plasma and tissue levels
remain relatively constant.
68
A.  Continuous infusion regimens
With continuous IV infusion, the rate of drug entry into the body is constant. Most drugs exhibit first-order
elimination, that is, a constant fraction of the drug is cleared per unit of time. Therefore, the rate of drug elimination
increases proportionately as the plasma concentration increases.
1.  Plasma concentration of a drug following continuous IV infusion
Following initiation of a continuous IV infusion, the plasma concentration of a drug rises until a steady state (rate of
drug elimination equals rate of drug administration) is reached, at which point the plasma concentration of the drug
remains constant.
a.  Influence of infusion rate on steady-state concentration
The steady-state plasma concentration (Css) is directly proportional to the infusion rate. For example, if the infusion
rate is doubled, the Css is doubled (Figure 1.21). Furthermore, the Css is inversely proportional to the clearance of
the drug. Thus, any factor that decreases clearance, such as liver or kidney disease, increases the Css of an infused
drug (assuming Vd remains constant). Factors that increase clearance, such as increased metabolism, decrease the
Css.
Figure 1.21 Effect of infusion rate on the steady-state concentration of drug in the
plasma. Ro = rate of drug infusion; Css = steady-state concentration.
b.  Time to reach steady-state drug concentration
The concentration of a drug rises from zero at the start of the infusion to its ultimate steady-state level, Css (Figure
1.21). The rate constant for attainment of steady state is the rate constant for total body elimination of the drug.
Thus, 50% of Css of a drug is observed after the time elapsed, since the infusion, t, is equal to t1/2, where t1/2 (or half-
69
life) is the time required for the drug concentration to change by 50%. After another half-life, the drug concentration
approaches 75% of Css (Figure 1.22). The drug concentration is 87.5% of Css at 3 half-lives and 90% at 3.3 half-
lives. Thus, a drug reaches steady state in about 4 to 5 half-lives.
Figure 1.22 Rate of attainment of steady-state concentration of a drug in the plasma after
intravenous infusion.
The sole determinant of the rate that a drug achieves steady state is the half-life (t1/2) of the drug, and this rate is
influenced only by factors that affect half-life. The rate of approach to steady state is not affected by the rate of
infusion. When the infusion is stopped, the plasma concentration of a drug declines (washes out) to zero with the
same time course observed in approaching steady state (Figure 1.22).
70
B.  Fixed-dose/fixed-time regimens
Administration of a drug by fixed doses rather than by continuous infusion is often more convenient. However, fixed
doses of IV or oral medications given at fixed intervals result in time-dependent fluctuations in the circulating level
of drug, which contrasts with the smooth ascent of drug concentration with continuous infusion.
1.  Multiple IV injections
When a drug is given repeatedly at regular intervals, the plasma concentration increases until a steady state is
reached (Figure 1.23). Because most drugs are given at intervals shorter than 5 half-lives and are eliminated
exponentially with time, some drug from the first dose remains in the body when the second dose is administered,
some from the second dose remains when the third dose is given, and so forth. Therefore, the drug accumulates
until, within the dosing interval, the rate of drug elimination equals the rate of drug administration and a steady state
is achieved.
Figure 1.23 Predicted plasma concentrations of a drug given by infusion (A), twice-daily
injection (B), or once-daily injection (C). Model assumes rapid mixing in a single body
compartment and a half-life of 12 hours.
a.  Effect of dosing frequency
With repeated administration at regular intervals, the plasma concentration of a drug oscillates about a mean. Using
smaller doses at shorter intervals reduces the amplitude of fluctuations in drug concentration. However, the dosing
frequency changes neither the magnitude of Css nor the rate of achieving Css.
b.  Example of achievement of steady state using different dosage regimens
Curve B of Figure 1.23 shows the amount of drug in the body when 1 unit of a drug is administered IV and repeated
71
at a dosing interval that corresponds to the half-life of the drug. At the end of the first dosing interval, 0.50 units of
drug remain from the first dose when the second dose is administered. At the end of the second dosing interval, 0.75
units are present when the third dose is given. The minimal amount of drug remaining during the dosing interval
progressively approaches a value of 1.00 unit, whereas the maximal value immediately following drug
administration progressively approaches 2.00 units. Therefore, at the steady state, 1.00 unit of drug is lost during the
dosing interval, which is exactly matched by the rate of administration. That is, the “rate in” equals the “rate out.”
As in the case for IV infusion, 90% of the steady-state value is achieved in 3.3 half-lives.
2.  Multiple oral administrations
Most drugs administered on an outpatient basis are oral medications taken at a specific dose one, two, or more times
daily. In contrast to IV injection, orally administered drugs may be absorbed slowly, and the plasma concentration of
the drug is influenced by both the rate of absorption and the rate of elimination (Figure 1.24).
Figure 1.24 Predicted plasma concentrations of a drug given by repeated oral
administrations.
72
73
C.  Optimization of dose
The goal of drug therapy is to achieve and maintain concentrations within a therapeutic response window while
minimizing toxicity and/or adverse effects. With careful titration, most drugs can achieve this goal. If the therapeutic
window (see Chapter 2) of the drug is small (for example, digoxin or lithium), extra caution should be taken in
selecting a dosage regimen, and drug levels should be monitored to ensure attainment of the therapeutic range. Drug
regimens are administered as a maintenance dose and may require a loading dose if rapid effects are warranted.
1.  Maintenance dose
Drugs are generally administered to maintain a Css within the therapeutic window. It takes 4 to 5 half-lives for a
drug to achieve Css. To achieve a given concentration, the rate of administration and the rate of elimination of the
drug are important. The dosing rate can be determined by knowing the target concentration in plasma (Cp),
clearance (CL) of the drug from the systemic circulation, and the fraction (F) absorbed (bioavailability):
2.  Loading dose
Sometimes rapid obtainment of desired plasma levels is needed (for example, in serious infections or arrhythmias).
Therefore, a “loading dose” of drug is administered to achieve the desired plasma level rapidly, followed by a
maintenance dose to maintain the steady state (Figure 1.25). In general, the loading dose can be calculated as
Figure 1.25 Accumulation of drug administered orally without a loading dose and with a
single oral loading dose administered at t = 0.
Loading dose = (Vd) × (desired steady-state plasma concentration)/F
Disadvantages of loading doses include increased risk of drug toxicity and a longer time for the plasma
concentration to fall if excess levels occur.
3.  Dose adjustment
The amount of a drug administered for a given condition is estimated based on an “average patient.” This approach
overlooks interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance and Vd, which are quite
significant in some cases. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic principles is useful in adjusting dosages to optimize
74
therapy for a given patient. Monitoring drug therapy and correlating it with clinical benefits provides another tool to
individualize therapy.
For drugs with a defined therapeutic range, drug concentrations are measured, and the dosage and frequency are
adjusted to obtain the desired levels. When determining a dosage adjustment, Vd can be used to calculate the amount
of drug needed to achieve a desired plasma concentration. For example, assume a heart failure patient is not well
controlled due to inadequate plasma levels of digoxin. Suppose the concentration of digoxin in the plasma is C1 and
the desired target concentration is C2, a higher concentration. The following calculation can be used to determine
how much additional digoxin should be administered to bring the level from C1 to C2.
(Vd)(C1) = Amount of drug initially in the body
(Vd)(C2) = Amount of drug in the body needed to achieve the desired plasma concentration
The difference between the two values is the additional dosage needed, which equals Vd (C2 − C1).
Figure 1.26 shows the time course of drug concentration when treatment is started or dosing is changed.

changes in dosing. Oral dosing was at intervals of 50% of t1/2.

following routes of administration is the most desirable for administering the antidote for the drug overdose?
A.  Intramuscular
B.  Intravenous
C.  Oral
D.  Subcutaneous
E.  Transdermal
Correct answer = B. The intravenous route of administration is the most desirable because it results in
achievement of therapeutic plasma levels of the antidote rapidly.
Drug A is a weakly basic drug with a pKa of 7.8. If administered orally, at which of the following sites of
absorption will the drug be able to readily pass through the membrane?
A.  Mouth (pH approximately 7.0)
B.  Stomach (pH of 2.5)
C.  Duodenum (pH approximately 6.1)
D.  Jejunum (pH approximately 8.0)
E.  Ileum (pH approximately 7.0)
Correct answer = D. Because Drug A is a weakly basic drug (pKa = 7.8), it will be predominantly in the
nonionized form in the jejunum (pH of 8.0). For weak bases, the nonionized form will permeate through the cell
membrane readily.
KR2250 is an investigational cholesterol-lowering agent. KR2250 has a high molecular weight and is
extensively bound to albumin. KR2250 will have a(n) _______________ apparent volume of distribution
(Vd).
A.  High
B.  Low
C.  Extremely high
D.  Normal
Correct answer = B. Because of its high molecular weight and high protein binding, KR2250 will be effectively
trapped within the plasma (vascular) compartment and will have a low apparent volume of distribution.
A 40-year-old male patient (70 kg) was recently diagnosed with infection involving methicillin-resistant S.
aureus. He received 2000 mg of vancomycin as an IV loading dose. The peak plasma concentration of
vancomycin was 28.5 mg/L. The apparent volume of distribution is:
A.  1 L/kg
B.  7 L/kg
C.  10 L/kg
D.  14 L/kg
E.  70 L/kg
Correct answer = A. Vd = dose/C = 2000 mg/28.5 mg/L = 70.1 L. Because the patient is 70 kg, the apparent
volume of distribution in L/kg will be approximately 1 L/kg (70.1 L/70 kg).
A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of seizures. She has a history of renal
disease and currently undergoes dialysis. She receives an intravenous infusion of antiseizure Drug X. Which
of the following is likely to be observed with use of Drug X in this patient?
Correct answer = D. Because the patient has a renal disorder, she may not be able to excrete the drug effectively.
Therefore, the half-life of Drug X will be prolonged. As the half-life is prolonged, the dosage must be reduced so
the patient will not have serious toxic effects of Drug X.

A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for treatment of a myocardial infarction. She
is currently taking clopidogrel (antiplatelet agent) and aspirin daily, as well as omeprazole (potent CYP
inhibitor) for heartburn. Which of the following is the most likely contributor to her myocardial infarction
today?
A.  Reduced antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to aspirin
B.  Reduced antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to omeprazole
C.  Hypersensitivity reaction due to clopidogrel
D.  Increased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to omeprazole
E.  Increased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to aspirin
Correct answer = B. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and requires CYP2C19 activity for conversion to an active
metabolite. Because omeprazole is a potent CYP inhibitor, clopidogrel is not converted to the active metabolite,
and therefore the antiplatelet activity is reduced, potentially contributing to myocardial infarction.
Which of the following reactions represents Phase II of drug metabolism?
A.  Amidation
B.  Hydrolysis
C.  Oxidation
D.  Reduction
E.  Sulfation
Correct answer = E. Phase II metabolic reactions involve conjugation reactions to make phase I metabolites more
polar. Sulfation and glucuronidation are the most common phase II conjugation reactions.
A pharmacokinetic study of a new antihypertensive drug is being conducted in healthy human volunteers.
The half-life of the drug after administration by continuous intravenous infusion is 12 hours. Which of the
following best approximates the time for the drug to reach steady state?
A.  24 hours
B.  48 hours
C.  72 hours
D.  120 hours
E.  240 hours
Correct answer = B. A drug will reach steady state in about 4 to 5 half-lives. Therefore, for this drug with a half-
life of 12 hours, the approximate time to reach steady state will be 48 hours.
A 64-year-old female patient (60 kg) is treated with experimental Drug A for type 2 diabetes. Drug A is
available as tablets with an oral bioavailability of 90%. If the Vd is 2 L/kg and the desired steady-state
plasma concentration is 3.0 mg/L, which of the following is the most appropriate oral loading dose of Drug
A?
A.  6 mg
B.  6.66 mg
C.  108 mg
D.  360 mg
E.  400 mg
Correct answer = E. For oral dosing, loading dose = [(Vd) × (desired steady-state plasma concentration)/F]. The
Vd in this case is corrected to the patient’s weight is 120 L. The F value is 0.9 (because bioavailability is 90%,
that is, 90/100 = 0.9). Thus, loading dose = (120 L × 3.0 mg/L)/0.9 = 400 mg.
A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for treatment of heart failure. He received 160 mcg of
digoxin intravenously, and the plasma digoxin level was 0.4 ng/mL. If the desired plasma concentration of
digoxin for optimal therapeutic activity in heart failure is 1.2 ng/mL, and the patient has an estimated Vd of
400 L, calculate the additional dose of digoxin needed for this patient to achieve the desired plasma
concentration.
A.  128 mcg
B.  160 mcg
C.  320 mcg
D.  480 mcg
E.  640 mcg
Correct answer = C. The additional dosage of digoxin needed to achieve the desired plasma concentration can be
calculated using the equation Vd (C2 – C1). C1 is the current plasma concentration (0.4 ng/mL) and C2 is the
desired plasma concentration (1.2 ng/mL). Therefore, the additional dosage of digoxin is [400 L × (1.2 – 0.4)
ng/mL)] = 320 mcg.

Drug–Receptor Interactions and Pharmacodynamics
Joanna Peris
79
I.  Overview
Pharmacodynamics describes the actions of a drug on the body. Most drugs exert effects, both beneficial and
harmful, by interacting with specialized target macromolecules called receptors, which are present on or in the cell.
The drug–receptor complex initiates alterations in biochemical and/or molecular activity of a cell by a process called
signal transduction (Figure 2.1).
Figure 2.1 The recognition of a drug by a receptor triggers a biologic response.
80
81
II.  Signal Transduction
Drugs act as signals, and receptors act as signal detectors. A drug is termed an “agonist” if it binds to a site on a
receptor protein and activates it to initiate a series of reactions that ultimately result in a specific intracellular
response. “Second messenger” or effector molecules are part of the cascade of events that translates agonist binding
into a cellular response.
82
A.  The drug–receptor complex
Cells have many different types of receptors, each of which is specific for a particular agonist and produces a unique
response. Cardiac cell membranes, for example, contain β-adrenergic receptors that bind and respond to epinephrine
or norepinephrine. Cardiac cells also contain muscarinic receptors that bind and respond to acetylcholine. These two
receptor populations dynamically interact to control the heart’s vital functions.
The magnitude of the cellular response is proportional to the number of drug–receptor complexes. This concept
is conceptually similar to the formation of complexes between enzyme and substrate and shares many common
features, such as specificity of the receptor for a given agonist. Although much of this chapter centers on the
interaction of drugs with specific receptors, it is important to know that not all drugs exert effects by interacting with
a receptor. Antacids, for instance, chemically neutralize excess gastric acid, thereby reducing stomach upset.
83
B.  Receptor states
Receptors exist in at least two states, inactive (R) and active (R*), that are in reversible equilibrium with one
another, usually favoring the inactive state. Binding of agonists causes the equilibrium to shift from R to R* to
produce a biologic effect. Antagonists are drugs that bind to the receptor but do not increase the fraction of R*,
instead stabilizing the fraction of R. Some drugs (partial agonists) shift the equilibrium from R to R*, but the
fraction of R* is less than that caused by an agonist. The magnitude of biological effect is directly related to the
fraction of R*. In summary, agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists are examples of molecules or ligands that
bind to the activation site on the receptor and can affect the fraction of R*.
84
C.  Major receptor families
A receptor is defined as any biologic molecule to which a drug binds and produces a measurable response. Thus,
enzymes, nucleic acids, and structural proteins can act as receptors for drugs or endogenous agonists. However, the
richest sources of receptors are membrane-bound proteins that transduce extracellular signals into intracellular
responses. These receptors may be divided into four families: 1) ligand-gated ion channels, 2) G protein–coupled
receptors, 3) enzyme-linked receptors, and 4) intracellular receptors (Figure 2.2). Generally, hydrophilic ligands
interact with receptors that are found on the cell surface (Figure 2.2A, B, C). In contrast, hydrophobic ligands enter
cells through the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane to interact with receptors found inside cells (Figure 2.2D).
Figure 2.2 Transmembrane signaling mechanisms. A. Ligand binds to the extracellular
domain of a ligand-gated channel. B. Ligand binds to a domain of a transmembrane
receptor, which is coupled to a G protein. C. Ligand binds to the extracellular domain of
a receptor that activates a kinase enzyme. D. Lipid-soluble ligand diffuses across the
membrane to interact with its intracellular receptor. R = inactive protein.
1.  Transmembrane ligand-gated ion channels
The extracellular portion of ligand-gated ion channels contains the drug-binding site. This site regulates the opening
of the pore through which ions can flow across cell membranes (Figure 2.2A). The channel is usually closed until
the receptor is activated by an agonist, which opens the channel for a few milliseconds. Depending on the ion
conducted through these channels, these receptors mediate diverse functions, including neurotransmission and
muscle contraction. For example, stimulation of the nicotinic receptor by acetylcholine opens a channel that allows
sodium influx and potassium outflux across the cell membranes of neurons or muscle cells. This change in ionic
concentrations across the membrane generates an action potential in a neuron and contraction in skeletal and cardiac
muscle. On the other hand, agonist stimulation of the A subtype of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor
increases chloride influx, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons and less chance of generating an action potential.
Drug-binding sites are also found on many voltage-gated ion channels where they can regulate channel function. For
example, local anesthetics bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel, inhibiting sodium influx and decreasing
neuronal conduction.
2.  Transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors
The extracellular portion of this receptor contains the ligand-binding site, and the intracellular portion interacts
(when activated) with a G protein. There are many kinds of G proteins (for example, Gs, Gi, and Gq), but all types
are composed of three protein subunits. The α subunit binds guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and the β and γ subunits
anchor the G protein in the cell membrane (Figure 2.3). Binding of an agonist to the receptor increases GTP binding
to the α subunit, causing dissociation of the α-GTP complex from the βγ complex. The α and βγ subunits are then
free to interact with specific cellular effectors, usually an enzyme or an ion channel, that cause further actions within
the cell. These responses usually last several seconds to minutes. Often, the activated effectors produce “second
messenger” molecules that further activate other effectors in the cell, causing a signal cascade effect.
85
86
Figure 2.3 The recognition of chemical signals by G protein–coupled membrane
receptors affects the activity of adenylyl cyclase. PPi = inorganic pyrophosphate.
A common effector, activated by Gs and inhibited by Gi, is adenylyl cyclase, which produces the second messenger
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The effector phospholipase C, when activated by Gq, generates two
second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG and cAMP activate specific
protein kinases within the cell, leading to a myriad of physiological effects. IP3 increases intracellular calcium
concentration, which in turn activates other protein kinases.
3.  Enzyme-linked receptors
This family of receptors undergoes conformational changes when activated by a ligand, resulting in increased
intracellular enzyme activity (Figure 2.4). This response lasts for minutes to hours. The most common enzyme-
linked receptors (for example, growth factors and insulin) possess tyrosine kinase activity. When activated, the
receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on itself and other specific proteins (Figure 2.4). Phosphorylation can
substantially modify the structure of the target protein, thereby acting as a molecular switch. For example, the
phosphorylated insulin receptor in turn phosphorylates other proteins that now become active. Thus, enzyme-linked
receptors often cause a signal cascade effect like that caused by G protein–coupled receptors.
87
88
Figure 2.4 Insulin receptor.
4.  Intracellular receptors
The fourth family of receptors differs considerably from the other three in that the receptor is entirely intracellular,
and, therefore, the ligand (for example, steroid hormones) must have sufficient lipid solubility to diffuse into the cell
to interact with the receptor (Figure 2.5). The primary targets of activated intracellular receptors are transcription
factors in the cell nucleus that regulate gene expression. The activation or inactivation of transcription factors alters
the transcription of DNA into RNA and subsequently translation of RNA into proteins. The effect of drugs or
endogenous ligands that activate intracellular receptors takes hours to days to occur. Other targets of intracellular
ligands are structural proteins, enzymes, RNA, and ribosomes. For example, tubulin is the target of antineoplastic
agents such as paclitaxel (see Chapter 35), the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase is the target of antimicrobials such as
trimethoprim (see Chapter 31), and the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is the target of macrolide antibiotics
such as erythromycin (see Chapter 30).

91
D.  Characteristics of signal transduction
Signal transduction has two important features: 1) the ability to amplify small signals and 2) mechanisms to protect
the cell from excessive stimulation.
1.  Signal amplification
A characteristic of G protein–linked and enzyme-linked receptors is the ability to amplify signal intensity and
duration via the signal cascade effect. Additionally, activated G proteins persist for a longer duration than does the
original agonist–receptor complex. The binding of albuterol, for example, may only exist for a few milliseconds, but
the subsequent activated G proteins may last for hundreds of milliseconds. Further prolongation and amplification of
the initial signal are mediated by the interaction between G proteins and their respective intracellular targets.
Because of this amplification, only a fraction of the total receptors for a specific ligand may need to be occupied to
elicit a maximal response. Systems that exhibit this behavior are said to have spare receptors. About 99% of insulin
receptors are “spare,” providing an immense functional reserve that ensures that adequate amounts of glucose enter
the cell. On the other hand, only about 5% to 10% of the total β-adrenoceptors in the heart are spare. Therefore, little
functional reserve exists in the failing heart, because most receptors must be occupied to obtain maximum
contractility.
2.  Desensitization and down-regulation of receptors
Repeated or continuous administration of an agonist or antagonist often leads to changes in the responsiveness of the
receptor. The receptor may become desensitized due to too much agonist stimulation (Figure 2.6), resulting in a
diminished response. This phenomenon, called tachyphylaxis, is often due to phosphorylation that renders receptors
unresponsive to the agonist. In addition, receptors may be internalized within the cell, making them unavailable for
further agonist interaction (down-regulation). Some receptors, particularly ion channels, require a finite time
following stimulation before they can be activated again. During this recovery phase, unresponsive receptors are
said to be “refractory.” Repeated exposure of a receptor to an antagonist, on the other hand, results in up-regulation
of receptors, in which receptor reserves are inserted into the membrane, increasing the number of receptors
available. Up-regulation of receptors can make cells more sensitive to agonists and/or more resistant to effects of the
antagonist.
92
Figure 2.6 Desensitization of receptors.
93
III.  Dose–Response Relationships
Agonist drugs mimic the action of the endogenous ligand for the receptor (for example, isoproterenol mimics
norepinephrine on β1 receptors of the heart). The magnitude of the drug effect depends on receptor sensitivity to the
drug and the drug concentration at the receptor site, which, in turn, is determined by both the dose of drug
administered and by the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, such as rate of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination.
94
A.  Graded dose–response relationship
As the concentration of a drug increases, its pharmacologic effect also gradually increases until all the receptors are
occupied (the maximum effect). Plotting the magnitude of response against increasing doses of a drug produces a
graded dose–response curve that has the general shape depicted in Figure 2.7A. Two important drug characteristics,
potency and efficacy, can be determined by graded dose–response curves.
Figure 2.7 The effect of dose on the magnitude of pharmacologic response. Panel A is a
linear plot. Panel B is a semilogarithmic plot of the same data. EC50 = drug dose causing
50% of maximal response.
1.  Potency
Potency is a measure of the amount of drug necessary to produce an effect. The concentration of drug producing
50% of the maximum effect (EC50) is often used to determine potency. In Figure 2.7, the EC50 for Drugs A and B
indicate that Drug A is more potent than Drug B, because a lesser amount of Drug A is needed to obtain 50% effect.
Therapeutic preparations of drugs reflect their potency. For example, candesartan and irbesartan are angiotensin
receptor blockers used to treat hypertension. The therapeutic dose range for candesartan is 4 to 32 mg, as compared
to 75 to 300 mg for irbesartan. Therefore, candesartan is more potent than irbesartan (it has a lower EC50 value).
Since the range of drug concentrations that cause from 1% to 99% of maximal response usually spans several orders
of magnitude, semilogarithmic plots are used to graph the complete range of doses. As shown in Figure 2.7B, the
curves become sigmoidal in shape, which simplifies the interpretation of the dose–response curve.
2.  Efficacy
Efficacy is the magnitude of response a drug causes when it interacts with a receptor. Efficacy is dependent on the
number of drug–receptor complexes formed and the intrinsic activity of the drug (its ability to activate the receptor
and cause a cellular response). Maximal efficacy of a drug (Emax) assumes that the drug occupies all receptors, and
no increase in response is observed in response to higher concentrations of drug. The maximal response differs
between full and partial agonists, even when the drug occupies 100% of the receptors. Similarly, even though an
antagonist occupies 100% of the receptor sites, no receptor activation results and Emax is zero. Efficacy is a more
clinically useful characteristic than potency, since a drug with greater efficacy is more therapeutically beneficial than
one that is more potent. Figure 2.8 shows the response to drugs of differing potency and efficacy.
95
Figure 2.8 Typical dose–response curve for drugs showing differences in potency and
efficacy. EC50 = drug dose that shows 50% of maximal response.
96
B.  Effect of drug concentration on receptor binding
The quantitative relationship between drug concentration and receptor occupancy applies the law of mass action to
the kinetics of the binding of drug and receptor molecules:
By making the assumption that the binding of one drug molecule does not alter the binding of subsequent molecules
and applying the law of mass action, we can mathematically express the relationship between the percentage (or
fraction) of bound receptors and the drug concentration:
  (1)
where [D] = the concentration of free drug, [DR] = the concentration of bound drug, [Rt] = the total number of
receptors, and Kd = the equilibrium dissociation constant for the drug from the receptor. The value of Kd can be used
to determine the affinity of a drug for its receptor. Affinity describes the strength of the interaction (binding)
between a ligand and its receptor. The higher the Kd value, the weaker the interaction and the lower the affinity, and
vice versa. Equation (1) defines a curve that has the shapes shown in Figure 2.9 when plotted against drug
concentration (Panel A) or log drug concentration (Panel B). As the concentration of free drug increases, the ratio of
the concentrations of bound receptors to total receptors approaches unity, thereby producing the maximal effect.
Thus, it is not surprising that the curves shown in Figure 2.9 and those representing the relationship between dose
and effect (Figure 2.7) are similar.
Figure 2.9 The effect of dose on the magnitude of drug binding.
97
98
C.  Relationship of drug binding to pharmacologic effect
The law of mass action can be applied to drug concentration and response providing the following assumptions are
met: 1) The magnitude of the response is proportional to the amount of receptors occupied by drug, 2) the Emax
occurs when all receptors are bound, and 3) one molecule of drug binds to only one molecule of receptor. In this
case,
  (2)
where [E] = the effect of the drug at concentration [D] and [Emax] = the maximal effect of the drug.
Thus, it follows that if a specific population of receptors is vital for mediating a physiological effect, the affinity
of an agonist for binding to those receptors should be related to the potency of that drug for causing that
physiological effect. Many drugs and most neurotransmitters can bind to more than one type of receptor, thereby
causing both desired therapeutic effects and undesired adverse effects. In order to establish a relationship between
drug occupation of a particular receptor subtype and the corresponding biological response to that drug, correlation
curves of receptor affinity and drug potency are often constructed (Figure 2.10).
Figure 2.10 Correlation of drug affinity for receptor binding and potency for causing a
physiological effect. A positive correlation should exist between the affinity (Kd value) of
a drug for binding to a specific receptor subtype and the potency (EC50 value) of that
drug to cause physiological responses mediated by that receptor population. For example,
many drugs have affinity for both α1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. The circled letters in
the figure represent agonists with varying affinities for α1 and β2 receptors. However,
from the data provided, it becomes clear that α1 receptors only mediate changes in blood
pressure, while β2 receptors only mediate changes in bronchodilation.
99
IV.  Intrinsic Activity
As mentioned above, an agonist binds to a receptor and produces a biologic response based on the concentration of
the agonist, its affinity for the receptor and, hence, the fraction of occupied receptors. However, the intrinsic activity
of a drug further determines its ability to fully or partially activate the receptors. Drugs may be categorized
according to their intrinsic activity and resulting Emax values.
100
A.  Full agonists
If a drug binds to a receptor and produces a maximal biologic response that mimics the response to the endogenous
ligand, it is a full agonist (Figure 2.11). Full agonists bind to a receptor, stabilizing the receptor in its active state and
are said to have an intrinsic activity of one. All full agonists for a receptor population should produce the same Emax.
For example, phenylephrine is a full agonist at α1-adrenoceptors, because it produces the same Emax as the
endogenous ligand, norepinephrine. Upon binding to α1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle, both
norepinephrine and phenylephrine stabilize the receptor in its active state, thereby increasing Gq activation.
Activation of Gq increases intracellular Ca2+, causing interaction of actin and myosin filaments and shortening of the
muscle cells. The diameter of the arteriole decreases, causing an increase in resistance to blood flow through the
vessel and an increase in blood pressure. Thus, effects of agonists on intracellular molecules, cells, tissues, and
intact organisms are all attributable to interaction of the drug with the receptor. For full agonists, the dose–response
curves for receptor binding and each of the biological responses should be comparable.
101
Figure 2.11 Effects of full agonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists on receptor
activity.
102
103
B.  Partial agonists
Partial agonists have intrinsic activities greater than zero but less than one (Figure 2.11). Even when all the receptors
are occupied, partial agonists cannot produce the same Emax as a full agonist. Even so, a partial agonist may have an
affinity that is greater than, less than, or equivalent to that of a full agonist. A partial agonist may also act as a partial
antagonist of a full agonist (Figure 2.12). As the number of receptors occupied by the partial agonist increases, the
number of receptors that can be occupied by the full agonist decreases and therefore Emax would decrease until it
reached the Emax of the partial agonist. This potential of partial agonists to act as both an agonist and antagonist may
have therapeutic utility. For example, aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is a partial agonist at selected
dopamine receptors. Overactive dopaminergic pathways tend to be inhibited by aripiprazole, whereas underactive
pathways are stimulated. This might explain the ability of aripiprazole to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, with
a small risk of causing extrapyramidal adverse effects (see Chapter 11).
104
105
Figure 2.12 Effects of partial agonists.
106
C.  Inverse agonists
Typically, unbound receptors are inactive and require interaction with an agonist to assume an active conformation.
However, some receptors show a spontaneous conversion from R to R* in the absence of an agonist. Inverse
agonists, unlike full agonists, stabilize the inactive R form and cause R* to convert to R. This decreases the number
of activated receptors to below that observed in the absence of drug (Figure 2.11). Thus, inverse agonists have an
intrinsic activity less than zero, reverse the activation state of receptors, and exert the opposite pharmacological
effect of agonists.
107
D.  Antagonists
Antagonists bind to a receptor with high affinity but possess zero intrinsic activity. An antagonist has no effect on
biological function in the absence of an agonist, but can decrease the effect of an agonist when present. Antagonism
may occur either by blocking the drug’s ability to bind to the receptor or by blocking its ability to activate the
receptor.
1.  Competitive antagonists
If the antagonist binds to the same site on the receptor as the agonist in a reversible manner, it is “competitive.” A
competitive antagonist interferes with an agonist binding to its receptor and maintains the receptor in its inactive
state. For example, the antihypertensive drug terazosin competes with the endogenous ligand norepinephrine at α1-
adrenoceptors, thus decreasing vascular smooth muscle tone and reducing blood pressure. However, increasing the
concentration of agonist relative to antagonist can overcome this inhibition. Thus, competitive antagonists
characteristically shift the agonist dose–response curve to the right (increased EC50) without affecting Emax (Figure
2.13).
Figure 2.13 Effects of drug antagonists. EC50 = drug dose that shows 50% of maximal
response.
2.  Irreversible antagonists
Irreversible antagonists bind covalently to the active site of the receptor, thereby permanently reducing the number
of receptors available to the agonist. An irreversible antagonist causes a downward shift of the Emax, with no shift of
EC50 values (Figure 2.13). In contrast to competitive antagonists, addition of more agonist does not overcome the
effect of irreversible antagonists. Thus, irreversible antagonists and allosteric antagonists (see below) are both
considered noncompetitive antagonists. A fundamental difference between competitive and noncompetitive
antagonists is that competitive antagonists reduce agonist potency (increase EC50) and noncompetitive antagonists
reduce agonist efficacy (decrease Emax).
3.  Allosteric antagonists
An allosteric antagonist binds to a site (allosteric site) other than the agonist-binding site and prevents receptor
activation by the agonist. This type of antagonist also causes a downward shift of the Emax of an agonist, with no
108
change in the EC50 value. An example of an allosteric agonist is picrotoxin, which binds to the inside of the GABA-
controlled chloride channel. When picrotoxin binds inside the channel, no chloride can pass through the channel,
even when GABA fully occupies the receptor.
4.  Functional antagonism
An antagonist may act at a completely separate receptor, initiating effects that are functionally opposite those of the
agonist. A classic example is the functional antagonism by epinephrine to histamine-induced bronchoconstriction.
Histamine binds to H1 histamine receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchoconstriction of the
bronchial tree. Epinephrine is an agonist at β2-adrenoceptors on bronchial smooth muscle, which causes the muscles
to relax. This functional antagonism is also known as “physiologic antagonism.”
109
V.  Quantal Dose–Response Relationships
Another important dose–response relationship is that between the dose of the drug and the proportion of a
population of patients that responds to it. These responses are known as quantal responses, because, for any
individual, either the effect occurs or it does not. Graded responses can be transformed to quantal responses by
designating a predetermined level of the graded response as the point at which a response occurs or not. For
example, a quantal dose–response relationship can be determined in a population for the antihypertensive drug
atenolol. A positive response is defined as a fall of at least 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure. Quantal dose–
response curves are useful for determining doses to which most of the population responds. They have similar
shapes as log dose–response curves, and the ED50 is the drug dose that causes a therapeutic response in half of the
population.
110
A.  Therapeutic index
The therapeutic index (TI) of a drug is the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity in half the population (TD50) to the
dose that produces a clinically desired or effective response (ED50) in half the population:
The TI is a measure of a drug’s safety, because a larger value indicates a wide margin between doses that are
effective and doses that are toxic.
111
B.  Clinical usefulness of the therapeutic index
The TI of a drug is determined using drug trials and accumulated clinical experience. These usually reveal a range of
effective doses and a different (sometimes overlapping) range of toxic doses. Although high TI values are required
for most drugs, some drugs with low therapeutic indices are routinely used to treat serious diseases. In these cases,
the risk of experiencing adverse effects is not as great as the risk of leaving the disease untreated. Figure 2.14 shows
the responses to warfarin, an oral anticoagulant with a low TI, and penicillin, an antimicrobial drug with a large TI.
Figure 2.14 Cumulative percentage of patients responding to plasma levels of warfarin
and penicillin.
112
1.  Warfarin (example of a drug with a small therapeutic index)
As the dose of warfarin is increased, a greater fraction of the patients respond (for this drug, the desired response is
a two- to threefold increase in the international normalized ratio [INR]) until, eventually, all patients respond (Figure
2.14A). However, at higher doses of warfarin, anticoagulation resulting in hemorrhage occurs in a small percent of
patients. Agents with a low TI (that is, drugs for which dose is critically important) are those drugs for which
bioavailability critically alters the therapeutic effects (see Chapter 1).
2.  Penicillin (example of a drug with a large therapeutic index)
For drugs such as penicillin (Figure 2.14B), it is safe and common to give doses in excess of that which is minimally
required to achieve a desired response without the risk of adverse effects. In this case, bioavailability does not
critically alter the therapeutic or clinical effects.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the following best describes how a drug that acts as an agonist at the A subtype of GABA receptors
affects signal transduction in a neuron?
A.  Activation of this receptor subtype alters transcription of DNA in the nucleus of the neuron.
B.  Activation of this receptor subtype opens ion channels that allow sodium to enter cells and increases the chance
of generating an action potential.
C.  Activation of this receptor subtype opens ion channels that allow chloride to enter cells and decreases the chance
of generating an action potential.
D.  Activation of this receptor subtype results in G protein activation and increased intracellular second messenger
levels.
Correct answer = C. The GABA-A receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel selective for chloride. Agonists for the
GABA-A receptor increase opening of channels, resulting in chloride entry into the neuron, hyperpolarization,
and decreased action potential events.
If 1 mg of lorazepam produces the same anxiolytic response as 10 mg of diazepam, which is correct?
A.  Lorazepam is more potent than is diazepam.
B.  Lorazepam is more efficacious than is diazepam.
C.  Lorazepam is a full agonist, and diazepam is a partial agonist.
D.  Lorazepam is a better drug to take for anxiety than is diazepam.
Correct answer = A. A drug that causes the same effect at a lower dose is more potent. B and C are incorrect
because without information about the maximal effect of these drugs, no conclusions can be made about efficacy
or intrinsic activity. D is incorrect because the maximal response obtained is often more important than the
amount of drug needed to achieve it.
If 10 mg of oxycodone produces a greater analgesic response than does aspirin at any dose, which is correct?
A.  Oxycodone is more efficacious than is aspirin.
B.  Oxycodone is less potent than is aspirin.
C.  Aspirin is a full agonist, and oxycodone is a partial agonist.
D.  Oxycodone and aspirin act on the same drug target.
Correct answer = A. Drugs with greater response at maximally effective concentrations are more efficacious than
drugs with a lower maximal response. Choice B is incorrect since no information is given about the half maximal
concentrations of either drug. Choices C and D are incorrect since it is not known if both drugs bind to the same
receptor population.
In the presence of propranolol, a higher concentration of epinephrine is required to elicit full antiasthmatic
activity. Propranolol has no effect on asthma symptoms. Which is correct regarding these medications?
A.  Epinephrine is less efficacious than is propranolol.
B.  Epinephrine is a full agonist, and propranolol is a partial agonist.
C.  Epinephrine is an agonist, and propranolol is a competitive antagonist.
D.  Epinephrine is an agonist, and propranolol is a noncompetitive antagonist.
Correct answer = C. Since propranolol decreases the effect of epinephrine but the inhibition can be overcome by
giving a higher dose of epinephrine, propranolol must be a competitive antagonist. If D were correct, even very
high concentrations of epinephrine would not be able to elicit a maximal effect in the presence of propranolol.
Since propranolol has no effect by itself, A and B are incorrect.
In the presence of picrotoxin, diazepam is less efficacious at causing sedation, regardless of the dose.
Picrotoxin has no sedative effect, even at the highest dose. Which of the following is correct regarding these
agents?
A.  Picrotoxin is a competitive antagonist.
B.  Picrotoxin is a noncompetitive antagonist.
C.  Diazepam is less efficacious than is picrotoxin.
D.  Diazepam is less potent than is picrotoxin.
Correct answer = B. Since picrotoxin decreases the maximal effect of diazepam regardless of the diazepam dose,
it is a noncompetitive antagonist. Picrotoxin has no efficacy alone, so C is incorrect. No information is provided
about potency of either drug.
Haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antipsychotic medications that bind to the D2 subtype of
dopamine receptors, with a binding affinity of haloperidol > chlorpromazine > clozapine. Which statement
would have to be correct to conclude that the mechanism of antipsychotic effects for these drugs is via
binding to D2 receptors?
114
2.7
2.8
2.9
2.10
A.  Haloperidol should have the lowest potency of the three antipsychotic drugs.
B.  D2 receptor binding should also be related to the potency of these drugs in causing Parkinson’s-like adverse
effects.
C.  A positive correlation should exist between the affinity of these drugs to bind to D2 receptors and their potency
for antipsychotic actions.
D.  Clozapine would have to be more potent than chlorpromazine for decreasing psychosis.
Correct answer = C. To conclude that the mechanism of antipsychotic effect for these drugs is via binding to D2
receptors, there should be a positive correlation between the affinity of the drugs for D2 receptors and their
potency for antipsychotic actions. Haloperidol should have the highest antipsychotic potency and clozapine the
lowest. There is no guarantee the therapeutic effects and adverse effects are mediated by the same receptor
population; therefore, a different correlation may exist for the adverse effects and D2 receptor affinity.
If there were spare β1-adrenergic receptors on cardiac muscle cells, which statement would be correct?
A.  The number of spare β1-adrenergic receptors determines the size of the maximum effect of the agonist
epinephrine.
B.  Spare β1 adrenergic receptors make the cardiac tissue less sensitive to epinephrine.
C.  A maximal effect of epinephrine is seen when only a portion of β1 adrenergic receptors are occupied.
D.  Spare receptors are active even in the absence of epinephrine.
Correct answer = C. Only a fraction of the total receptors need to be bound to elicit a maximum cellular response
when spare receptors are present. The other choices do not accurately describe the effects of having spare
receptors.
Which of the following up-regulates postsynaptic α1-adrenergic receptors?
A.  Daily use of amphetamine that causes release of norepinephrine
B.  A disease that causes an increase in the activity of norepinephrine neurons
C.  Daily use of phenylephrine, an α1 receptor agonist
D.  Daily use of prazosin, an α1 receptor antagonist
Correct answer = D. Up-regulation of receptors occurs when receptor activation is lower than normal, such as
when the receptor is continuously exposed to an antagonist for that receptor. Down-regulation of receptors occurs
when receptor activation is greater than normal because of continuous exposure to an agonist, as described in A,
B, and C.
Methylphenidate helps patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) maintain attention and
perform better at school or work, with an ED50 of 10 mg. However, methylphenidate can also cause
significant nausea at higher doses (TD50 = 30 mg). Which is correct regarding methylphenidate?
A.  The therapeutic index of methylphenidate is 3.
B.  The therapeutic index of methylphenidate is 0.3.
C.  Methylphenidate is more potent at causing nausea than treating ADHD.
D.  Methylphenidate is more efficacious at causing nausea than treating ADHD.
Correct answer = A. Therapeutic index is calculated by dividing TD50 by ED50 (30/10), making B incorrect. C is
incorrect because methylphenidate is more potent at treating ADHD (it takes a lower dose) than causing nausea.
D. No information about efficacy is provided.
Which is correct concerning the safety of using warfarin (with a small therapeutic index) versus penicillin
(with a large therapeutic index)?
A.  Warfarin is a safer drug because it has a low therapeutic index.
B.  Warfarin treatment has a high chance of resulting in dangerous adverse effects if bioavailability is altered.The
high therapeutic index makes penicillin a safe drug for all patients.
D.  Penicillin treatment has a high chance of causing dangerous adverse effects if bioavailability is altered.
Correct answer = B. Agents with a low TI (that is, drugs for which dose is critically important) are those drugs for
which bioavailability critically alters the therapeutic and adverse effects. A is incorrect, because a drug with a low
TI is not generally considered to be safe. C is incorrect because a high TI does not ensure safety across the entire
patient population. D is incorrect because the high TI makes it unlikely that bioavailability alters the incidence of
therapeutic or adverse effects.

Drugs Affecting the Autonomic Nervous System

The Autonomic Nervous System
Rajan Radhakrishnan
117
I.  Overview
The autonomic nervous system (ANS), along with the endocrine system, coordinates the regulation and integration
of bodily functions. The endocrine system sends signals to target tissues by varying the levels of blood-borne
hormones. By contrast, the nervous system exerts effects by the rapid transmission of electrical impulses over nerve
fibers that terminate at effector cells, which specifically respond to the release of neuromediator substances. Drugs
that produce their primary therapeutic effect by mimicking or altering the functions of the ANS are called autonomic
drugs and are discussed in the following four chapters. The autonomic agents act either by stimulating portions of
the ANS or by blocking the action of the autonomic nerves. This chapter outlines the fundamental physiology of the
ANS and describes the role of neurotransmitters in the communication between extracellular events and chemical
changes within the cell.
118
I.  Introduction to the Nervous System
The nervous system is divided into two anatomical divisions: the central nervous system (CNS), which is composed
of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes neurons located outside the brain
and spinal cord—that is, any nerves that enter or leave the CNS (Figure 3.1). The peripheral nervous system is
subdivided into the efferent and afferent divisions. The efferent neurons carry signals away from the brain and spinal
cord to the peripheral tissues, and the afferent neurons bring information from the periphery to the CNS. Afferent
neurons provide sensory input to modulate the function of the efferent division through reflex arcs or neural
pathways that mediate a reflex action.
Figure 3.1 Organization of the nervous system.
119
A.  Functional divisions within the nervous system
The efferent portion of the peripheral nervous system is further divided into two major functional subdivisions: the
somatic nervous system and the ANS (Figure 3.1). The somatic efferent neurons are involved in the voluntary
control of functions such as contraction of the skeletal muscles essential for locomotion. The ANS, conversely,
regulates the everyday requirements of vital bodily functions without the conscious participation of the mind.
Because of the involuntary nature of the ANS as well as its functions, it is also known as the visceral, vegetative, or
involuntary nervous system. It is composed of efferent neurons that innervate visceral smooth muscle, cardiac
muscle, vasculature, and the exocrine glands, thereby controlling digestion, cardiac output, blood flow, and
glandular secretions.
120
B.  Anatomy of the ANS
1.  Efferent neurons
The ANS carries nerve impulses from the CNS to the effector organs through two types of efferent neurons: the
preganglionic neurons and the postganglionic neurons (Figure 3.2). The cell body of the first nerve cell, the
preganglionic neuron, is located within the CNS. The preganglionic neurons emerge from the brainstem or spinal
cord and make a synaptic connection in ganglia (an aggregation of nerve cell bodies located in the peripheral
nervous system). The ganglia function as relay stations between the preganglionic neuron and the second nerve cell,
the postganglionic neuron. The cell body of the postganglionic neuron originates in the ganglion. It is generally
nonmyelinated and terminates on effector organs, such as visceral smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and the exocrine
glands.
121
Figure 3.2 Efferent neurons of the autonomic nervous system.
2.  Afferent neurons
The afferent neurons (fibers) of the ANS are important in the reflex regulation of this system (for example, by
sensing pressure in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) and in signaling the CNS to influence the efferent branch of the
system to respond.
3.  Sympathetic neurons
The efferent ANS is divided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems, as well as the enteric
nervous system (Figure 3.1). Anatomically, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic neurons originate in the CNS
and emerge from two different spinal cord regions (Figure 3.3). The preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic
122
system come from the thoracic and lumbar regions (T1 to L2) of the spinal cord, and they synapse in two cord-like
chains of ganglia that run close to and in parallel on each side of the spinal cord. The preganglionic neurons are
short in comparison to the postganglionic ones. Axons of the postganglionic neuron extend from the ganglia to
tissues they innervate and regulate (see Chapter 6). In most cases, the preganglionic nerve endings of the
sympathetic nervous system are highly branched, enabling one preganglionic neuron to interact with many
postganglionic neurons. This arrangement enables activation of numerous effector organs at the same time. [Note:
The adrenal medulla, like the sympathetic ganglia, receives preganglionic fibers from the sympathetic system. The
adrenal medulla, in response to stimulation by the ganglionic neurotransmitter acetylcholine, secretes epinephrine
(adrenaline), and lesser amounts of norepinephrine, directly into the blood.]
Figure 3.3 Autonomic nervous system.
4.  Parasympathetic neurons
The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers arise from cranial nerves III (oculomotor), VII (facial), IX
(glossopharyngeal), and X (vagus), as well as from the sacral region (S2 to S4) of the spinal cord and synapse in
ganglia near or on the effector organs. [Note: The vagus nerve accounts for 90% of preganglionic parasympathetic
fibers. Postganglionic neurons from this nerve innervate most organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavity.] Thus, in
contrast to the sympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long, and the postganglionic ones are short, with the
ganglia close to or within the organ innervated. In most instances, there is a one-to-one connection between the
preganglionic and postganglionic neurons, enabling discrete response of this system.
123
5.  Enteric neurons
The enteric nervous system is the third division of the ANS. It is a collection of nerve fibers that innervate the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas, and gallbladder, and it constitutes the “brain of the gut.” This system functions
independently of the CNS and controls motility, exocrine and endocrine secretions, and microcirculation of the GI
tract. It is modulated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
124
C.  Functions of the sympathetic nervous system
Although continually active to some degree (for example, in maintaining tone of vascular beds), the sympathetic
division is responsible for adjusting in response to stressful situations, such as trauma, fear, hypoglycemia, cold, and
exercise (Figure 3.4).
Figure 3.4 Actions of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems on effector
organs.
1.  Effects of stimulation of the sympathetic division
The effect of sympathetic stimulation is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, mobilization of energy stores,
and increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles and the heart while diverting flow from the skin and internal organs.
Sympathetic stimulation results in dilation of the pupils and bronchioles (Figure 3.4). It also reduces GI motility and
affects function of the bladder and sexual organs.
2.  Fight or flight response
The changes experienced by the body during emergencies are referred to as the “fight or flight” response (Figure
3.5). These reactions are triggered both by direct sympathetic activation of effector organs and by stimulation of the
adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and lesser amounts of norepinephrine. Hormones released by the adrenal
medulla directly enter the bloodstream and promote responses in effector organs that contain adrenergic receptors
(see Chapter 6). The sympathetic nervous system tends to function as a unit and often discharges as a complete
system, for example, during severe exercise or in reactions to fear (Figure 3.5). This system, with its diffuse
distribution of postganglionic fibers, is involved in a wide array of physiologic activities. Although it is not essential
for survival, it is essential in preparing the body to handle uncertain situations and unexpected stimuli.
125
126
Figure 3.5 Sympathetic and parasympathetic actions are elicited by different stimuli.
127
D.  Functions of the parasympathetic nervous system
The parasympathetic division is involved with maintaining homeostasis within the body. It is required for life, since
it maintains essential bodily functions, such as digestion and elimination. The parasympathetic division usually acts
to oppose or balance the actions of the sympathetic division and generally predominates the sympathetic system in
“rest-and-digest” situations. Unlike the sympathetic system, the parasympathetic system never discharges as a
complete system. If it did, it would produce massive, undesirable, and unpleasant symptoms, such as involuntary
urination and defecation. Instead, parasympathetic fibers innervating specific organs such as the gut, heart, or eye
are activated separately, and the system affects these organs individually.
128
E.  Role of the CNS in the control of autonomic functions
Although the ANS is a motor system, it does require sensory input from peripheral structures to provide information
on the current state of the body. This feedback is provided by streams of afferent impulses, originating in the viscera
and other autonomically innervated structures that travel to integrating centers in the CNS, such as the
hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. These centers respond to stimuli by sending out efferent reflex
impulses via the ANS.
1.  Reflex arcs
Most of the afferent impulses are involuntarily translated into reflex responses. For example, a fall in blood pressure
causes pressure-sensitive neurons (baroreceptors in the heart, vena cava, aortic arch, and carotid sinuses) to send
fewer impulses to cardiovascular centers in the brain. This prompts a reflex response of increased sympathetic
output to the heart and vasculature and decreased parasympathetic output to the heart, which results in a
compensatory rise in blood pressure and heart rate (Figure 3.6). [Note: In each case, the reflex arcs of the ANS
comprise a sensory (afferent) arm and a motor (efferent or effector) arm.]
129
130
Figure 3.6 Baroreceptor reflex arc response to a decrease in blood pressure.
2.  Emotions and the ANS
Stimuli that evoke strong feelings, such as rage, fear, and pleasure, can modify activities of the ANS.
131
F.  Innervation by the ANS
1.  Dual innervation
Most organs are innervated by both divisions of the ANS. Thus, vagal parasympathetic innervation slows the heart
rate, and sympathetic innervation increases heart rate. Despite this dual innervation, one system usually
predominates in controlling the activity of a given organ. For example, the vagus nerve is the predominant factor for
controlling heart rate. The dual innervation of organs is dynamic, and fine-tuned continually to maintain
homeostasis.
2.  Sympathetic innervation
Although most tissues receive dual innervation, some effector organs, such as the adrenal medulla, kidney,
pilomotor muscles, and sweat glands, receive innervation only from the sympathetic system.
132
G.  Somatic nervous system
The efferent somatic nervous system differs from the ANS in that a single myelinated motor neuron, originating in
the CNS, travels directly to skeletal muscle without the mediation of ganglia. As noted earlier, the somatic nervous
system is under voluntary control, whereas the ANS is involuntary. Responses in the somatic division are generally
faster than those in the ANS.
133
H. 
 
Summary 
of 
differences 
between 
sympathetic,
parasympathetic, and motor nerves
Major differences in the anatomical arrangement of neurons lead to variations of the functions in each division
(Figure 3.7). The sympathetic nervous system is widely distributed, innervating practically all effector systems in
the body. By contrast, the distribution of the parasympathetic division is more limited. The sympathetic
preganglionic fibers have a much broader influence than the parasympathetic fibers and synapse with a larger
number of postganglionic fibers. This type of organization permits a diffuse discharge of the sympathetic nervous
system. The parasympathetic division is more circumscribed, with mostly one-to-one interactions, and the ganglia
are also close to, or within, organs they innervate. This limits the amount of branching that can be done by this
division. [A notable exception is found in the myenteric plexus (major nerve supply to the GI tract), where one
preganglionic neuron has been shown to interact with 8000 or more postganglionic fibers.] The anatomical
arrangement of the parasympathetic system results in the distinct functions of this division. The somatic nervous
system innervates skeletal muscles. One somatic motor neuron axon is highly branched, and each branch innervates
a single muscle fiber. Thus, one somatic motor neuron may innervate 100 muscle fibers. This arrangement leads to
the formation of a motor unit. The lack of ganglia and the myelination of the motor nerves enable a fast response by
the somatic nervous system.
Figure 3.7 Characteristics of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
134
III.  Chemical Signaling Between Cells
Neurotransmission in the ANS is an example of chemical signaling between cells. In addition to neurotransmission,
other types of chemical signaling include the secretion of hormones and the release of local mediators (Figure 3.8).
Figure 3.8 Some commonly used mechanisms for transmission of regulatory signals
between cells.
135
A.  Hormones
Specialized endocrine cells secrete hormones into the bloodstream, where they travel throughout the body, exerting
effects on broadly distributed target cells (see Chapters 23 through 26).
136
B.  Local mediators
Most cells secrete chemicals that act locally on cells in the immediate environment. Because these chemical signals
are rapidly destroyed or removed, they do not enter the blood and are not distributed throughout the body. Histamine
(see Chapter 37) and prostaglandins are examples of local mediators.
137
C.  Neurotransmitters
Communication between nerve cells, and between nerve cells and effector organs, occurs through the release of
specific chemical signals (neurotransmitters) from the nerve terminals. The release is triggered by arrival of the
action potential at the nerve ending, leading to depolarization. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates fusion of
synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and release of their contents. The neurotransmitters rapidly diffuse
across the synaptic cleft, or space (synapse), between neurons and combine with specific receptors on the
postsynaptic (target) cell.
1.  Membrane receptors
All neurotransmitters, and most hormones and local mediators, are too hydrophilic to penetrate the lipid bilayers of
target cell plasma membranes. Instead, their signal is mediated by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of
target organs. [Note: A receptor is defined as a recognition site for a substance. It has a binding specificity and is
coupled to processes that eventually evoke a response. Most receptors are proteins (see Chapter 2).]
2.  Types of neurotransmitters
Although over 50 signal molecules in the nervous system have been identified, norepinephrine (and the closely
related epinephrine), acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid are most
commonly involved in the actions of therapeutically useful drugs. Each of these chemical signals binds to a specific
family of receptors. Acetylcholine and norepinephrine are the primary chemical signals in the ANS, whereas a wide
variety of neurotransmitters function in the CNS.
3.  Acetylcholine
The autonomic nerve fibers can be divided into two groups based on the type of neurotransmitter released. If
transmission is mediated by acetylcholine, the neuron is termed cholinergic (Figure 3.9 and Chapters 4 and 5).
Acetylcholine mediates the transmission of nerve impulses across autonomic ganglia in both the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems. It is the neurotransmitter at the adrenal medulla. Transmission from the
autonomic postganglionic nerves to the effector organs in the parasympathetic system, and a few sympathetic
system organs, also involves the release of acetylcholine. In the somatic nervous system, transmission at the
neuromuscular junction (the junction of nerve fibers and voluntary muscles) is also cholinergic (Figure 3.9).
Figure 3.9 Summary of the neurotransmitters released, types of receptors, and types of
neurons within the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Cholinergic neurons are
shown in red and adrenergic neurons in blue. [Note: This schematic diagram does not
show that the parasympathetic ganglia are close to or on the surface of the effector organs
and that the postganglionic fibers are usually shorter than the preganglionic fibers. By
contrast, the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system are close to the spinal cord. The
138
postganglionic fibers are long, allowing extensive branching to innervate more than one
organ system. This allows the sympathetic nervous system to discharge as a unit.]
*Epinephrine 80% and norepinephrine 20% released from adrenal medulla.
4.  Norepinephrine and epinephrine
When norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter, the fiber is termed adrenergic (Figure 3.9 and Chapters 6 and 7). In the
sympathetic system, norepinephrine mediates the transmission of nerve impulses from autonomic postganglionic
nerves to effector organs. Epinephrine secreted by the adrenal medulla (not sympathetic neurons) also acts as a
chemical messenger in the effector organs. [Note: A few sympathetic fibers, such as those involved in sweating, are
cholinergic, and, for simplicity, they are not shown in Figure 3.9.]
139
IV.  Signal Transduction in the Effector Cell
The binding of chemical signals to receptors activates enzymatic processes within the cell membrane that ultimately
results in a cellular response, such as the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins or changes in the conductivity of
ion channels (see Chapter 2). A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a signal and a receptor as a signal detector and
transducer. The receptors in the ANS effector cells are classified as adrenergic or cholinergic based on the
neurotransmitters or hormones that bind to them. Epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to adrenergic receptors, and
acetylcholine binds to cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptors are further classified as nicotinic or muscarinic.
Some receptors, such as the postsynaptic cholinergic nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscle cells, are directly linked
to membrane ion channels and are known as ionotropic receptors. Binding of neurotransmitter to ionotropic
receptors directly affects ion permeability (Figure 3.10A). All adrenergic receptors and cholinergic muscarinic
receptors are G protein–coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors). Metabotropic receptors mediate the effects of
ligands by activating a second messenger system inside the cell. The two most widely recognized second
messengers are the adenylyl cyclase system and the calcium/phosphatidylinositol system (Figure 3.10B, C).

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which is correct regarding the sympathetic nervous system?
A.  It generally mediates body functions in “rest-and-digest” mode.
B.  The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is norepinephrine (NE).
C.  The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is acetylcholine (ACh).
D.  Sympathetic neurons release ACh in the effector organs.
Correct answer = C. The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia is acetylcholine. The
sympathetic system generally mediates body functions in “fight or flight” mode, and the parasympathetic system
generally mediates body functions in “rest-and-digest” mode. Sympathetic neurons release NE, and
parasympathetic neurons release ACh in the effector cells.
Why does the somatic nervous system enable a faster response compared to the ANS?
A.  Somatic motor neurons have ganglia where neurotransmission is mediated by ACh.
B.  Somatic motor neurons have ganglia where neurotransmission is mediated by NE.
C.  Somatic motor neurons are not myelinated.
D.  Somatic motor neurons are myelinated and do not have ganglia.
Correct answer = D. Somatic motor neurons are myelinated and have no ganglia. This enables faster transmission
in the somatic neurons.
Which physiological change occurs when the parasympathetic system is activated?
A.  Increase in heart rate
B.  Inhibition of lacrimation (tears)
C.  Dilation of the pupil (mydriasis)
D.  Increase in gastric motility
Correct answer = D. Activation of the parasympathetic system causes an increase in gastric motility, increase in
fluid secretions, reduction in heart rate, and constriction of the pupil. In the “rest-and-digest” mode, the
parasympathetic system is more active, which helps with digestion.
Which physiological change is expected when the sympathetic system is inhibited using a pharmacological
agent?
A.  Reduction in heart rate
B.  Increase in blood pressure
C.  Decrease in fluid secretions
D.  Constriction of blood vessels
Correct answer = A. Activation of the sympathetic system causes an increase in heart rate, increase in blood
pressure, reduction or thickening of fluid secretions, and constriction of blood vessels. Therefore, inhibition of the
sympathetic system should theoretically cause a reduction in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, increase in
fluid secretions, and relaxation of blood vessels.
Which is correct regarding activation of receptors on the effector organs in the ANS?
A.  Acetylcholine activates muscarinic receptors.
B.  Acetylcholine activates adrenergic receptors.
C.  Epinephrine activates nicotinic receptors.
D.  Norepinephrine activates muscarinic receptors.
Correct answer = A. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system, and it activates both
muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, not adrenergic receptors. Norepinephrine and epinephrine activate
adrenergic receptors, not muscarinic receptors.
Which statement concerning the parasympathetic nervous system is correct?
A.  The parasympathetic system often discharges as a single, functional system.
B.  The parasympathetic division is involved in near vision, movement of food, and urination.
C.  The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division are long, compared to those of the sympathetic
nervous system.
D.  The parasympathetic system controls the secretion of the adrenal medulla.
Correct answer = B. The parasympathetic nervous system maintains essential bodily functions, such as vision,
movement of food, and urination. It uses acetylcholine, not norepinephrine, as a neurotransmitter, and it
discharges as discrete fibers that are activated separately. The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic system
are short compared to those of the sympathetic division. The adrenal medulla is under the control of the

Which is correct regarding neurotransmitters and neurotransmission?
A.  Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic nerve terminals.
B.  Arrival of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell triggers release of neurotransmitter.
C.  Intracellular calcium levels drop in the neuron before the release of neurotransmitter.
D.  Serotonin and dopamine are the primary neurotransmitters in the ANS.
Correct answer = A. Neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic neurons, triggered by the arrival of an action
potential in the presynaptic neuron (not in the postsynaptic cell). When an action potential arrives in the
presynaptic neuron, calcium enters the presynaptic neuron and calcium levels increase in the neuron before
neurotransmitter is released. The main neurotransmitters in the ANS are norepinephrine and acetylcholine.
An elderly man is brought to the emergency room after ingesting a large quantity of prazosin tablets, a drug
that blocks α1 adrenergic receptors, which mediate effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the blood
vessels and urinary bladder. Which symptom is most likely to be seen in this patient?
A.  Reduced heart rate (bradycardia)
B.  Dilation of blood vessels (vasorelaxation)
C.  Increased blood pressure
D.  Reduction in urinary frequency
Correct answer = B. Activation of α1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, reduction in urinary frequency, and an
increase in blood pressure, without a direct effect on the heart rate. It may cause reflex tachycardia (increase in
heart rate) in some patients. Thus blockade of α1 receptors could theoretically cause dilation of blood vessels,
reduction in blood pressure, and increase in urinary frequency. It should not cause a reduction in heart rate.
Which statement is correct regarding the autonomic nervous system?
A.  Afferent neurons carry impulses from the central nervous system (CNS) to the effector organs.
B.  Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system arise from the cranial nerves, as well as from the sacral region.
C.  When there is a sudden drop in blood pressure, the baroreceptors send signals to the brain to activate the
parasympathetic system.
D.  The heart receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation.
Correct answer = D. The heart receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Activation of
sympathetic neurons increases the heart rate and force of contraction, and activation of parasympathetic neurons
reduces the heart rate and force of contraction (slightly). Afferent neurons carry impulses from the periphery to
the CNS, and efferent neurons carry signals away from the CNS. Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic
system arise from thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, whereas the preganglionic neurons of the
parasympathetic system arise from cranial nerves and the sacral region. When there is a sudden drop in blood
pressure, the sympathetic system is activated, not the parasympathetic system.
Which is correct regarding membrane receptors and signal transduction?
A.  ANS neurotransmitters bind to membrane receptors on the effector cells, which leads to intracellular events.
B.  Cholinergic muscarinic receptors are ionotropic receptors.
C.  Cholinergic nicotinic receptors are metabotropic receptors.
D.  Metabotropic receptors activate ion channels directly.
Correct answer = A. Neurotransmitters generally bind to membrane receptors on the postsynaptic effector cells
and cause cellular effects. Acetylcholine (ACh) binds to cholinergic muscarinic receptors and activates the second
messenger pathway in effector cells, which in turn causes cellular events. Receptors that are coupled to second
messenger systems are known as metabotropic receptors. Metabotropic receptors do not directly activate ion
channels. ACh also binds to cholinergic nicotinic receptors and activates ion channels on the effector cells. The
receptors that directly activate ion channels are known as ionotropic receptors.

Cholinergic Agonists

I.  Overview
Drugs affecting the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are divided into two groups according to the type of neuron
involved in the mechanism of action. The cholinergic drugs, which are described in this and the following chapter,
act on receptors activated by acetylcholine (ACh), whereas the adrenergic drugs (Chapters 6 and 7) act on receptors
stimulated by norepinephrine or epinephrine. Cholinergic and adrenergic drugs act by either stimulating or blocking
receptors of the ANS. Figure 4.1 summarizes cholinergic agonists discussed in this chapter.
Figure 4.1 Summary of cholinergic agonists.
146
II.  The Cholinergic Neuron
The preganglionic fibers terminating in the adrenal medulla, the autonomic ganglia (both parasympathetic and
sympathetic), and the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division use ACh as a neurotransmitter (Figure
4.2). The postganglionic sympathetic division of sweat glands also uses ACh. In addition, cholinergic neurons
innervate the muscles of the somatic system and play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS).
Figure 4.2 Sites of actions of cholinergic agonists in the autonomic and somatic nervous
systems.
147
A.  Neurotransmission at cholinergic neurons
Neurotransmission in cholinergic neurons involves six sequential steps: 1) synthesis of ACh, 2) storage, 3) release,
4) binding of ACh to the receptor, 5) degradation of ACh in the synaptic cleft (the space between the nerve endings
and adjacent receptors on nerves or effector organs), and 6) recycling of choline (Figure 4.3).
Figure 4.3 Synthesis and release of acetylcholine from the cholinergic neuron. AcCoA =
acetyl coenzyme A.
1.  Synthesis of acetylcholine
Choline is transported from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm of the cholinergic neuron by an energy-
dependent carrier system that cotransports sodium and can be inhibited by the drug hemicholinium. [Note: Choline
has a quaternary nitrogen and carries a permanent positive charge and, thus, cannot diffuse through the membrane.]
The uptake of choline is the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis. Choline acetyltransferase catalyzes the reaction of
choline with acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to form ACh (an ester) in the cytosol.
2.  Storage of acetylcholine in vesicles
ACh is packaged and stored into presynaptic vesicles by an active transport process. The mature vesicle contains not
only ACh but also adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and proteoglycan. Cotransmission from autonomic neurons is the
rule rather than the exception. This means that most synaptic vesicles contain the primary neurotransmitter (here,
ACh) as well as a cotransmitter (here, ATP) that increases or decreases the effect of the primary neurotransmitter.
3.  Release of acetylcholine
When an action potential propagated by voltage-sensitive sodium channels arrives at a nerve ending, voltage-
sensitive calcium channels on the presynaptic membrane open, causing an increase in the concentration of
intracellular calcium. Elevated calcium levels promote the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the cell membrane and
the release of contents into the synaptic space. This release can be blocked by botulinum toxin. In contrast, the toxin
in black widow spider venom causes all the ACh stored in synaptic vesicles to empty into the synaptic gap.
4.  Binding to the receptor
ACh released from the synaptic vesicles diffuses across the synaptic space and binds to postsynaptic receptors on the
target cell, to presynaptic receptors on the membrane of the neuron that released ACh, or to other targeted
presynaptic receptors. The postsynaptic cholinergic receptors on the surface of effector organs are divided into two
classes: muscarinic and nicotinic (Figure 4.2). Binding to a receptor leads to a biologic response within the cell, such
as the initiation of a nerve impulse in a postganglionic fiber or activation of specific enzymes in effector cells, as
148
mediated by second messenger molecules.
5.  Degradation of acetylcholine
The signal at the postjunctional effector site is rapidly terminated, because acetylcholinesterase (AChE) cleaves ACh
to choline and acetate in the synaptic cleft.
6.  Recycling of choline
Choline may be recaptured by a sodium-coupled, high-affinity uptake system that transports the molecule back into
the neuron. There, it is available to be acetylated into ACh.
149
III.  Cholinergic Receptors (Cholinoceptors)
Two families of cholinoceptors, designated muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, can be distinguished from each other
on the basis of their different affinities for agents that mimic the action of ACh (cholinomimetic agents).
150
A.  Muscarinic receptors
Muscarinic receptors belong to the class of G-protein–coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors). These receptors,
in addition to binding ACh, also recognize muscarine, an alkaloid in certain poisonous mushrooms. By contrast, the
muscarinic receptors show only a weak affinity for nicotine, an alkaloid found in tobacco and other plants (Figure
4.4A). There are five subclasses of muscarinic receptors; however, only M1, M2, and M3 receptors have been
functionally characterized.
Figure 4.4 Types of cholinergic receptors.
1.  Location of muscarinic receptors
These receptors are found on the autonomic effector organs, such as the heart, smooth muscle, brain, and exocrine
151
glands. Although all five subtypes are found on neurons, M1 receptors are also found on gastric parietal cells, M2
receptors on cardiac cells and smooth muscle, and M3 receptors on the bladder, exocrine glands, and smooth muscle.
[Note: Drugs with muscarinic actions preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors on these tissues, but at high
concentration, they may show some activity at nicotinic receptors.]
2.  Mechanism of acetylcholine signal transduction
A number of different molecular mechanisms transmit the signal generated by ACh occupation of the receptor. For
example, when M1 or M3 receptors are activated, the receptor undergoes a conformational change and interacts with
a G-protein that activates phospholipase C. This ultimately leads to production of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-
trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Calcium can then interact
to stimulate or inhibit enzymes or to cause hyperpolarization, secretion, or contraction. DAG activates protein kinase
C, an enzyme that phosphorylates numerous proteins within the cell. In contrast, activation of the M2 subtype on the
cardiac muscle stimulates a G-protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase and increases K+ conductance. The heart
responds with a decrease in rate and force of contraction.
3.  Muscarinic agonists
Pilocarpine is a nonselective muscarinic agonist used to treat xerostomia and glaucoma. Attempts are currently
underway to develop muscarinic agents that are directed against specific receptor subtypes.
152
B.  Nicotinic receptors
These receptors, in addition to binding ACh, also recognize nicotine but show only a weak affinity for muscarine
(Figure 4.4B). The nicotinic receptor is composed of five subunits, and it functions as a ligand-gated ion channel
(ionotropic receptor). Binding of two ACh molecules elicits a conformational change that allows the entry of sodium
ions, resulting in the depolarization of the effector cell. Nicotine at low concentration stimulates the receptor,
whereas nicotine at high concentration blocks the receptor. Nicotinic receptors are located in the CNS, the adrenal
medulla, autonomic ganglia, and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in skeletal muscles. Those at the NMJ are
sometimes designated NM, and the others, NN. The nicotinic receptors of autonomic ganglia differ from those of the
NMJ. For example, ganglionic receptors are selectively blocked by mecamylamine, whereas NMJ receptors are
specifically blocked by atracurium.
153
IV.  Direct-Acting Cholinergic Agonists
Cholinergic agonists mimic the effects of ACh by binding directly to cholinoceptors (muscarinic or nicotinic). These
agents may be broadly classified into two groups: 1) choline esters, which include endogenous ACh and synthetic
esters of choline, such as carbachol and bethanechol, and 2) naturally occurring alkaloids, such as nicotine and
pilocarpine (Figure 4.5). All direct-acting cholinergic drugs have a longer duration of action than ACh. The more
therapeutically useful drugs (pilocarpine and bethanechol) preferentially bind to muscarinic receptors and are
sometimes referred to as muscarinic agents. However, as a group, the direct-acting agonists show little specificity in
their actions, which limits clinical usefulness.
154
155
Figure 4.5 Comparison of the structures of some cholinergic agonists.
156
A.  Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine [ah-see-teel-KOE-leen] is a quaternary ammonium compound that cannot penetrate membranes.
Although it is the neurotransmitter of parasympathetic and somatic nerves as well as autonomic ganglia, it lacks
therapeutic importance because of its multiplicity of actions (leading to diffuse effects) and its rapid inactivation by
the cholinesterases. ACh has both muscarinic and nicotinic activity. Its actions include the following:
1.  Decrease in heart rate and cardiac output
The actions of ACh on the heart mimic the effects of vagal stimulation. For example, if injected intravenously, ACh
produces a brief decrease in cardiac rate (bradycardia) and cardiac output, mainly because of a reduction in the rate
of firing at the sinoatrial (SA) node. [Note: Normal vagal activity regulates the heart by the release of ACh at the SA
node.]
2.  Decrease in blood pressure
Injection of ACh causes vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure by an indirect mechanism of action. ACh
activates M3 receptors found on endothelial cells lining the smooth muscles of blood vessels. This results in the
production of nitric oxide from arginine. Nitric oxide then diffuses to vascular smooth muscle cells to stimulate
protein kinase G production, leading to hyperpolarization and smooth muscle relaxation via phosphodiesterase-3
inhibition. In the absence of administered cholinergic agents, the vascular cholinergic receptors have no known
function, because ACh is never released into the blood in significant quantities. Atropine blocks these muscarinic
receptors and prevents ACh from producing vasodilation.
3.  Other actions
In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, acetylcholine increases salivary secretion, increases gastric acid secretion, and
stimulates intestinal secretions and motility. It also enhances bronchiolar secretions and causes bronchoconstriction.
[Note: Methacholine, a direct-acting cholinergic agonist, is used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma due to its
bronchoconstricting properties.] In the genitourinary tract, ACh increases the tone of the detrusor muscle, causing
urination. In the eye, ACh is involved in stimulation of ciliary muscle contraction for near vision and in the
constriction of the pupillae sphincter muscle, causing miosis (marked constriction of the pupil). ACh (1% solution)
is instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye to produce miosis during ophthalmic surgery.
157
B.  Bethanechol
Bethanechol [be-THAN-e-kole] is an unsubstituted carbamoyl ester, structurally related to ACh (Figure 4.5). It is
not hydrolyzed by AChE due to the esterification of carbamic acid, although it is inactivated through hydrolysis by
other esterases. It lacks nicotinic actions (due to addition of the methyl group), but does have strong muscarinic
activity. Its major actions are on the smooth musculature of the bladder and GI tract. It has about a 1-hour duration
of action.
1.  Actions
Bethanechol directly stimulates muscarinic receptors, causing increased intestinal motility and tone. It also
stimulates the detrusor muscle of the bladder, whereas the trigone and sphincter muscles are relaxed. These effects
stimulate urination.
2.  Therapeutic uses
In urologic treatment, bethanechol is used to stimulate the atonic bladder, particularly in postpartum or
postoperative, nonobstructive urinary retention. Bethanechol may also be used to treat neurogenic atony as well as
megacolon.
3.  Adverse effects
Bethanechol can cause generalized cholinergic stimulation (Figure 4.6), with sweating, salivation, flushing,
decreased blood pressure (with reflex tachycardia), nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Atropine
sulfate may be administered to overcome severe cardiovascular or bronchoconstrictor responses to this agent.
158
Figure 4.6 Some adverse effects observed with cholinergic agonists.
159
160
C.  Carbachol (carbamylcholine)
Carbachol [KAR-ba-kole] has both muscarinic and nicotinic actions. Like bethanechol, carbachol is an ester of
carbamic acid (Figure 4.5) and a poor substrate for AChE. It is biotransformed by other esterases, but at a much
slower rate.
1.  Actions
Carbachol has profound effects on both the cardiovascular and GI systems because of its ganglion-stimulating
activity, and it may first stimulate and then depress these systems. It can cause release of epinephrine from the
adrenal medulla by its nicotinic action. Locally instilled into the eye, it mimics the effects of ACh, causing miosis
and a spasm of accommodation in which the ciliary muscle of the eye remains in a constant state of contraction. The
vision becomes fixed at some particular distance, making it impossible to focus (Figure 4.7). [Note the opposing
effects of atropine, a muscarinic blocker, on the eye.]
Figure 4.7 Actions of pilocarpine, carbachol, and atropine on the iris and ciliary muscle
of the eye.
161
2.  Therapeutic uses
Because of its high potency, receptor nonselectivity, and relatively long duration of action, carbachol is rarely used.
Intraocular use provides miosis for eye surgery and lowers intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma.
3.  Adverse effects
With ophthalmologic use, few adverse effects occur due to lack of systemic penetration (quaternary amine).
162
D.  Pilocarpine
The alkaloid pilocarpine [pye-loe-KAR-peen] is a tertiary amine and is stable to hydrolysis by AChE (Figure 4.5).
Compared with ACh and its derivatives, it is far less potent but is uncharged and can penetrate the CNS at
therapeutic doses. Pilocarpine exhibits muscarinic activity and is used primarily in ophthalmology.
1.  Actions
Applied topically to the eye, pilocarpine produces rapid miosis, contraction of the ciliary muscle, and spasm of
accommodation. Pilocarpine is one of the most potent stimulators of secretions such as sweat, tears, and saliva, but
its use for producing these effects has been limited due to its lack of selectivity.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Pilocarpine is used to treat glaucoma and is the drug of choice for emergency lowering of intraocular pressure of
both open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Pilocarpine is extremely effective in opening the trabecular meshwork
around the Schlemm canal, causing an immediate drop in intraocular pressure because of the increased drainage of
aqueous humor. This action occurs within a few minutes, lasts 4 to 8 hours, and can be repeated. [Note: Topical
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide and β-adrenergic blockers such as timolol, are effective in
treating glaucoma but are not used for emergency lowering of intraocular pressure.] The miotic action of pilocarpine
is also useful in reversing mydriasis due to atropine.
The drug is beneficial in promoting salivation in patients with xerostomia resulting from irradiation of the head
and neck. Sjögren syndrome, which is characterized by dry mouth and lack of tears, is treated with oral pilocarpine
tablets and cevimeline, a cholinergic drug that also has the drawback of being nonspecific.
3.  Adverse effects
Pilocarpine can cause blurred vision, night blindness, and brow ache. Poisoning with this agent is characterized by
exaggeration of various parasympathetic effects, including profuse sweating (diaphoresis) and salivation. The effects
are similar to those produced by consumption of mushrooms of the genus Inocybe, which contain muscarine.
Parenteral atropine, at doses that can cross the blood–brain barrier, is administered to counteract the toxicity of
pilocarpine.
163
V.  Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Anticholinesterase
Agents (Reversible)
AChE is an enzyme that specifically cleaves ACh to acetate and choline and, thus, terminates its actions. It is located
both pre- and postsynaptically in the nerve terminal where it is membrane bound. Inhibitors of AChE
(anticholinesterase agents or cholinesterase inhibitors) indirectly provide cholinergic action by preventing the
degradation of ACh. This results in an accumulation of ACh in the synaptic space (Figure 4.8). Therefore, these
drugs can provoke a response at all cholinoceptors, including both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors of the ANS, as
well as at the NMJ and in the brain. The reversible AChE inhibitors can be broadly classified as short-acting or
intermediate-acting agents.
Figure 4.8 Mechanisms of action of indirect cholinergic agonists. AChE =
acetylcholinesterase.
164
A.  Edrophonium
Edrophonium [ed-row-FOE-nee-um] is the prototype short-acting AChE inhibitor. Edrophonium binds reversibly to
the active center of AChE, preventing hydrolysis of ACh. It has a short duration of action of 10 to 20 minutes due to
rapid renal elimination. Edrophonium is a quaternary amine, and its actions are limited to the periphery. It is used in
the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies to the nicotinic receptor at the
NMJ. This causes the degradation of the nicotinic receptors, making fewer receptors available for interaction with
ACh. Intravenous injection of edrophonium leads to a rapid increase in muscle strength in patients with myasthenia
gravis. Care must be taken, because excess drug may provoke a cholinergic crisis (atropine is the antidote).
Edrophonium may also be used to assess cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, for differentiating cholinergic and
myasthenic crises, and for reversing the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) after surgery.
Due to the availability of other agents, edrophonium use has become limited.
165
B.  Physostigmine
Physostigmine [fi-zoe-STIG-meen] is a nitrogenous carbamic acid ester found naturally in plants and is a tertiary
amine. It is a substrate for AChE, and it forms a relatively stable carbamoylated intermediate with the enzyme,
which then becomes reversibly inactivated. The result is potentiation of cholinergic activity throughout the body.
1.  Actions
Physostigmine has a wide range of effects and stimulates not only the muscarinic and nicotinic sites of the ANS, but
also the nicotinic receptors of the NMJ. Muscarinic stimulation can cause contraction of GI smooth muscles, miosis,
bradycardia, and hypotension (Figure 4.9). Nicotinic stimulation can cause skeletal muscle twitches, fasciculations,
and skeletal muscle paralysis (at higher doses). Its duration of action is about 30 minutes to 2 hours, and it is
considered an intermediate-acting agent. Physostigmine can enter and stimulate the cholinergic sites in the CNS.
Figure 4.9 Some actions of physostigmine.
166
2.  Therapeutic uses
Physostigmine is used in the treatment of overdoses of drugs with anticholinergic actions, such as atropine, and to
reverse the effects of NMBs.
3.  Adverse effects
High doses of physostigmine may lead to convulsions. Bradycardia and a fall in cardiac output may also occur.
Inhibition of AChE at the NMJ causes the accumulation of ACh and, ultimately through continuous depolarization,
results in paralysis of skeletal muscle. However, these effects are rarely seen with therapeutic doses.
167
C.  Neostigmine
Neostigmine [nee-oh-STIG-meen] is a synthetic compound that is also a carbamic acid ester, and it reversibly
inhibits AChE in a manner similar to physostigmine.
1.  Actions
Unlike physostigmine, neostigmine has a quaternary nitrogen. Therefore, it is more polar, is absorbed poorly from
the GI tract, and does not enter the CNS. Its effect on skeletal muscle is greater than physostigmine, and it can
stimulate contractility before it paralyzes. Neostigmine has an intermediate duration of action, usually 30 minutes to
2 hours.
2.  Therapeutic uses
It is used to stimulate the bladder and GI tract and as an antidote for competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents.
Neostigmine is also used to manage symptoms of myasthenia gravis.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of neostigmine include those of generalized cholinergic stimulation, such as salivation, flushing,
decreased blood pressure, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Neostigmine does not cause CNS
side effects and is not used to overcome toxicity of central-acting antimuscarinic agents such as atropine.
Neostigmine is contraindicated when intestinal or urinary bladder obstruction is present.
168
D.  Pyridostigmine
Pyridostigmine [peer-id-oh-STIG-meen] is another cholinesterase inhibitor used in the chronic management of
myasthenia gravis. Its duration of action is intermediate (3 to 6 hours) but longer than that of neostigmine. Adverse
effects are similar to those of neostigmine.
169
E.  Tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine
Patients with Alzheimer disease have a deficiency of cholinergic neurons and therefore lower levels of ACh in the
CNS. This observation led to the development of anticholinesterases as possible remedies for the loss of cognitive
function. Tacrine [TAK-reen], the first agent in this category, has been replaced by others because of its
hepatotoxicity. Despite the ability of donepezil [doe-NEP-e-zil], rivastigmine [ri-va-STIG-meen], and galantamine
[ga-LAN-ta-meen] to delay the progression of Alzheimer disease, none can stop its progression. GI distress is their
primary adverse effect (see Chapter 8).
170
VI.  Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Anticholinesterase
Agents (Irreversible)
A number of synthetic organophosphate compounds have the ability to bind covalently to AChE. The result is a
long-lasting increase in ACh at all sites where it is released. Many of these drugs are extremely toxic and were
developed by the military as nerve agents. Related compounds, such as parathion and malathion, are used as
insecticides.
171
A.  Echothiophate
1.  Mechanism of action
Echothiophate [ek-oe-THI-oh-fate] is an organophosphate that covalently binds via its phosphate group at the active
site of AChE (Figure 4.10). Once this occurs, the enzyme is permanently inactivated, and restoration of AChE
activity requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules. Following covalent modification of AChE, the
phosphorylated enzyme slowly releases one of its ethyl groups. The loss of an alkyl group, which is called aging,
makes it impossible for chemical reactivators, such as pralidoxime, to break the bond between the remaining drug
and the enzyme.
172
173
Figure 4.10 Covalent modification of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate. Also shown
is the reactivation of the enzyme with pralidoxime (2-PAM). R = (CH3)3N+–CH2–CH2–;
RSH = (CH3)3N+–CH2–CH2–S-H.
2.  Actions
Actions include generalized cholinergic stimulation, paralysis of motor function (causing breathing difficulties), and
convulsions. Echothiophate produces intense miosis and, thus, has found therapeutic use. Intraocular pressure falls
from the facilitation of outflow of aqueous humor. Atropine in high dosages can reverse many of the peripheral and
some of the central muscarinic effects of echothiophate.
3.  Therapeutic uses
A topical ophthalmic solution of the drug is available for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. However,
echothiophate is rarely used due to its side effect profile, which includes the risk of cataracts. Figure 4.11
summarizes actions of some cholinergic agonists.
Figure 4.11 Summary of actions of some cholinergic agonists. CNS = central nervous
system.
174
VII.  Toxicology of Anticholinesterase Agents
Irreversible AChE inhibitors (mostly organophosphate compounds) are commonly used as agricultural insecticides
in the United States, which has led to numerous cases of accidental poisoning with these agents. In addition, they are
frequently used for suicidal and homicidal purposes. Organophosphate nerve gases such as sarin are used as agents
of warfare and chemical terrorism. Toxicity with these agents is manifested as nicotinic and muscarinic signs and
symptoms (cholinergic crisis). Depending on the agent, the effects can be peripheral or can affect the whole body.
175
A.  Reactivation of acetylcholinesterase
Pralidoxime [pral-i-DOX-eem] (2-PAM) can reactivate inhibited AChE (Figure 4.10). However, it is unable to
penetrate into the CNS and therefore is not useful in treating the CNS effects of organophosphates. The presence of
a charged group allows it to approach an anionic site on the enzyme, where it essentially displaces the phosphate
group of the organophosphate and regenerates the enzyme. If given before aging of the alkylated enzyme occurs, it
can reverse both muscarinic and nicotinic peripheral effects of organophosphates, but not the CNS effects. With the
newer nerve agents that produce aging of the enzyme complex within seconds, pralidoxime is less effective. In
addition, it cannot overcome toxicity of reversible AChE inhibitors (for example, physostigmine).
176
B.  Other treatments
Atropine is administered to prevent muscarinic side effects of these agents. Such effects include increased bronchial
and salivary secretion, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. Diazepam is also administered to reduce the persistent
convulsion caused by these agents. General supportive measures, such as maintenance of patent airway, oxygen
supply, and artificial respiration, may be necessary as well.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Botulinum toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals. Which is a possible
effect of botulinum toxin?
A.  Skeletal muscle paralysis
B.  Improvement of myasthenia gravis symptoms
C.  Increased salivation
D.  Reduced heart rate
Correct answer = A. Acetylcholine released by cholinergic neurons acts on nicotinic receptors in the skeletal
muscle cells to cause contraction. Therefore, blockade of ACh release causes skeletal muscle paralysis.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease where antibodies are produced against nicotinic receptors and
inactivate nicotinic receptors. A reduction in ACh release therefore worsens (not improves) the symptoms of this
condition. Reduction in ACh release by botulinum toxin causes reduction in secretions including saliva (not
increase in salivation), causing dry mouth and an increase (not reduction) in heart rate due to reduced vagal
activity.
A patient develops urinary retention after an abdominal surgery. Urinary obstruction was ruled out in this
patient. Which strategy would be helpful in promoting urination?
A.  Activating nicotinic receptors
B.  Inhibiting the release of acetylcholine
C.  Inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme
D.  Blocking muscarinic receptors
Correct answer = C. Activation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder can promote
urination in patients where the tone of detrusor muscle is low. Inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme increases the
levels of acetylcholine, and acetylcholine can increase the tone of the detrusor muscle. There are no nicotinic
receptors in the detrusor muscle; therefore, activation of nicotinic receptors is not helpful. Inhibiting the release of
acetylcholine or blocking muscarinic receptors worsens urinary retention.
Which of the following drugs could theoretically improve asthma symptoms?
A.  Bethanechol
B.  Pilocarpine
C.  Pyridostigmine
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = D. Muscarinic agonists and drugs that increase acetylcholine levels cause constriction of
bronchial smooth muscles and could exacerbate asthma symptoms. Bethanechol and pilocarpine are muscarinic
agonists, and pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases levels of acetylcholine. Atropine is a
muscarinic antagonist and therefore does not exacerbate asthma. Theoretically, it should relieve symptoms of
asthma (not used clinically for this purpose).
If an ophthalmologist wants to dilate the pupils for an eye examination, which drug/class of drugs is
theoretically useful?
A.  Muscarinic receptor activator (agonist)
B.  Muscarinic receptor inhibitor (antagonist)
C.  Pilocarpine
D.  Neostigmine
Correct answer = B. Muscarinic agonists (for example, pilocarpine) contract the circular smooth muscles in the
iris sphincter and constrict the pupil (miosis). Anticholinesterases (for example, neostigmine, physostigmine) also
cause miosis by increasing the level of ACh. Muscarinic antagonists, on the other hand, relax the circular smooth
muscles in the iris sphincter and cause dilation of the pupil (mydriasis).
In Alzheimer disease, there is a deficiency of cholinergic neuronal function in the brain. Theoretically, which
strategy is useful in treating symptoms of Alzheimer disease?
A.  Inhibiting cholinergic receptors in the brain
B.  Inhibiting the release of acetylcholine in the brain
C.  Inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain
D.  Activating the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain
Correct answer = C. Because there is already a deficiency in brain cholinergic function in Alzheimer disease,
inhibiting cholinergic receptors or inhibiting the release of ACh worsens the condition. Activating the
acetylcholinesterase enzyme increases the degradation of ACh, which also worsens the condition. However,
inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme helps to increase the levels of ACh in the brain and thereby relieve the
symptoms of Alzheimer disease.

An elderly female who lives in a farmhouse was brought to the emergency room in serious condition after
ingesting a liquid from an unlabeled bottle found near her bed, apparently in a suicide attempt. She presented
with diarrhea, frequent urination, convulsions, breathing difficulties, constricted pupils (miosis), and
excessive salivation. Which of the following is correct regarding this patient?
A.  She most likely consumed an organophosphate pesticide.
B.  The symptoms are consistent with sympathetic activation.
C.  Her symptoms can be treated using an anticholinesterase agent.
D.  Her symptoms can be treated using a cholinergic agonist.
Correct answer = A. The symptoms are consistent with that of cholinergic crisis. Since the elderly female lives on
a farm and the symptoms are consistent with a cholinergic crisis (usually caused by cholinesterase inhibitors), it
may be assumed that she has consumed an organophosphate pesticide (irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor).
Assuming that the symptoms are caused by organophosphate poisoning, administering an anticholinesterase agent
or a cholinergic agonist will worsen the condition. The symptoms are not consistent with that of sympathetic
activation, as sympathetic activation will cause symptoms opposite to that of cholinergic crisis seen in this
patient.
A patient who received a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker (NMB) for skeletal muscle relaxation
during surgery is experiencing mild skeletal muscle paralysis after the surgery. Which drug could reverse
this effect of NMBs?
A.  Pilocarpine
B.  Bethanechol
C.  Neostigmine
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = C. Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking nicotinic receptors on the skeletal muscles.
Increasing the levels of ACh in the neuromuscular junctions can reverse the effects of NMBs. Therefore,
neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, could reverse the effects of NMBs. Pilocarpine and bethanechol are
preferentially muscarinic agonists and have no effects on the nicotinic receptors. Atropine is a muscarinic
antagonist and has no effects on nicotinic receptors.
A 60-year-old female who had a cancerous growth in the neck region underwent radiation therapy. Her
salivary secretion was reduced due to radiation and she suffers from dry mouth (xerostomia). Which drug
would be most useful in treating xerostomia in this patient?
A.  Acetylcholine
B.  Pilocarpine
C.  Echothiophate
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = B. Salivary secretion may be enhanced by activating muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands.
This can be achieved in theory by using a muscarinic agonist or an anticholinesterase agent. Pilocarpine is a
muscarinic agonist administered orally for this purpose. Acetylcholine has similar effects as that of pilocarpine;
however, it cannot be used therapeutically as it is rapidly destroyed by cholinesterase in the body. Echothiophate
is an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor, but it cannot be used therapeutically because of its toxic effects.
Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and worsens dry mouth.
A 40-year-old male presents to his family physician with drooping eyelids, difficulty chewing and
swallowing, and muscle fatigue even on mild exertion. Which agent could be used to diagnose myasthenia
gravis in this patient?
A.  Atropine
B.  Edrophonium
C.  Pralidoxime
D.  Echothiophate
Correct answer = B. The function of nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscles is diminished in myasthenia gravis
due to the development of antibodies to nicotinic receptors (autoimmune disease). Any drug that increases levels
of ACh in the neuromuscular junction can improve symptoms in myasthenia gravis. Thus, edrophonium, a
reversible cholinesterase inhibitor with a short duration of action can temporarily improve skeletal muscle
weakness in myasthenia gravis, serving as a diagnostic tool. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and has no role
in skeletal muscle function. Pralidoxime is a drug that is used to reverse the binding of irreversible cholinesterase
inhibitors with cholinesterase enzyme and helps to reactivate cholinesterase enzyme. Hence, pralidoxime will not
be useful in improving skeletal muscle function in myasthenia gravis.
Atropa belladonna is a plant that contains atropine (a muscarinic antagonist). Which of the following drugs
or classes of drugs will be most useful in treating poisoning with belladonna?
A.  Malathion
B.  Physostigmine
C.  Muscarinic antagonists
D.  Nicotinic antagonists
179
Correct answer = B. Atropine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist that causes anticholinergic effects.
Muscarinic agonists or any other drugs that increase the levels of ACh are able to counteract effects of atropine.
Thus, anticholinesterases such as malathion and physostigmine can counteract the effects of atropine, in theory.
However, since malathion is an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, it is not used for systemic treatment
in patients. Muscarinic antagonists worsen the toxicity of atropine. Nicotinic antagonists can worsen the toxicity
by acting on parasympathetic ganglionic receptors and thus reducing the release of ACh.

Cholinergic Antagonists
Rajan Radhakrishnan and Carinda Feild
181
I.  Overview
Cholinergic antagonist is a general term for agents that bind to cholinoceptors (muscarinic or nicotinic) and prevent
the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) and other cholinergic agonists. The most clinically useful of these agents are
selective blockers of muscarinic receptors. They are commonly known as anticholinergic agents (a misnomer, as
they antagonize only muscarinic receptors), antimuscarinic agents (more accurate terminology), or
parasympatholytics. The effects of parasympathetic innervation are thus, interrupted by these agents, and the actions
of sympathetic innervation are left unopposed. A second group of drugs, the ganglionic blockers, shows a preference
for nicotinic receptors of the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. Clinically, they are the least important
cholinergic antagonists. A third family of compounds, the neuromuscular blocking agents (mostly nicotinic
antagonists), interfere with transmission of efferent impulses to skeletal muscles. These drugs are used as skeletal
muscle relaxants in surgical anesthesia and as agents to facilitate intubation in surgical and critical care patients.
Figure 5.1 summarizes the cholinergic antagonists discussed in this chapter.
182
Figure 5.1 Summary of selected cholinergic antagonists.
183
II.  Antimuscarinic Agents
Commonly known as anticholinergic drugs, these agents (for example, atropine and scopolamine) block muscarinic
receptors (Figure 5.2), causing inhibition of muscarinic functions. In addition, these drugs block the few exceptional
sympathetic neurons that are cholinergic, such as those innervating the salivary and sweat glands. Because they do
not block nicotinic receptors, the anticholinergic drugs (more precisely, antimuscarinic drugs) have little or no action
at skeletal neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) or autonomic ganglia. The anticholinergic drugs are beneficial in a
variety of clinical situations. [Note: A number of antihistamines and antidepressants (mainly tricyclic
antidepressants) also have antimuscarinic activity.]
Figure 5.2 Sites of action of cholinergic antagonists.
184
A.  Atropine
Atropine [A-troe-peen] is a tertiary amine extracted from belladonna alkaloid. It has a high affinity for muscarinic
receptors and binds competitively to prevent ACh from binding (Figure 5.3). Atropine acts both centrally and
peripherally. General actions last about 4 hours; however, effects of topical administration in the eye may persist for
days. Neuroeffector organs have varying sensitivity to atropine. The greatest inhibitory effects are seen in bronchial
tissue, salivary and sweat glands, and the heart.
Figure 5.3 Competition of atropine and scopolamine with acetylcholine for the
muscarinic receptor.
1.  Actions
a.  Eye
Atropine blocks muscarinic activity in the eye, resulting in mydriasis (dilation of the pupil), unresponsiveness to
light, and cycloplegia (inability to focus for near vision). In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, intraocular
pressure may rise dangerously.
b.  Gastrointestinal (GI)
Atropine (as the active isomer, L-hyoscyamine [hi-oh-SYE-uh-meen]) can be used as an antispasmodic to reduce
activity of the GI tract. Atropine and scopolamine (discussed below) are probably the most potent antispasmodic
drugs available. Although gastric motility is reduced, hydrochloric acid production is not significantly affected.
Thus, atropine is not effective for the treatment of ulcers. Doses of atropine that reduce spasms also reduce saliva
secretion, ocular accommodation, and urination. These effects decrease compliance with atropine.
c.  Cardiovascular
Atropine produces divergent effects on the cardiovascular system, depending on the dose (Figure 5.4). At low doses,
the predominant effect is a slight decrease in heart rate. This effect results from blockade of M1 receptors on the
inhibitory prejunctional (or presynaptic) neurons, thus permitting increased ACh release. Higher doses of atropine
cause a progressive increase in heart rate by blocking M2 receptors on the sinoatrial node.
185
Figure 5.4 Dose-dependent effects of atropine.
d.  Secretions
Atropine blocks muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands, producing dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). The
salivary glands are exquisitely sensitive to atropine. Sweat and lacrimal glands are similarly affected. [Note:
Inhibition of secretions of sweat glands can cause elevated body temperature, which can be dangerous in children
and the elderly.]
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Ophthalmic
Topical atropine exerts both mydriatic and cycloplegic effects, and it permits the measurement of refractive errors
without interference by the accommodative capacity of the eye. Shorter-acting antimuscarinics (cyclopentolate [sye-
kloe-PEN-toe-late] and tropicamide [troe-PIK-a-mide]) have largely replaced atropine due to prolonged mydriasis
observed with atropine (7 to 14 days vs. 6 to 24 hours with other agents). [Note: Phenylephrine or similar α-
adrenergic drugs are preferred for pupillary dilation if cycloplegia is not required.]
b.  Antispasmodic
Atropine is used as an antispasmodic agent to relax the GI tract.
c.  Cardiovascular
Injectable atropine is used to treat bradycardia of varying etiologies.
d.  Antisecretory
Atropine is sometimes used as an antisecretory agent to block secretions in the respiratory tract prior to surgery.
[Note: Glycopyrrolate (see below) is also used for this indication.]
e.  Antidote for cholinergic agonists
186
Atropine is used for the treatment of organophosphate (insecticides, nerve gases) poisoning, of overdose of clinically
used anticholinesterases such as physostigmine, and in some types of mushroom poisoning (certain mushrooms
contain cholinergic substances that block cholinesterases). Massive doses of injectable atropine may be required
over a long period to counteract the poisons. The ability of atropine to enter the central nervous system (CNS) is of
particular importance in treating central toxic effects of anticholinesterases.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Atropine is readily absorbed, partially metabolized by the liver, and eliminated primarily in urine. It has a half-life of
about 4 hours.
4.  Adverse effects
Depending on the dose, atropine may cause dry mouth, blurred vision, “sandy eyes,” tachycardia, urinary retention,
and constipation. Effects on the CNS include restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, and delirium, which may
progress to depression, collapse of the circulatory and respiratory systems, and death. Low doses of cholinesterase
inhibitors, such as physostigmine, may be used to overcome atropine toxicity. Atropine may also induce
troublesome urinary retention. The drug may be dangerous in children, because they are sensitive to its effects,
particularly to rapid increases in body temperature.
187
B.  Scopolamine
Scopolamine [skoe-POL-a-meen], another tertiary amine plant alkaloid, produces peripheral effects similar to those
of atropine. However, scopolamine has greater action on the CNS (unlike atropine, CNS effects are observed at
therapeutic doses) and a longer duration of action as compared to atropine. It has some special actions as indicated
below.
1.  Actions
Scopolamine is one of the most effective drugs available for motion sickness (Figure 5.5). It also has the unusual
effect of blocking short-term memory. In contrast to atropine, scopolamine produces sedation, but at higher doses, it
can produce excitement. Scopolamine may produce euphoria and is susceptible to abuse.
Figure 5.5 Scopolamine is an effective agent for motion sickness.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Scopolamine is used for the prevention of motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. For motion
sickness, it is available as a topical patch that provides effects for up to 3 days. [Note: As with all drugs used for
motion sickness, it is much more effective prophylactically than for treating motion sickness once it occurs.]
3.  Pharmacokinetics and adverse effects
These aspects are similar to those of atropine, with the exception of longer half-life.
188
C.  Aclidinium, glycopyrrolate, ipratropium, and tiotropium
Ipratropium [i-pra-TROE-pee-um] and tiotropium [TYE-oh-TROE-pee-um] are quaternary derivatives of atropine,
and glycopyrrolate [glye-koe-PYE-roe-late] and aclidinium [a-kli-DIN-ee-um] are synthetic quaternary compounds.
Ipratropium is classified as a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA), while glycopyrrolate, tiotropium, and
aclidinium are classified as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) based on the duration of action. These
agents are approved as bronchodilators for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ipratropium and tiotropium are also used in the acute management of
bronchospasm in asthma and chronic management of asthma, respectively (see Chapter 39). All of these agents are
delivered via inhalation. Because of the positive charge, these drugs do not enter the systemic circulation or the
CNS, restricting effects to the pulmonary system.
189
D.  Tropicamide and cyclopentolate
These agents are used as ophthalmic solutions for mydriasis and cycloplegia. Their duration of action is shorter than
that of atropine. Tropicamide produces mydriasis for 6 hours and cyclopentolate for 24 hours.
190
E.  Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl
Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl are useful as adjuncts with other antiparkinson agents to treat Parkinson disease
(see Chapter 8) and other types of parkinsonian syndromes, including antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal
symptoms.
191
F.  Oxybutynin and other antimuscarinic agents for overactive
bladder
Oxybutynin [ox-i-BYOO-ti-nin], darifenacin [dar-e-FEN-a-sin], fesoterodine [fes-oh-TER-oh-deen], solifenacin
[sol-ee-FEN-a-sin], tolterodine [tol-TER-oh-deen], and trospium [TROSE-pee-um] are synthetic atropine-like drugs
with antimuscarinic actions.
1.  Actions
By competitively blocking muscarinic (M3) receptors in the bladder, intravesical pressure is lowered, bladder
capacity is increased, and the frequency of bladder contractions is reduced. Antimuscarinic actions at M3 receptors
in the GI tract, salivary glands, CNS, and eye may cause adverse effects. Darifenacin and solifenacin are relatively
more selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonists; however, the other drugs are mainly nonselective muscarinic
antagonists, and binding to other muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to adverse effects.
2.  Therapeutic uses
These agents are used for management of overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. Oxybutynin is also used in
patients with neurogenic bladder.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
All of the agents are available in oral dosage forms. Most agents have a long half-life, which allows once-daily
administration. [Note: Immediate-release oxybutynin and tolterodine must be dosed two or more times daily;
however, extended-release formulations of these agents allow for once-daily dosing.] Oxybutynin is also available in
a transdermal patch and topical gel formulation. These drugs are hepatically metabolized by the cytochrome P450
system (primarily CYP 3A4 and 2D6), with the exception of trospium, which is thought to undergo ester hydrolysis.
4.  Adverse effects
Side effects include dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision, which limit tolerability of these agents. Extended-
release formulations and the transdermal patch have a lower incidence of adverse effects and may be better tolerated.
Trospium is a quaternary compound that minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier and has fewer CNS effects than
do other agents, making it a preferred choice in treating overactive bladder in patients with dementia. Important
characteristics of the muscarinic antagonists are summarized in Figures 5.6 and 5.7.
192

glaucoma. GI = gastrointestinal; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

195
III.  Ganglionic Blockers
Ganglionic blockers specifically act on the nicotinic receptors of both parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic
ganglia. Some also block the ion channels of the autonomic ganglia. These drugs show no selectivity toward the
parasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia and are not effective as neuromuscular antagonists. Thus, these drugs block
the entire output of the autonomic nervous system at the nicotinic receptor. Except for nicotine, the other drugs
mentioned in this category are nondepolarizing, competitive antagonists. The responses of the nondepolarizing
blockers are complex and mostly unpredictable. Therefore, ganglionic blockade is rarely used therapeutically, but
often serves as a tool in experimental pharmacology.
196
A.  Nicotine
A component of cigarette smoke, nicotine [NIK-oh-teen] is a poison with many undesirable actions. It is without
therapeutic benefit and is deleterious to health. Depending on the dose, nicotine depolarizes autonomic ganglia,
resulting first in stimulation and then in paralysis of all ganglia. The stimulatory effects are complex and result from
increased release of neurotransmitters (Figure 5.8), due to effects on both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia
(see Chapter 15 for a full discussion of nicotine).
197
Figure 5.8 Neurochemical effects of nicotine. GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.
198
199
IV.  Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
These drugs block cholinergic transmission between motor nerve endings and the nicotinic receptors on skeletal
muscle (Figure 5.2). They possess some chemical similarities to ACh and act either as antagonists (nondepolarizing)
or as agonists (depolarizing) at the receptors on the endplate of the NMJ. Neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) are
clinically useful to facilitate rapid intubation when needed due to respiratory failure (rapid sequence intubation).
During surgery, they are used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide complete muscle relaxation at lower
anesthetic doses. This increases the safety of anesthesia by allowing patients to recover quickly and completely.
NMBs should not substitute for inadequate anesthesia. NMBs are also used in the intensive care unit (ICU) as
adjuvant therapy to facilitate intubation and mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.
200
A.  Nondepolarizing (competitive) blockers
The first known NMB was curare [kyoo-RAH-ree], which Amazon hunters used to paralyze prey. The development
of tubocurarine [too-boe-kyoo-AR-een] followed, but it has been replaced by agents with fewer adverse effects,
such as cisatracurium [cis-a-trah-CURE-ih-um], mivacurium [mi-vah-KYOO-ree-um], pancuronium [pan-kure-OH-
nee-um], rocuronium [roe-kyoor-OH-nee-um], and vecuronium [ve-KYOO-roe-nee-um].
1.  Mechanism of action
a.  At low doses
NMBs competitively block ACh at the nicotinic receptors (Figure 5.9). They compete with ACh at the receptor
without stimulating it, thus preventing depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and inhibiting muscular
contraction. Their competitive action can be overcome by administration of cholinesterase inhibitors, such as
neostigmine and edrophonium, which increase the concentration of ACh in the NMJ. Clinicians employ this strategy
to shorten the duration of neuromuscular blockade. In addition, at low doses the muscle responds to direct electrical
stimulation from a peripheral nerve stimulator to varying degrees, allowing for monitoring of the extent of
neuromuscular blockade.
Figure 5.9 Mechanism of action of competitive neuromuscular blocking drugs.
b.  At high doses
Nondepolarizing agents can block the ion channels of the motor end plate. This leads to further weakening of
neuromuscular transmission, reducing the ability of cholinesterase inhibitors to reverse the actions of the
nondepolarizing blockers. With complete blockade, the muscle does not respond to direct electrical stimulation.
2.  Actions
Muscles have differing sensitivity to blockade by competitive agents. Small, rapidly contracting muscles of the face
and eye are most susceptible and are paralyzed first, followed by the fingers, limbs, neck, and trunk muscles. Next,
the intercostal muscles are affected and, lastly, the diaphragm. The muscles recover in the reverse manner. [Note:
Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent that terminates the action of both rocuronium and vecuronium and
can be used to speed recovery (see Chapter 13).]
3.  Pharmacokinetics
All NMBs are injected intravenously or occasionally intramuscularly. These agents possess two or more quaternary
amines in their bulky ring structure that prevent absorption from the gut. They penetrate membranes very poorly and
do not enter cells or cross the blood–brain barrier. Drug action is terminated in a variety of ways (Figure 5.10).
Pancuronium is excreted unchanged in urine. Cisatracurium undergoes organ-independent metabolism (via
Hofmann elimination) to laudanosine, which is further metabolized and renally excreted. The amino steroid drugs
vecuronium and rocuronium are deacetylated in the liver and excreted unchanged in bile. Mivacurium is eliminated
by plasma cholinesterase. The choice of agent depends on the desired onset and duration of muscle relaxation and
the route of elimination. Characteristics of the neuromuscular-blocking drugs are shown in Figure 5.11.
201

undergoes organ-independent elimination. Mivacurium and succinylcholine are
metabolized by plasma cholinesterase. IV = intravenous.
202
203
Figure 5.11 Characteristics of neuromuscular blocking drugs.
4.  Adverse effects
In general, these agents are safe with minimal side effects. The adverse effects of the specific NMBs are shown in
Figure 5.11.
5.  Drug interactions
a.  Cholinesterase inhibitors
Drugs such as neostigmine, physostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium can overcome the action of
nondepolarizing NMBs. However, with increased dosage, cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a depolarizing block
due to elevated ACh concentrations at the end plate membrane. If the NMB has entered the ion channel (is bound to
the receptor), cholinesterase inhibitors are not as effective in overcoming blockade.
b.  Halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics
Drugs such as desflurane act to enhance neuromuscular blockade by exerting a stabilizing action at the NMJ. These
agents sensitize the NMJ to the effects of NMBs.
c.  Aminoglycoside antibiotics
Drugs such as gentamicin and tobramycin inhibit ACh release from cholinergic nerves by competing with calcium
ions. They synergize with competitive blockers, enhancing neuromuscular blockade.
d.  Calcium channel blockers
These agents may increase the neuromuscular blockade of competitive blockers.
204
B.  Depolarizing agents
Depolarizing blocking agents work by depolarizing the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, similar to the action
of ACh. However, these agents are more resistant to degradation by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and can more
persistently depolarize the muscle fibers. Succinylcholine [suk-sin-il-KOE-leen] is the only depolarizing muscle
relaxant in use today.
1.  Mechanism of action
Succinylcholine attaches to the nicotinic receptor and acts like ACh to depolarize the junction (Figure 5.12). Unlike
ACh, which is instantly destroyed by AChE, the depolarizing agent persists at high concentrations in the synaptic
cleft, remaining attached to the receptor for a longer time and providing sustained depolarization of the muscle cell.
[Note: The duration of action is dependent on diffusion from the motor end plate and hydrolysis by plasma
cholinesterase (also called butyrylcholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase). Genetic variants in which plasma
cholinesterase levels are low or absent lead to prolonged neuromuscular paralysis.] The depolarizing agent first
causes opening of the sodium channel associated with nicotinic receptors, which results in depolarization of the
receptor (phase I). This leads to a transient twitching of the muscle (fasciculations). Continued binding of the
depolarizing agent renders the receptor incapable of transmitting further impulses. With time, continuous
depolarization gives way to gradual repolarization as the sodium channel closes or is blocked. This causes a
resistance to depolarization (phase II) and flaccid paralysis.
205
Figure 5.12 Mechanism of action of depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.
206
2.  Actions
As with the competitive blockers, the respiratory muscles are paralyzed last. Succinylcholine initially produces brief
muscle fasciculations that cause muscle soreness. This may be prevented by administering a small dose of
nondepolarizing NMB prior to succinylcholine. Normally, the duration of action of succinylcholine is extremely
short, due to rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase. However, succinylcholine that reaches the NMJ is not
metabolized, allowing the agent to bind to nicotinic receptors, and redistribution to plasma is necessary for
metabolism.
3.  Therapeutic uses
Because of its rapid onset of action, succinylcholine is useful when rapid endotracheal intubation is required. It is
also used during electroconvulsive shock treatment.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Succinylcholine is injected intravenously. Its brief duration of action results from redistribution and rapid hydrolysis
by plasma cholinesterase. Drug effects rapidly disappear upon discontinuation.
5.  Adverse effects
a.  Hyperthermia
Succinylcholine can potentially induce malignant hyperthermia in susceptible patients (see Chapter 13).
b.  Apnea
Administration of succinylcholine to a patient who is deficient in plasma cholinesterase or has an atypical form of
the enzyme can lead to prolonged apnea due to paralysis of the diaphragm. The rapid release of potassium may also
contribute to prolonged apnea in patients with electrolyte imbalances. In patients with electrolyte imbalances
receiving digoxin or diuretics (such as heart failure patients) succinylcholine should be used cautiously or not at all.
c.  Hyperkalemia
Succinylcholine increases potassium release from intracellular stores. This may be particularly dangerous in burn
patients and patients with massive tissue damage in which potassium has been rapidly lost or in patients with renal
failure.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
During an ophthalmic surgical procedure, the surgeon wanted to constrict the pupil using a miotic drug.
However, he accidentally used another drug that caused dilation of the pupil (mydriasis). Which drug was
most likely used?
A.  Acetylcholine
B.  Pilocarpine
C.  Tropicamide
D.  Bethanechol
Correct answer = C. Muscarinic agonists such as ACh, pilocarpine, and bethanechol contract the circular muscles
of iris sphincter and cause constriction of the pupil (miosis), whereas muscarinic antagonists such as tropicamide
prevent contraction of the circular muscles of the iris and cause dilation of the pupil (mydriasis).
Sarin is a nerve gas that is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. Which agent could be used as an
antidote to sarin poisoning?
A.  Pilocarpine
B.  Carbachol
C.  Atropine
D.  Physostigmine
Correct answer = C. Sarin is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. It causes an increase in ACh levels in
tissues that leads to cholinergic crisis through activation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Most symptoms of
cholinergic crisis are mediated by muscarinic receptors and, therefore, the muscarinic antagonist atropine is used
as an antidote for sarin poisoning. Cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine, carbachol, and physostigmine
(indirect agonists) worsen symptoms of sarin poisoning.
A patient with Alzheimer disease needs treatment for overactive bladder (OAB). Which drug is the best
choice for this patient?
A.  Darifenacin
B.  Solifenacin
C.  Tolterodine
D.  Trospium
Correct answer = D. All of agents for OAB except trospium cross the blood–brain barrier to various degrees and
could worsen dementia symptoms in Alzheimer disease. Trospium is a quaternary ammonium compound that
minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier.
A patient with asthma was prescribed a β2 agonist for acute relief of bronchospasm, but did not respond to
treatment. Which drug is the most likely next option for this patient?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Ipratropium
C.  Oxybutynin
D.  Physostigmine
Correct answer = B. Major receptors present in the bronchial tissues are muscarinic and adrenergic β2 receptors.
Muscarinic activation causes bronchoconstriction, and β2 receptor activation causes bronchodilation. Therefore,
direct or indirect (physostigmine) muscarinic agonists worsen bronchospasm. Ipratropium is a muscarinic
antagonist that can relax bronchial smooth muscles and relieve bronchospasm in patients who are not responsive
to β2 agonists. Benztropine is used in the treatment of Parkinson disease or relief of extrapyramidal symptoms
from antipsychotics. Oxybutynin is used for overactive bladder.
A 50-year-old male who is noncompliant with medications was recently diagnosed with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). His physician would like to prescribe an inhaled anticholinergic that is dosed
once or twice daily. Which drug is most appropriate for this patient?
A.  Atropine
B.  Ipratropium
C.  Tiotropium
D.  Trospium
Correct answer = C. The physician should prescribe a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) so that the
patient has to inhale the medication only 1 or 2 times daily. Tiotropium is a LAMA, whereas ipratropium is a
short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA). Atropine and trospium are muscarinic antagonists, but are not
indicated for pulmonary conditions such as asthma or COPD and are not available as inhaled formulations.

Which is the most effective drug for motion sickness for a person planning to go on a cruise?
A.  Atropine
B.  Fesoterodine
C.  Scopolamine
D.  Tropicamide
Correct answer = C. All muscarinic antagonists (anticholinergic drugs) listed are theoretically useful as
antimotion sickness drugs; however, scopolamine is the most effective in preventing motion sickness.
Tropicamide mostly has ophthalmic uses, and fesoterodine is used for overactive bladder.
Which is correct regarding ganglion-blocking drugs?
A.  Blockade of sympathetic ganglia could result in reduced blood pressure.
B.  Blockade of parasympathetic ganglia could result in reduced heart rate.
C.  Nicotine is a nondepolarizing ganglion blocker.
D.  Atropine is a nondepolarizing ganglion blocker.
Correct answer = A. Selective blockade (in theory) of the sympathetic ganglion causes reduction in
norepinephrine release and, therefore, reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Selective blockade (in theory) of
the parasympathetic ganglion causes reduction in ACh release and an increase in heart rate. Receptors at both
sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are of the nicotinic type. Nicotine is an agonist at nicotinic receptors
and produces a depolarizing block in the ganglia. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and has no effect on the
nicotinic receptors found in the ganglia.
Which drug is useful in treating sinus bradycardia?
A.  Atropine
B.  Cisatracurium
C.  Neostigmine
D.  Succinylcholine
Correct answer = A. Sinus bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is below normal and most often caused
by increased vagal tone (increased release of ACh in the sinoatrial [SA] node that acts on muscarinic receptors to
reduce heart rate). A muscarinic antagonist such as atropine is useful in this situation to bring the heart rate back
to normal. Succinylcholine and cisatracurium are nicotinic antagonists and have no effect on muscarinic receptors
in the SA node. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and can worsen bradycardia by increasing the level of
ACh in the SA node.
An ICU patient with severe lung injury requires a neuromuscular blocking agent to assist in his ventilator
management. He has liver disease and is currently in renal failure. Which neuromuscular blocker is the best
choice for this patient?
A.  Cisatracurium
B.  Pancuronium
C.  Vecuronium
D.  Rocuronium
Correct answer = A. Pancuronium is renally eliminated and the patient has renal failure. Vecuronium and
rocuronium are hepatically metabolized and the patient has liver disease. Cisatracurium is cleared by organ-
independent metabolism (Hofmann elimination).
Where would you expect to see the first return of function in skeletal muscles following discontinuation of a
nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent?
A.  Arms
B.  Diaphragm
C.  Fingers
D.  Pupils
Correct answer = B. Following administration of a neuromuscular blocker, the facial muscles are impacted first,
but the pupils are not controlled by skeletal muscle and are not affected. The fingers and arms would be next, with
the diaphragm function lost last. Function returns in the opposite order, so function of the diaphragm returns first.

Adrenergic Agonists

I.  Overview
The adrenergic drugs affect receptors that are stimulated by norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine
(adrenaline). These receptors are known as adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors. Drugs that activate adrenergic
receptors are termed sympathomimetics, and drugs that block activation of adrenergic receptors are termed
sympatholytics. Some sympathomimetics directly activate adrenergic receptors (direct-acting agonists), while others
act indirectly by enhancing release or blocking reuptake of norepinephrine (indirect-acting agonists). This chapter
describes agents that either directly or indirectly stimulate adrenoceptors (Figure 6.1). Sympatholytic drugs are
discussed in Chapter 7.
Figure 6.1 Summary of adrenergic agonists. Agents marked with an asterisk (*) are
211
catecholamines.
212
II.  The Adrenergic Neuron
Adrenergic neurons release norepinephrine as the primary neurotransmitter. These neurons are found in the central
nervous system (CNS) and in the sympathetic nervous system, where they serve as links between ganglia and the
effector organs. Adrenergic drugs act on adrenergic receptors, located either presynaptically on the neuron or
postsynaptically on the effector organ (Figure 6.2).
Figure 6.2 Sites of actions of adrenergic agonists.
213
A.  Neurotransmission at adrenergic neurons
Neurotransmission in adrenergic neurons closely resembles that described for the cholinergic neurons (see Chapter
4), except that norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter instead of acetylcholine. Neurotransmission involves the
following steps: synthesis, storage, release, and receptor binding of norepinephrine, followed by removal of the
neurotransmitter from the synaptic gap (Figure 6.3).
Figure 6.3 Synthesis and release of norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron. DOPA =
dihydroxyphenylalanine; MAO = monoamine oxidase; NE = norepinephrine; SNRI =
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
1.  Synthesis of norepinephrine
Tyrosine is transported by a carrier into the adrenergic neuron, where it is hydroxylated to dihydroxyphenylalanine
(DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase. This is the rate-limiting step in the formation of norepinephrine. DOPA is then
decarboxylated by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase to form dopamine in the presynaptic neuron.
2.  Storage of norepinephrine in vesicles
Dopamine is then transported into synaptic vesicles by an amine transporter system. This carrier system is blocked
by reserpine (see Chapter 7). Next, dopamine is hydroxylated to form norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-
hydroxylase.
3.  Release of norepinephrine
An action potential arriving at the nerve junction triggers an influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into
the cytoplasm of the neuron. The increase in calcium causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane and to
undergo exocytosis and expel their contents into the synapse. Drugs such as guanethidine block this release.
4.  Binding to receptors
Norepinephrine released from the synaptic vesicles diffuses into the synaptic space and binds to postsynaptic
214
receptors on the effector organ or to presynaptic receptors on the nerve ending. Binding of norepinephrine to
receptors triggers a cascade of events within the cell, resulting in the formation of intracellular second messengers
that act as links (transducers) in the communication between the neurotransmitter and the action generated within the
effector cell. Adrenergic receptors use both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system
and the phosphatidylinositol cycle to transduce the signal into an effect. Norepinephrine also binds to presynaptic
receptors (mainly α2 subtype) that modulate the release of the neurotransmitter.
5.  Removal of norepinephrine
Norepinephrine may 1) diffuse out of the synaptic space and enter the systemic circulation, 2) be metabolized to
inactive metabolites by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in the synaptic space, or 3) undergo reuptake back
into the neuron. The reuptake by the neuronal membrane involves a sodium–chloride (Na+/Cl−)–dependent
norepinephrine transporter that can be inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine; by
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine; or by cocaine. Reuptake of norepinephrine into the
presynaptic neuron is the primary mechanism for termination of its effects.
6.  Potential fates of recaptured norepinephrine
Once norepinephrine reenters the adrenergic neuron, it may be taken up into synaptic vesicles via the amine
transporter system and be sequestered for release by another action potential, or it may persist in a protected pool in
the cytoplasm. Alternatively, norepinephrine can be oxidized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) present in neuronal
mitochondria.
215
B.  Adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors)
In the sympathetic nervous system, several classes of adrenoceptors can be distinguished pharmacologically. Two
main families of receptors, designated α and β, are classified based on response to the adrenergic agonists
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol. Both the α and β receptor types have a number of specific receptor
subtypes. Alterations in the primary structure of the receptors influence their affinity for various agents.
1.  α-Adrenoceptors
The α-adrenoceptors show a weak response to the synthetic agonist isoproterenol, but they are responsive to the
naturally occurring catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 6.4). For α receptors, the rank order of
potency and affinity is epinephrine ≥ norepinephrine >> isoproterenol. The α-adrenoceptors are divided into two
subtypes, α1 and α2, based on their affinities for α agonists and antagonists. For example, α1 receptors have a higher
affinity for phenylephrine than α2 receptors. Conversely, the drug clonidine selectively binds to α2 receptors and has
less effect on α1 receptors.
216
Figure 6.4 Types of adrenergic receptors.
a.  α1 Receptors
These receptors are present on the postsynaptic membrane of the effector organs and mediate many of the classic
effects, originally designated as α-adrenergic, involving constriction of smooth muscle. Activation of α1 receptors
initiates a series of reactions through the G-protein activation of phospholipase C, ultimately resulting in the
generation of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 initiates the
release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, and DAG turns on other proteins within the cell
(Figure 6.5).
217
Figure 6.5 Second messengers mediate the effects of α receptors. DAG = diacylglycerol;
IP3 = inositol trisphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine
monophosphate.
b.  α2 Receptors
These receptors are located primarily on sympathetic presynaptic nerve endings and control the release of
norepinephrine. When a sympathetic adrenergic nerve is stimulated, a portion of the released norepinephrine “circles
back” and reacts with α2 receptors on the presynaptic membrane (Figure 6.5). Stimulation of α2 receptors causes
feedback inhibition and inhibits further release of norepinephrine from the stimulated adrenergic neuron. This
inhibitory action serves as a local mechanism for modulating norepinephrine output when there is high sympathetic
218
activity. [Note: In this instance, by inhibiting further output of norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron, these
receptors are acting as inhibitory autoreceptors.] α2 Receptors are also found on presynaptic parasympathetic
neurons. Norepinephrine released from a presynaptic sympathetic neuron can diffuse to and interact with these
receptors, inhibiting acetylcholine release. [Note: In these instances, these receptors are behaving as inhibitory
heteroreceptors.] This is another mechanism to modulate autonomic activity in a given area. In contrast to α1
receptors, the effects of binding at α2 receptors are mediated by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and by a fall in the
levels of intracellular cAMP.
c.  Further subdivisions
The α1 and α2 receptors are further divided into α1A, α1B, α1C, and α1D and into α2A, α2B, and α2C. This extended
classification is necessary for understanding the selectivity of some drugs. For example, tamsulosin is a selective α1A
antagonist that is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. The drug has fewer cardiovascular side effects because it
targets α1A subtype receptors found primarily in the urinary tract and prostate gland and does not affect the α1B
subtype found in the blood vessels.
2.  β-Adrenoceptors
Responses of β receptors differ from those of α receptors and are characterized by a strong response to
isoproterenol, with less sensitivity to epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 6.4). For β receptors, the rank order of
potency is isoproterenol > epinephrine > norepinephrine. The β-adrenoceptors can be subdivided into three major
subgroups, β1, β2, and β3, based on their affinities for adrenergic agonists and antagonists. β1 receptors have
approximately equal affinities for epinephrine and norepinephrine, whereas β2 receptors have a higher affinity for
epinephrine than for norepinephrine. Thus, tissues with a predominance of β2 receptors (such as the vasculature of
skeletal muscle) are particularly responsive to the effects of circulating epinephrine released by the adrenal medulla.
Binding of a neurotransmitter at any of the three types of β receptors results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and
increased concentrations of cAMP within the cell.
3.  Distribution of receptors
Adrenergically innervated organs and tissues usually have a predominant type of receptor. For example, tissues such
as the vasculature of skeletal muscle have both α1 and β2 receptors, but the β2 receptors predominate. Other tissues
may have one type of receptor almost exclusively. For example, the heart contains predominantly β1 receptors.
4.  Characteristic responses mediated by adrenoceptors
It is useful to organize the physiologic responses to adrenergic stimulation according to receptor type, because many
drugs preferentially stimulate or block one type of receptor. Figure 6.6 summarizes the most prominent effects
mediated by the adrenoceptors. As a generalization, stimulation of α1 receptors characteristically produces
vasoconstriction (particularly in skin and abdominal viscera) and an increase in total peripheral resistance and blood
pressure. Stimulation of β1 receptors characteristically causes cardiac stimulation (increase in heart rate and
contractility), whereas stimulation of β2 receptors produces vasodilation (in skeletal muscle vascular beds) and
smooth muscle relaxation. β3 Receptors are involved in lipolysis (along with β1), and also have effects on the
detrusor muscle of the bladder.
Figure 6.6 Major effects mediated by α- and β-adrenoceptors.
5.  Desensitization of receptors
Prolonged exposure to the catecholamines reduces the responsiveness of these receptors, a phenomenon known as
desensitization. Three mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomenon: 1) sequestration of the
receptors so that they are unavailable for interaction with the ligand; 2) down-regulation, that is, a disappearance of
the receptors either by destruction or by decreased synthesis; and 3) an inability to couple to G-protein, because the
receptor has been phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic side.
219
220
III.  Characteristics of Adrenergic Agonists
Most adrenergic drugs are derivatives of β-phenylethylamine (Figure 6.7). Substitutions on the benzene ring or on
the ethylamine side chains produce a variety of compounds with varying abilities to differentiate between α and β
receptors and to penetrate the CNS. Two important structural features of these drugs are 1) the number and location
of OH substitutions on the benzene ring and 2) the nature of the substituent on the amino nitrogen.
221
222
Figure 6.7 Structures of several important adrenergic agonists. Drugs containing the
catechol ring are shown in yellow.
223
A.  Catecholamines
Sympathomimetic amines that contain the 3,4-dihydroxybenzene group (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,
isoproterenol, and dopamine) are called catecholamines. These compounds share the following properties:
1.  High potency
Catecholamines show the highest potency in directly activating α or β receptors.
2.  Rapid inactivation
Catecholamines are metabolized by COMT postsynaptically and by MAO intraneuronally, by COMT and MAO in
the gut wall, and by MAO in the liver. Thus, catecholamines have only a brief period of action when given
parenterally, and they are inactivated (ineffective) when administered orally.
3.  Poor penetration into the CNS
Catecholamines are polar and, therefore, do not readily penetrate into the CNS. Nevertheless, most catecholamines
have some clinical effects (anxiety, tremor, and headaches) that are attributable to action on the CNS.
224
B.  Noncatecholamines
Compounds lacking the catechol hydroxyl groups have longer half-lives, because they are not inactivated by COMT.
These include phenylephrine, ephedrine, and amphetamine (Figure 6.7). These agents are poor substrates for MAO
(an important route of metabolism) and, thus, show a prolonged duration of action. Increased lipid solubility of
many of the noncatecholamines (due to lack of polar hydroxyl groups) permits greater access to the CNS.
225
C.  Substitutions on the amine nitrogen
The nature of the substituent on the amine nitrogen is important in determining β selectivity of the adrenergic
agonist. For example, epinephrine, with a –CH3 substituent on the amine nitrogen, is more potent at β receptors than
norepinephrine, which has an unsubstituted amine. Similarly, isoproterenol, which has an isopropyl substituent –
CH(CH3)2 on the amine nitrogen (Figure 6.7), is a strong β agonist with little α activity (Figure 6.4).
226
D.  Mechanism of action of adrenergic agonists
1.  Direct-acting agonists
These drugs act directly on α or β receptors, producing effects similar to those that occur following stimulation of
sympathetic nerves or release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla (Figure 6.8). Examples of direct-acting
agonists include epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, dopamine, and phenylephrine.
Figure 6.8 Sites of action of direct-, indirect-, and mixed-acting adrenergic agonists.
2.  Indirect-acting agonists
These agents may block the reuptake of norepinephrine or cause the release of norepinephrine from the cytoplasmic
pools or vesicles of the adrenergic neuron (Figure 6.8). The norepinephrine then traverses the synapse and binds to α
or β receptors. Examples of reuptake inhibitors and agents that cause norepinephrine release include cocaine and
227
amphetamine, respectively.
3.  Mixed-action agonists
Ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine, both stimulate adrenoceptors directly and enhance release of
norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron (Figure 6.8).
228
IV.  Direct-Acting Adrenergic Agonists
Direct-acting agonists bind to adrenergic receptors on effector organs without interacting with the presynaptic
neuron. As a group, these agents are widely used in clinical practice.
229
A.  Epinephrine
Epinephrine [ep-i-NEF-rin] is one of the four catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and
dobutamine) commonly used in therapy. The first three are naturally occurring neurotransmitters, and the latter is a
synthetic compound. In the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine is methylated to yield epinephrine, which is stored in
chromaffin cells along with norepinephrine. On stimulation, the adrenal medulla releases about 80% epinephrine
and 20% norepinephrine directly into the circulation. Epinephrine interacts with both α and β receptors. At low
doses, β effects (vasodilation) on the vascular system predominate, whereas at high doses, α effects
(vasoconstriction) are the strongest.
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
The major actions of epinephrine are on the cardiovascular system. Epinephrine strengthens the contractility of the
myocardium (positive inotrope: β1 action) and increases its rate of contraction (positive chronotrope: β1 action).
Therefore, cardiac output increases. These effects increase oxygen demands on the myocardium. Epinephrine
activates β1 receptors on the kidney to cause renin release. Renin is an enzyme involved in the production of
angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Epinephrine constricts arterioles in the skin, mucous membranes, and
viscera (α effects), and it dilates vessels going to the liver and skeletal muscle (β2 effects). These combined effects
result in a decrease in renal blood flow. Therefore, the cumulative effect is an increase in systolic blood pressure,
coupled with a slight decrease in diastolic pressure due to β2 receptor–mediated vasodilation in the skeletal muscle
vascular bed (Figure 6.9).
230
Figure 6.9 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of low doses of epinephrine.
b.  Respiratory
Epinephrine causes powerful bronchodilation by acting directly on bronchial smooth muscle (β2 action). It also
inhibits the release of allergy mediators such as histamine from mast cells.
231
c.  Hyperglycemia
Epinephrine has a significant hyperglycemic effect because of increased glycogenolysis in the liver (β2 effect),
increased release of glucagon (β2 effect), and a decreased release of insulin (α2 effect).
d.  Lipolysis
Epinephrine initiates lipolysis through agonist activity on the β receptors of adipose tissue. Increased levels of
cAMP stimulate a hormone-sensitive lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol.
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Bronchospasm
Epinephrine is the primary drug used in the emergency treatment of respiratory conditions when
bronchoconstriction has resulted in diminished respiratory function. Thus, in treatment of anaphylactic shock,
epinephrine is the drug of choice and can be lifesaving in this setting. Within a few minutes after subcutaneous
administration, respiratory function greatly improves.
a.  Anaphylactic shock
Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of type I hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) in
response to allergens.
a.  Cardiac arrest
Epinephrine may be used to restore cardiac rhythm in patients with cardiac arrest.
d.  Local anesthesia
Local anesthetic solutions may contain low concentrations (for example, 1:100,000 parts) of epinephrine.
Epinephrine greatly increases the duration of local anesthesia by producing vasoconstriction at the site of injection.
Epinephrine also reduces systemic absorption of the local anesthetic and promotes local hemostasis.
e.  Intraocular surgery
Epinephrine is used in the induction and maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Epinephrine has a rapid onset but a brief duration of action (due to rapid degradation). The preferred route for
anaphylaxis in the outpatient setting is intramuscular (anterior thigh) due to rapid absorption. In emergencies,
epinephrine is given intravenously (IV) for the most rapid onset of action. It may also be given subcutaneously, by
endotracheal tube, or by inhalation (Figure 6.10). It is rapidly metabolized by MAO and COMT, and the metabolites
metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid are excreted in urine.
Figure 6.10 Pharmacokinetics of epinephrine. CNS = central nervous system.
232
4.  Adverse effects
Epinephrine can produce adverse CNS effects that include anxiety, fear, tension, headache, and tremor. It can trigger
cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if the patient is receiving digoxin. Epinephrine can also induce pulmonary edema
due to increased afterload caused by vasoconstrictive properties of the drug. Patients with hyperthyroidism may
have an increased production of adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, leading to an enhanced response to
epinephrine, and the dose must be reduced in these individuals. Inhalation anesthetics also sensitize the heart to the
effects of epinephrine, which may lead to tachycardia. Epinephrine increases the release of endogenous stores of
glucose. In diabetic patients, dosages of insulin may have to be increased. Nonselective β-blockers prevent
vasodilatory effects of epinephrine on β2 receptors, leaving α receptor stimulation unopposed. This may lead to
increased peripheral resistance and increased blood pressure.
233
B.  Norepinephrine
Because norepinephrine [nor-ep-ih-NEF-rin] is the neurotransmitter in the adrenergic neurons, it should,
theoretically, stimulate all types of adrenergic receptors. However, when administered in therapeutic doses, the α-
adrenergic receptor is most affected.
1.  Cardiovascular actions
a.  Vasoconstriction
Norepinephrine causes a rise in peripheral resistance due to intense vasoconstriction of most vascular beds,
including the kidney (α1 effect). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase (Figure 6.11). [Note:
Norepinephrine causes greater vasoconstriction than epinephrine, because it does not induce compensatory
vasodilation via β2 receptors on blood vessels supplying skeletal muscles. The weak β2 activity of norepinephrine
also explains why it is not useful in the treatment of bronchospasm or anaphylaxis.]
234
235
Figure 6.11 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of norepinephrine.
b.  Baroreceptor reflex
Norepinephrine increases blood pressure, and this stimulates the baroreceptors, inducing a rise in vagal activity. The
increased vagal activity produces a reflex bradycardia, which is sufficient to counteract the local actions of
norepinephrine on the heart, although the reflex compensation does not affect the positive inotropic effects of the
drug (Figure 6.11). When atropine, which blocks the transmission of vagal effects, is given before norepinephrine,
stimulation of the heart by norepinephrine is evident as tachycardia.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Norepinephrine is used to treat shock (for example, septic shock), because it increases vascular resistance and,
therefore, increases blood pressure. It has no other clinically significant uses.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Norepinephrine is given IV for rapid onset of action. The duration of action is 1 to 2 minutes, following the end of
the infusion. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO and COMT, and inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine.
4.  Adverse effects
These are similar to epinephrine. In addition, norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and may cause blanching
and sloughing of skin along an injected vein. If extravasation (leakage of drug from the vessel into tissues
surrounding the injection site) occurs, it can cause tissue necrosis. It should not be administered in peripheral veins,
if possible. Impaired circulation from norepinephrine may be treated with the α receptor antagonist phentolamine.
Alternatives to phentolamine include intradermal terbutaline and topical nitroglycerin.
236
C.  Isoproterenol
Isoproterenol [eye-soe-proe-TER-e-nole] is a direct-acting synthetic catecholamine that stimulates both β1- and β2-
adrenergic receptors. Its nonselectivity is a disadvantage and the reason why it is rarely used therapeutically. Its
action on α receptors is insignificant. Isoproterenol produces intense stimulation of the heart (β1 effect), increasing
heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output (Figure 6.12). It is as active as epinephrine in this action. Isoproterenol
also dilates the arterioles of skeletal muscle (β2 effect), resulting in decreased peripheral resistance. Because of its
cardiac stimulatory action, it may increase systolic blood pressure slightly, but it greatly reduces mean arterial and
diastolic blood pressures (Figure 6.12). Isoproterenol is also a potent bronchodilator (β2 effect). The adverse effects
of isoproterenol are similar to the β receptor–related side effects of epinephrine.
237
238
Figure 6.12 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of isoproterenol.
239
D.  Dopamine
Dopamine [DOE-pa-meen], the immediate metabolic precursor of norepinephrine, occurs naturally in the CNS in
the basal ganglia, where it functions as a neurotransmitter, as well as in the adrenal medulla. Dopamine can activate
α- and β-adrenergic receptors. For example, at higher doses, it causes vasoconstriction by activating α1 receptors,
whereas at lower doses, it stimulates β1 cardiac receptors. In addition, D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors, distinct
from the α- and β-adrenergic receptors, occur in the peripheral mesenteric and renal vascular beds, where binding of
dopamine produces vasodilation. D2 receptors are also found on presynaptic adrenergic neurons, where their
activation interferes with norepinephrine release.
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
Dopamine exerts a stimulatory effect on the β1 receptors of the heart, having both positive inotropic and
chronotropic effects (Figure 6.13). At very high doses, dopamine activates α1 receptors on the vasculature, resulting
in vasoconstriction.
240
241
Figure 6.13 Clinically important actions of isoproterenol and dopamine.
b.  Renal and visceral
Dopamine dilates renal and splanchnic arterioles by activating dopaminergic receptors, thereby increasing blood
flow to the kidneys and other viscera (Figure 6.13). These receptors are not affected by α- or β-blocking drugs, and
in the past, low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine was often used in the prevention or treatment of acute renal failure.
However, more recent data suggest there is limited clinical utility in the renal protective effects of dopamine.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Dopamine can be used for cardiogenic and septic shock and is given by continuous infusion. It raises blood pressure
by stimulating the β1 receptors on the heart to increase cardiac output, and α1 receptors on blood vessels to increase
total peripheral resistance. It enhances perfusion to the kidney and splanchnic areas, as described above. Increased
blood flow to the kidney enhances the glomerular filtration rate and causes diuresis. By contrast, norepinephrine can
diminish blood supply to the kidney and may reduce renal function. Dopamine is also used to treat hypotension,
severe heart failure, and bradycardia unresponsive to other treatments.
3.  Adverse effects
An overdose of dopamine produces the same effects as sympathetic stimulation. Dopamine is rapidly metabolized
by MAO or COMT, and its adverse effects (nausea, hypertension, and arrhythmias) are, therefore, short lived.
242
E.  Fenoldopam
Fenoldopam [fen-OL-de-pam] is an agonist of peripheral dopamine D1 receptors. It is used as a rapid-acting
vasodilator to treat severe hypertension in hospitalized patients, acting on coronary arteries, kidney arterioles, and
mesenteric arteries. Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture, and the R-isomer is the active component. It undergoes
extensive first-pass metabolism and has a 10-minute elimination half-life after IV infusion. Headache, flushing,
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia (due to vasodilation) may occur with this agent.
243
F.  Dobutamine
Dobutamine [doe-BYOO-ta-meen] is a synthetic, direct-acting catecholamine that is primarily a β1 receptor agonist
with minor β2 and α1 effects. It increases heart rate and cardiac output with few vascular effects. Dobutamine is used
to increase cardiac output in acute heart failure (see Chapter 18), as well as for inotropic support after cardiac
surgery. The drug increases cardiac output and does not elevate oxygen demands of the myocardium as much as
other sympathomimetic drugs. Dobutamine should be used with caution in atrial fibrillation, because it increases
atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Other adverse effects are similar to epinephrine. Tolerance may develop with
prolonged use.
244
G.  Oxymetazoline
Oxymetazoline [OX-ee-mee-TAZ-ih-leen] is a direct-acting synthetic adrenergic agonist that stimulates both α1- and
α2-adrenergic receptors. Oxymetazoline is found in many over-the-counter nasal spray decongestants, as well as in
ophthalmic drops for the relief of redness of the eyes associated with swimming, colds, and contact lenses.
Oxymetazoline directly stimulates α receptors on blood vessels supplying the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva, thereby
producing vasoconstriction and decreasing congestion. It is absorbed in the systemic circulation regardless of the
route of administration and may produce nervousness, headaches, and trouble sleeping. Local irritation and sneezing
may occur with intranasal administration. Use for greater than 3 days is not recommended, as rebound congestion
and dependence may occur.
245
H.  Phenylephrine
Phenylephrine [fen-ill-EF-reen] is a direct-acting, synthetic adrenergic drug that binds primarily to α1 receptors.
Phenylephrine is a vasoconstrictor that raises both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. It has no effect on the heart
itself but, rather, induces reflex bradycardia when given parenterally, making it useful in the treatment of
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The drug is used to treat hypotension in hospitalized or surgical patients
(especially those with a rapid heart rate). Large doses can cause hypertensive headache and cardiac irregularities.
Phenylephrine acts as a nasal decongestant when applied topically or taken orally. Although data suggest it may not
be as effective, phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many oral decongestants, since pseudoephedrine has
been misused to make methamphetamine. Phenylephrine is also used in ophthalmic solutions for mydriasis.
246
I.  Midodrine
Midodrine, a prodrug, is metabolized to the pharmacologically active desglymidodrine. It is a selective α1 agonist,
which acts in the periphery to increase arterial and venous tone. Midodrine is indicated for the treatment of
orthostatic hypotension. The drug should be given three times daily, with doses at 3- or 4-hour intervals. To avoid
supine hypertension, doses within 4 hours of bedtime are not recommended.
247
J.  Clonidine
Clonidine [KLOE-ni-deen] is an α2 agonist used for the treatment of hypertension. It can also be used to minimize
symptoms of withdrawal from opiates, tobacco smoking, and benzodiazepines. Both clonidine and the α2 agonist
guanfacine [GWAHN-fa-seen] may be used in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Clonidine
acts centrally on presynaptic α2 receptors to produce inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor centers, decreasing
sympathetic outflow to the periphery. The most common side effects of clonidine are lethargy, sedation,
constipation, and xerostomia. Abrupt discontinuation must be avoided to prevent rebound hypertension. Clonidine
and another α2 agonist methyldopa are discussed with antihypertensives in Chapter 16.
248
K.  Albuterol, metaproterenol, and terbutaline
Albuterol [al-BYOO-ter-ole], metaproterenol [MET-a-proe-TER-e-nol], and terbutaline [ter-BYOO-te-leen] are
short-acting β2 agonists (SABAs) used primarily as bronchodilators and administered by a metered-dose inhaler
(Figure 6.14). Albuterol is the SABA of choice for the management of acute asthma symptoms, because it is more
selective for β2 receptors than metaproterenol. Inhaled terbutaline is no longer available in the United States, but is
still used in other countries. Injectable terbutaline is used off-label as a uterine relaxant to suppress premature labor,
and use for this indication should not exceed 72 hours. One of the most common side effects of these agents is
tremor, but patients tend to develop tolerance to this effect. Other side effects include restlessness, apprehension,
and anxiety. When these drugs are administered orally, they may cause tachycardia or arrhythmia (due to β1 receptor
activation), especially in patients with underlying cardiac disease. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) also
increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects, and concomitant use should be avoided.

L.  Salmeterol, formoterol, and indacaterol
Salmeterol [sal-ME-ter-ole], formoterol [for-MOH-ter-ole], arformoterol (the [R,R]-enantiomer of formoterol), and
indacaterol [IN-da-KA-ter-ol] are long-acting β2 selective agonists (LABAs) used for the management of
respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see Chapter 39). A single dose by a
metered-dose inhalation device, such as a dry powder inhaler, provides sustained bronchodilation over 12 hours,
compared with less than 3 hours for albuterol. Unlike formoterol, however, salmeterol has a somewhat delayed
onset of action (Figure 6.14). LABAs are not recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of asthma, because
they have been shown to increase the risk of asthma-related deaths; however, these agents are highly efficacious
when combined with an asthma controller medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid.
252
M.  Mirabegron
Mirabegron [mir-a-BEG-ron] is a β3 agonist that relaxes the detrusor smooth muscle and increases bladder capacity.
It is used for patients with overactive bladder. Mirabegron may increase blood pressure and should not be used in
patients with uncontrolled hypertension. It increases levels of digoxin and inhibits the CYP2D6 isozyme, which may
enhance the effects of other medications metabolized by this pathway (for example, metoprolol).
253
V.  Indirect-Acting Adrenergic Agonists
Indirect-acting adrenergic agonists cause the release, inhibit the reuptake, or inhibit the degradation of epinephrine
or norepinephrine (Figure 6.8). They potentiate the effects of epinephrine or norepinephrine produced endogenously,
but do not directly affect postsynaptic receptors.
254
A.  Amphetamine
The marked central stimulatory action of amphetamine [am-FET-a-meen] is often mistaken by drug abusers as its
only action. However, the drug can also increase blood pressure significantly by α1 agonist action on the
vasculature, as well as β1 stimulatory effects on the heart. Its actions are mediated primarily through an increase in
nonvesicular release of catecholamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine from nerve terminals. Thus,
amphetamine is an indirect-acting adrenergic drug. The actions and therapeutic uses of amphetamine and its
derivatives are discussed with CNS stimulants (see Chapter 15).
255
B.  Tyramine
Tyramine [TIE-ra-meen] is not a clinically useful drug, but it is important because it is found in fermented foods,
such as aged cheese and Chianti wine. It is a normal by-product of tyrosine metabolism. Normally, it is oxidized by
MAO in the gastrointestinal tract, but if the patient is taking MAOIs, it can precipitate serious vasopressor episodes.
Like amphetamines, tyramine can enter the nerve terminal and displace stored norepinephrine. The released
catecholamine then acts on adrenoceptors.
256
C.  Cocaine
Cocaine [koe-KANE] is unique among local anesthetics in having the ability to block the sodium–chloride (Na+/Cl
−)–dependent norepinephrine transporter required for cellular uptake of norepinephrine into the adrenergic neuron.
Consequently, norepinephrine accumulates in the synaptic space, resulting in enhanced sympathetic activity and
potentiation of the actions of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Therefore, small doses of the catecholamines produce
greatly magnified effects in an individual taking cocaine. In addition, the duration of action of epinephrine and
norepinephrine is increased. Like amphetamines, it can increase blood pressure by α1 agonist actions and β
stimulatory effects. Cocaine as a drug of abuse is discussed in Chapter 45.
257
VI.  Mixed-Action Adrenergic Agonists
Ephedrine [eh-FED-rin] and pseudoephedrine [soo-doe-eh-FED-rin] are mixed-action adrenergic agents. They not
only enhance release of stored norepinephrine from nerve endings (Figure 6.8) but also directly stimulate both α and
β receptors. Thus, a wide variety of adrenergic actions ensue that are similar to those of epinephrine, although less
potent. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are not catecholamines and are poor substrates for COMT and MAO.
Therefore, these drugs have a long duration of action. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have excellent absorption
after oral administration and penetrate the CNS, but pseudoephedrine has fewer CNS effects. Ephedrine is
eliminated largely unchanged in urine, and pseudoephedrine undergoes incomplete hepatic metabolism before
elimination in urine. Ephedrine raises systolic and diastolic blood pressures by vasoconstriction and cardiac
stimulation and it is indicated in anesthesia-induced hypotension. Ephedrine produces bronchodilation, but it is less
potent and slower acting than epinephrine or isoproterenol. It was previously used to prevent asthma attacks but has
been replaced by more effective medications. Ephedrine produces a mild stimulation of the CNS. This increases
alertness, decreases fatigue, and prevents sleep. It also improves athletic performance. [Note: The clinical use of
ephedrine is declining because of the availability of better, more potent agents that cause fewer adverse effects.
Ephedrine-containing herbal supplements (mainly ephedra-containing products) have been banned by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration because of life-threatening cardiovascular reactions.] Oral pseudoephedrine is primarily
used to treat nasal and sinus congestion. Pseudoephedrine has been illegally used to produce methamphetamine.
Therefore, products containing pseudoephedrine have certain restrictions and must be kept behind the sales counter
in the United States. Important characteristics of the adrenergic agonists are summarized in Figures 6.15 to 6.17.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the following is correct regarding adrenergic neurotransmission?
A.  Norepinephrine is the major neurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve terminals.
B.  Norepinephrine is mainly released from the adrenal glands.
C.  Tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine prevent the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminals.
D.  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) converts dopamine to norepinephrine in the nerve terminal.
Correct answer = A. Norepinephrine (NE) is the major neurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve
terminals. Epinephrine, not norepinephrine, is mainly released from the adrenal glands. Tricyclic antidepressants
(TCAs) and cocaine inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine into the sympathetic nerve terminals, but they do not
prevent the release of NE. Dopamine is converted to norepinephrine by dopamine β-hydroxylase, not by MAO.
Which of the following adrenergic drugs is used in the treatment of overactive bladder?
A.  Epinephrine
B.  Dobutamine
C.  Phenylephrine
D.  Mirabegron
Correct answer = D. Detrusor muscles in the urinary bladder wall have β3 receptors. Stimulation of these
receptors relaxes the urinary bladder wall and relieves overactive bladder. Mirabegron is a β3 agonist and
therefore used in treating overactive bladder. None of the other drugs listed have β3 agonist activity.
Which of the following classes of adrenergic agents has utility in the management of hypertension?
A.  α1 Agonist
B.  α2 Agonist
C.  β1 Agonist
D.  β3 Agonist
Correct answer = B. α2 Agonists activate α2 receptors located in the presynaptic terminal of sympathetic neurons
and cause a reduction in the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals. This leads to a reduction
in blood pressure. α2 Agonists such as clonidine and methyldopa are therefore used as antihypertensive agents. α1
Agonists cause vasoconstriction, and β1 agonists cause increased cardiac output and renin release, so these agents
may increase blood pressure. β3 Agonists are not used in the management of hypertension.
Which of the following is correct regarding responses mediated by adrenergic receptors?
A.  Stimulation of α1 receptors increases blood pressure.
B.  Stimulation of sympathetic presynaptic α2 receptors increases norepinephrine release.
C.  Stimulation of β2 receptors increases heart rate (tachycardia).
D.  Stimulation of β2 receptors causes bronchoconstriction.
Correct answer = A. Stimulation of α1 receptors, mostly found in the blood vessels, causes vasoconstriction and
an increase in blood pressure. Stimulation of α2 receptors on the sympathetic presynaptic terminal reduces the
release of norepinephrine. β2 receptors are not found in the heart, so activation of β2 receptors does not affect
heart rate. Stimulation of β2 receptors found in the bronchial tissues causes bronchodilation, not
bronchoconstriction.
An asthma patient was given a nonselective β agonist to relieve bronchoconstriction. Which adverse effect
would you expect in this patient?
A.  Bradycardia
B.  Tachycardia
C.  Hypotension (reduction in blood pressure)
D.  Worsening bronchoconstriction
Correct answer = B. A nonselective β agonist activates both β1 and β2 receptors. β1 Activation causes an increase
in heart rate (tachycardia), contractility, and subsequent increase in blood pressure. It relieves bronchoconstriction
because of the β2 receptor activation.
A 22-year-old male is brought to the emergency room with suspected cocaine overdose. Which of the
following symptoms is most likely in this patient?
A.  Hypertension
B.  Bronchoconstriction
262
6.7
6.8
6.9
6.10
C.  Bradycardia
D.  Miosis (constriction of pupil)
Correct answer = A. Cocaine is an indirect adrenergic agonist that prevents the reuptake of norepinephrine into
the nerve terminals, thus increasing the levels of NE in the synaptic cleft. The increase in NE leads to an increase
in blood pressure (hypertension), tachycardia (not bradycardia), mydriasis (not miosis), and other symptoms of
sympathetic overactivity.
A 12-year-old boy with a peanut allergy is brought to the emergency room after accidental consumption of
peanuts. He is in anaphylactic shock. Which of the following drugs is most appropriate to treat this patient?
A.  Norepinephrine
B.  Phenylephrine
C.  Dobutamine
D.  Epinephrine
Correct answer = D. Norepinephrine has more α agonistic effects and activates mainly α1, α2, and β1 receptors.
Epinephrine has more β agonistic effects and activates mainly α1, α2, β1, and β2 receptors. Phenylephrine has
predominantly α effects and activates mainly α1 receptors. Dobutamine mainly activates β1 receptors and has no
significant effects on β2 receptors. Thus, epinephrine is the drug of choice in anaphylactic shock that can both
stimulate the heart (β1 activation) and dilate bronchioles (β2 activation).
An elderly patient is brought to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 76/60 mm Hg, tachycardia, and
low cardiac output. He is diagnosed with acute heart failure. Which of the following drugs is most
appropriate to improve his cardiac function?
A.  Epinephrine
B.  Fenoldopam
C.  Dobutamine
D.  Isoproterenol
Correct answer = C. Among the choices, the ideal drug to increase contractility in acute heart failure is
dobutamine, since it is a selective β1-adrenergic agonist. Fenoldopam is a dopamine agonist used to treat severe
hypertension. The other drugs are nonselective adrenergic agonists that could cause unwanted side effects.
Which of the following adrenergic agonists is commonly present in nasal sprays available over-the-counter
(OTC) to treat nasal congestion?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Albuterol
C.  Oxymetazoline
D.  Formoterol
Correct answer = C. Drugs with selective α1 agonistic activity are commonly used as nasal decongestants because
of their ability to cause vasoconstriction in the nasal vessels. Oxymetazoline is an α1 agonist and therefore the
preferred drug among the choices as a nasal decongestant. Clonidine is an α2 agonist, albuterol is a β2 agonist, and
formoterol is a long-acting β2 agonist.
A patient who has hypertension and mild asthma attacks bought a herbal remedy for asthma online. He does
not take any prescription medications for asthma, but takes a β1-selective blocker for hypertension. The
herbal remedy relieves the asthma attacks, but his blood pressure seems to increase despite the β-blocker
therapy. Which of the following drugs is most likely present in the herbal remedy?
A.  Phenylephrine
B.  Norepinephrine
C.  Ephedrine
D.  Salmeterol
Correct answer = C. Both ephedrine and salmeterol can relieve asthma symptoms, as they activate β2 receptors in
the bronchioles and cause bronchodilation. However, salmeterol is a selective β2 agonist and should not increase
blood pressure. By contrast, ephedrine stimulates the release of norepinephrine and acts as a direct agonist at α-
and β-adrenergic receptors, thus causing an increase in blood pressure. Phenylephrine (a nonselective α agonist)
does not cause bronchodilation, so it would not relieve asthma symptoms. Norepinephrine is a nonselective
adrenergic agonist that does not have any stimulatory effects on β2 receptors. In addition, norepinephrine is not
active when given orally.

Adrenergic Antagonists
Rajan Radhakrishnan and Sandhya Jinesh
265
I.  Overview
The adrenergic antagonists (also called adrenergic blockers or sympatholytics) bind to adrenoceptors but do not
trigger the usual receptor-mediated intracellular effects. These drugs act by either reversibly or irreversibly attaching
to the adrenoceptors, thus preventing activation by endogenous or exogenous agonists. Like the agonists, the
adrenergic antagonists are classified according to their relative affinities for α or β receptors in the sympathetic
nervous system. Numerous adrenergic antagonists have important roles in clinical medicine, primarily to treat
diseases associated with the cardiovascular system. [Note: Antagonists that block dopamine receptors are most
important in the central nervous system (CNS) and are, therefore, considered in that section.] The adrenergic
antagonists discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure 7.1.
266
Figure 7.1 Summary of blocking agents and drugs affecting neurotransmitter uptake or
release.
267
268
II.  α-Adrenergic Blocking Agents
α-Adrenergic blocking agents antagonize the subtype(s) of α-adrenergic receptors (α1 or α2), depending on the
specificity of the agent for the receptor subtype(s). Drugs that block α1-adrenoceptors profoundly affect blood
pressure. Because normal sympathetic control of the vasculature occurs in large part through agonist actions on α1-
adrenergic receptors, blockade of these receptors reduces the sympathetic tone of the blood vessels, resulting in
decreased peripheral vascular resistance. This lowered blood pressure induces reflex tachycardia. The magnitude of
the response depends on the sympathetic tone of the individual when the agent is given. Selective α2-adrenergic
blockers have limited clinical utility.
269
A.  Phenoxybenzamine
Phenoxybenzamine [fen-ox-ee-BEN-za-meen] is a nonselective, noncompetitive blocker of α1- and α2-adrenergic
receptors.
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular effects
The drug prevents α1 receptor vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels caused by endogenous catecholamines,
which leads to decreased peripheral resistance and resultant reflex tachycardia. However, by blocking presynaptic α2
receptors on the sympathetic nerve terminals in the heart, phenoxybenzamine causes an increase in the release of
norepinephrine, which in turn increases heart rate and cardiac output (mediated by β1 receptors). This may also lead
to cardiac arrhythmias and anginal pain. Thus, the drug has been unsuccessful in maintaining lowered blood
pressure in hypertension, and it is no longer used for this purpose.
b.  Epinephrine reversal
All α-adrenergic blockers reverse the α agonist actions of epinephrine. For example, the vasoconstrictive action of
epinephrine is interrupted, but vasodilation of other vascular beds caused by stimulation of β2 receptors is not
blocked. Therefore, in the presence of phenoxybenzamine, the systemic blood pressure decreases in response to
epinephrine (Figure 7.2). [Note: The actions of norepinephrine are not reversed but are diminished because
norepinephrine lacks significant β agonist action on the vasculature.] Phenoxybenzamine has no effect on the actions
of isoproterenol, which is a pure β agonist (Figure 7.2).
Figure 7.2 Summary of effects of adrenergic blockers on the changes in blood pressure
induced by isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.
270
2.  Therapeutic uses
Phenoxybenzamine is used in the treatment of sweating and hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma, a
catecholamine-secreting tumor of cells derived from the adrenal medulla. Phenoxybenzamine is sometimes effective
in treating Raynaud disease and frostbite.
3.  Adverse effects
Phenoxybenzamine can cause postural hypotension, nasal stuffiness, nausea, and vomiting. It may inhibit
ejaculation. It may also induce reflex tachycardia, which is mediated by the baroreceptor reflex. Phenoxybenzamine
should be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.
271
B.  Phentolamine
In contrast to phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine [fen-TOLE-a-meen] produces a competitive block of α1 and α2
receptors. Effects last for approximately 4 hours after a single injection. Pharmacological effects of phentolamine
are very similar to those of phenoxybenzamine. It is used for the diagnosis and short-term management of
pheochromocytoma. It is also used locally to prevent dermal necrosis following extravasation of norepinephrine.
Phentolamine is useful to treat hypertensive crisis due to abrupt withdrawal of clonidine or ingestion of tyramine-
containing foods in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
272
C.  Prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin
Prazosin [PRAY-zoe-sin], terazosin [ter-AY-zoe-sin], and doxazosin [dox-AY-zoe-sin] are selective competitive
blockers of the α1 receptor. In contrast to phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, they are useful in the treatment of
hypertension. [Note: Tamsulosin [tam-SUE-loh-sin], alfuzosin [al-FYOO-zoe-sin], and silodosin [sye-LOE-doe-sin]
are examples of other selective α1 antagonists indicated for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see
Chapter 41).] Metabolism leads to inactive products that are excreted in urine except for those of doxazosin, which
appear in feces. Doxazosin is the longest acting of these drugs.
1.  Mechanism of action
These agents decrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower blood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial
and venous smooth muscle. Unlike phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, these drugs cause minimal changes in
cardiac output, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate. Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin have less
pronounced effects on blood pressure because they are less selective for α1B receptors found in the blood vessels and
more selective for α1A receptors in the prostate and bladder. Blockade of the α1A receptors decreases tone in the
smooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate and improves urine flow.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Individuals with elevated blood pressure treated with one of these drugs do not become tolerant to its action.
However, the first dose of these drugs may produce an exaggerated orthostatic hypotensive response (Figure 7.3)
that can result in syncope (fainting). This action, termed a “first-dose” effect, may be minimized by adjusting the
first dose to one-third or one-fourth of the normal dose and by giving the drug at bedtime. These drugs may cause
modest improvement in lipid profiles and glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients. Because of inferior
cardiovascular outcomes as compared to other antihypertensives, α1 antagonists are not used as monotherapy for the
treatment of hypertension (see Chapter 16).
Figure 7.3 First dose of α1 receptor blocker may produce an orthostatic hypotensive
response that can result in syncope (fainting).
3.  Adverse effects
α1-Blockers such as prazosin and doxazosin may cause dizziness, a lack of energy, nasal congestion, headache,
drowsiness, and orthostatic hypotension (although to a lesser degree than that observed with phenoxybenzamine and
phentolamine). An additive antihypertensive effect occurs when α1 antagonists are given with vasodilators such as
nitrates or PDE-5 inhibitors (for example, sildenafil), thereby necessitating cautious dose titration and use at the
lowest possible doses. These agents may cause “floppy iris syndrome,” a condition in which the iris billows in
response to intraoperative eye surgery. Figure 7.4 summarizes some adverse effects observed with α-blockers.
273
Figure 7.4 Some adverse effects commonly observed with α-adrenergic blocking agents.
274
D.  Yohimbine
Yohimbine [yo-HIM-bean] is a selective competitive α2-blocker that works at the level of the CNS to increase
sympathetic outflow to the periphery. It is found as a component of the bark of the yohimbe tree (Pausinystalia
yohimbe) and has been used as a sexual stimulant and in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Its use in the
treatment of these disorders is not recommended due to lack of demonstrated efficacy.
275
III.  β-Adrenergic Blocking Agents
All of the clinically available β-blockers are competitive antagonists. Nonselective β-blockers act at both β1 and β2
receptors, whereas cardioselective β antagonists primarily block β1 receptors. [Note: There are no clinically useful
β2 selective antagonists.] These drugs also differ in intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), CNS effects, blockade
of sympathetic receptors, vasodilation, and pharmacokinetics (Figure 7.5). Although all β-blockers lower blood
pressure, they do not induce postural hypotension, because the α-adrenoceptors remain functional. Therefore, normal
sympathetic control of the vasculature is maintained. β-Blockers are effective in treating systemic as well as portal
hypertension, angina, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, and glaucoma.
They are also used for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. [Note: The names of all β-blockers end in “-olol”
except for labetalol and carvedilol.]
Figure 7.5 Elimination half-lives for some β-blockers.
276
A.  Propranolol: a nonselective β antagonist
Propranolol [proe-PRAN-oh-lole] is the prototype β-adrenergic antagonist and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors with
equal affinity. Sustained-release preparations for once-a-day dosing are available. Nonselective β-blockers,
including propranolol, have the ability to block the actions of isoproterenol (β1, β2 agonist) on the cardiovascular
system. Thus, in the presence of a β-blocker, isoproterenol does not produce cardiac stimulation (β1 mediated) or
reductions in mean arterial pressure and diastolic pressure (β2 mediated; Figure 7.2). [Note: In the presence of a
nonselective β-blocker, epinephrine no longer lowers diastolic blood pressure or stimulates the heart, but its
vasoconstrictive action (mediated by α receptors) remains unimpaired. The actions of norepinephrine on the
cardiovascular system are mediated primarily by α receptors and are, therefore, mostly unaffected.]
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
Propranolol diminishes cardiac output, having both negative inotropic and chronotropic effects (Figure 7.6). It
directly depresses sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal activity. The resulting bradycardia usually limits the dose of
the drug. During exercise or stress, when the sympathetic nervous system is activated, β-blockers attenuate the
expected increase in heart rate. Cardiac output, workload, and oxygen consumption are decreased by blockade of β1
receptors, and these effects are useful in the treatment of angina (see Chapter 20). The β-blockers are effective in
attenuating supraventricular cardiac arrhythmias, but generally are not effective against ventricular arrhythmias
(except those induced by exercise).
277
278
Figure 7.6 Actions of propranolol and other β-blockers.
b.  Peripheral vasoconstriction
Nonselective blockade of β receptors prevents β2-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscles, increasing peripheral
vascular resistance (Figure 7.6). The reduction in cardiac output produced by all β-blockers leads to decreased blood
pressure, which triggers a reflex peripheral vasoconstriction that is reflected in reduced blood flow to the periphery.
In patients with hypertension, total peripheral resistance returns to normal or decreases with long-term use of
propranolol as a result of down regulation of the β receptors. There is a gradual reduction of both systolic and
diastolic blood pressures in hypertensive patients.
c.  Bronchoconstriction
Blocking β2 receptors in the lungs of susceptible patients causes contraction of the bronchiolar smooth muscle
(Figure 7.6). This can precipitate an exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
asthma. Therefore, β-blockers, particularly nonselective ones, are contraindicated in patients with asthma and should
be avoided in COPD.
d.  Disturbances in glucose metabolism
β-Blockade leads to decreased glycogenolysis and decreased glucagon secretion. Therefore, if propranolol is given
to a diabetic patient receiving insulin, careful monitoring of blood glucose is essential, because pronounced
hypoglycemia may occur after insulin injection. β-Blockers also attenuate the normal physiologic response to
hypoglycemia. [Note: Diaphoresis with hypoglycemia still occurs, as this is mediated through the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine.]
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Hypertension
Propranolol does not reduce blood pressure in people with normal blood pressure. Propranolol lowers blood
pressure in hypertension by several different mechanisms of action. Decreased cardiac output is the primary
mechanism, but inhibition of renin release from the kidney, decrease in total peripheral resistance with long-term
use, and decreased sympathetic outflow from the CNS also contribute to the antihypertensive effects (see Chapter
16).
b.  Angina pectoris
Propranolol decreases the oxygen requirement of heart muscle and, therefore, is effective in reducing chest pain on
exertion that is common in angina. Propranolol is therefore useful in the management of chronic stable angina.
c.  Myocardial infarction
Propranolol and other β-blockers have a protective effect on the myocardium. Thus, patients who have had one
myocardial infarction seem to be protected against a second heart attack by prophylactic use of β-blockers. In
addition, administration of a β-blocker immediately following a myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and early
mortality. The mechanism for these effects may be a reduction in the actions of circulating catecholamines that
increase the oxygen demand in an already ischemic heart muscle. Propranolol also reduces the incidence of sudden
arrhythmic death after myocardial infarction.
d.  Migraine
Propranolol is effective in reducing migraine episodes when used prophylactically (see Chapter 37). It is one of the
more useful β-blockers for this indication, due to its lipophilic nature that allows it to penetrate the CNS. [Note: For
the acute management of migraine, serotonin agonists such as sumatriptan are used, as well as other drugs.]
e.  Hyperthyroidism
Propranolol and other β-blockers are effective in blunting the widespread sympathetic stimulation that occurs in
hyperthyroidism. In acute hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm), β-blockers may be lifesaving in protecting against
serious cardiac arrhythmias.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
After oral administration, propranolol is almost completely absorbed. It is subject to first-pass effect, and only about
25% of an administered dose reaches the circulation. The volume of distribution of propranolol is quite large (4
L/kg), and the drug readily crosses the blood–brain barrier due to its high lipophilicity. Propranolol is extensively
metabolized, and most metabolites are excreted in the urine.
4.  Adverse effects
a.  Bronchoconstriction
Propranolol has the potential to cause significant bronchoconstriction due to blockade of β2 receptors (Figure 7.7).
Death by asphyxiation has been reported for patients with asthma who inadvertently received the drug. Therefore,
propranolol is contraindicated in patients with COPD or asthma.
279
Figure 7.7 Adverse effects commonly observed in individuals treated with propranolol.
b.  Arrhythmias
Treatment with β-blockers must never be stopped abruptly because of the risk of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias,
which may be severe. The β-blockers must be tapered off gradually over a period of at least a few weeks. Long-term
treatment with a β antagonist leads to up-regulation of the β receptor. On suspension of therapy, the increased
receptors can precipitate worsened angina or hypertension through action of endogenous catecholamines on the up-
regulated β receptors.
c.  Sexual impairment
Impaired sexual activity has been reported in male patients taking propranolol. The reasons for this are not clear and
may be independent of β receptor blockade. However, β-blockers do not affect ejaculation (mediated by α
receptors).
d.  Metabolic disturbances
280
β-Blockade leads to decreased glycogenolysis and decreased glucagon secretion. Fasting hypoglycemia may occur.
In addition, β-blockers can prevent the counterregulatory effects of catecholamines during hypoglycemia. Thus, the
perception of symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor, tachycardia, and nervousness are blunted by β-blockers. A
major role of β receptors is to mobilize energy molecules such as free fatty acids. [Note: Lipases in fat cells are
activated mainly by β receptor stimulation, leading to the metabolism of triglycerides into free fatty acids.] Patients
administered nonselective β-blockers may have increased triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein (“good”
cholesterol) through β-blockade. These effects on the serum lipid profile may be less pronounced with the use of β1-
selective antagonists such as metoprolol.
e.  CNS effects
Propranolol has numerous CNS-mediated effects, including depression, dizziness, lethargy, fatigue, weakness,
visual disturbances, hallucinations, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, vivid dreams (including nightmares),
and depression. Fewer CNS effects may be seen with more hydrophilic β-blockers (for example, atenolol) because
they do not cross the blood–brain barrier as readily.
f.  Drug interactions
Drugs that interfere with, or inhibit, the metabolism of propranolol, such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and
ritonavir, may potentiate its antihypertensive effects. Conversely, those that stimulate or induce its metabolism, such
as barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampin, can decrease its effects. Nonselective β-blockers such as propranolol may
prevent the rescue effects of epinephrine in anaphylaxis.
281
B.  Nadolol and timolol: nonselective β antagonists
Nadolol [NAH-doh-lole] and timolol [TIM-o-lole] also block β1- and β2-adrenoceptors and are more potent than
propranolol. Nadolol has a very long duration of action (Figure 7.5). Timolol reduces the production of aqueous
humor in the eye. It is used topically in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.
1.  Treatment of glaucoma
β-Blockers, such as topically applied timolol, are effective in diminishing intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Figure
7.8). This occurs by decreasing the secretion of aqueous humor by the ciliary body. Carteolol [kar-TEE-oh-lol],
levobunolol [lee-voe-BYOO-noe-lole], and metipranolol [met-i-PRAN-oh-lol] are nonselective β antagonists,
whereas betaxolol [be-TAKS-oh-lol] is a β1-selective agent. Unlike the cholinergic drugs, these agents neither affect
the ability of the eye to focus for near vision nor change pupil size. When administered intraocularly, the onset is
about 30 minutes, and the effects last for 12 to 24 hours. The β-blockers are only used for chronic management of
glaucoma. In an acute attack of glaucoma, pilocarpine is still the drug of choice for emergency lowering of
intraocular pressure. Other agents used in the treatment of glaucoma are summarized in Figure 7.8.
Figure 7.8 Classes of drugs used to treat glaucoma.
282
C.  Acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol,
and nebivolol: selective β1 antagonists
Drugs that preferentially block the β1 receptors minimize the unwanted bronchoconstriction (β2 effect) seen with use
of nonselective agents in asthma patients. Cardioselective β-blockers, such as acebutolol [a-se-BYOO-toe-lole],
atenolol [a-TEN-oh-lole], and metoprolol [me-TOE-proe-lole], antagonize β1 receptors at doses 50- to 100-fold less
than those required to block β2 receptors. This cardioselectivity is most pronounced at low doses and is lost at high
doses. [Note: Because β1 selectivity of these agents is lost at high doses, they may antagonize β2 receptors.]
1.  Actions
These drugs lower blood pressure in hypertension and increase exercise tolerance in angina (Figure 7.6). Esmolol
[EZ-moe-lole] has a very short half-life (Figure 7.5) due to metabolism of an ester linkage. It is only available
intravenously and is used to control blood pressure or heart rhythm in critically ill patients and those undergoing
surgery or diagnostic procedures. In addition to its cardioselective β-blockade, nebivolol [ne-BIV-oh-lole] releases
nitric oxide from endothelial cells and causes vasodilation. In contrast to propranolol, the cardioselective β-blockers
have fewer effects on pulmonary function, peripheral resistance, and carbohydrate metabolism. Nevertheless, asthma
patients treated with these agents must be carefully monitored to make certain that respiratory activity is not
compromised. Because these drugs have less effect on peripheral vascular β2 receptors, coldness of extremities
(Raynaud phenomenon), a common side effect of β-blockers, is less frequent.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The cardioselective β-blockers are useful in hypertensive patients with impaired pulmonary function. These agents
are also first-line therapy for chronic stable angina. Bisoprolol and the extended-release formulation of metoprolol
are indicated for the management of chronic heart failure.
283
D.  Acebutolol and pindolol: antagonists with partial agonist
activity
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
Acebutolol (β1-selective antagonist) and pindolol (nonselective β-blocker) [PIN-doe-lole] are not pure antagonists.
These drugs can also weakly stimulate both β1 and β2 receptors (Figure 7.9) and are said to have ISA. These partial
agonists stimulate the β receptor to which they are bound, yet they inhibit stimulation by the more potent
endogenous catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The result of these opposing actions is a diminished
effect on reduction of cardiac rate and cardiac output compared to that of β-blockers without ISA.
284
285
Figure 7.9 Comparison of agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists of β-adrenoceptors.
b.  Decreased metabolic effects
β-Blockers with ISA minimize the disturbances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism that are seen with other β-
blockers. For example, these agents do not decrease plasma HDL levels.
2.  Therapeutic use
β-Blockers with ISA are effective in hypertensive patients with moderate bradycardia, because a further decrease in
heart rate is less pronounced with these drugs. [Note: β-blockers with ISA are not used for stable angina or
arrhythmias due to their partial agonist effect.] Overall, β-blockers with ISA are infrequently used in clinical
practice. Figure 7.10 summarizes some of the indications for β-blockers.
286
287

288
E.  Labetalol and carvedilol: antagonists of both α- and β-
adrenoceptors
1.  Actions
Labetalol [lah-BET-a-lole] and carvedilol [CAR-ve-dil-ol] are nonselective β-blockers with concurrent α1-blocking
actions that produce peripheral vasodilation, thereby reducing blood pressure. They contrast with the other β-
blockers that produce initial peripheral vasoconstriction, and these agents are, therefore, useful in treating
hypertensive patients for whom increased peripheral vascular resistance is undesirable. Carvedilol also decreases
lipid peroxidation and vascular wall thickening, effects that have benefit in heart failure.
2.  Therapeutic use in hypertension and heart failure
Labetalol is used as an alternative to methyldopa in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous
labetalol is also used to treat hypertensive emergencies, because it can rapidly lower blood pressure (see Chapter
16). β-Blockers should not be given to patients with an acute exacerbation of heart failure, as they can worsen the
condition. However, carvedilol as well as metoprolol and bisoprolol are beneficial in patients with stable chronic
heart failure. These agents work by blocking the effects of sympathetic stimulation on the heart, which causes
worsening heart failure over time (see Chapter 18).
3.  Adverse effects
Orthostatic hypotension and dizziness are associated with α1-blockade. Figure 7.11 summarizes the receptor
specificities and uses of the β-adrenergic antagonists.
Figure 7.11 Summary of β-adrenergic antagonists. NO = nitric oxide. 1Acebutolol and
pindolol are partial agonists, as well. 2Bisoprolol, metoprolol, and carvedilol are also
used for the treatment of heart failure.
289
IV.  Drugs Affecting Neurotransmitter Release or Uptake
Some agents act on the adrenergic neuron, either to interfere with neurotransmitter release from storage vesicles or
to alter the uptake of the neurotransmitter into the adrenergic neuron. However, due to the advent of newer and more
effective agents with fewer side effects, these agents are seldom used therapeutically. Reserpine [re-SER-peen] is
one of the remaining agents in this category.
Reserpine, a plant alkaloid, blocks the Mg2+/adenosine triphosphate–dependent transport of biogenic amines
(norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) from the cytoplasm into storage vesicles in the adrenergic nerve
terminals in all body tissues. This causes the ultimate depletion of biogenic amines. Sympathetic function, in
general, is impaired because of decreased release of norepinephrine. Reserpine has a slow onset, a long duration of
action, and effects that persist for many days after discontinuation. It has been used for the management of
hypertension but has largely been replaced with newer agents with better side effect profiles and fewer drug
interactions. It is also indicated in agitated psychotic states such as schizophrenia to relieve symptoms.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 60-year-old patient started a new antihypertensive medication. His blood pressure is well controlled, but
he complains of fatigue, drowsiness, and fainting when he gets up from the bed (orthostatic hypotension).
Which of the following drugs is he most likely taking?
A.  Metoprolol
B.  Propranolol
C.  Prazosin
D.  Alfuzosin
Correct answer = C. Because they block α1-mediated vasoconstriction, α-blockers (prazosin) are more likely to
cause orthostatic hypotension, as compared to β-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol). Alfuzosin is a more selective
antagonist for α1A receptors in the prostate and bladder and is less likely to cause hypotension than prazosin.
A 30-year-old male patient was brought to the ER with amphetamine overdose. He presented with high
blood pressure and arrhythmias. Which drug is the most appropriate to treat the cardiovascular symptoms of
amphetamine overdose in this patient?
A.  Metoprolol
B.  Prazosin
C.  Labetalol
D.  Nebivolol
Correct answer = C. Amphetamine is an indirect adrenergic agonist that mainly enhances the release of
norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Therefore, it activates all types of adrenergic receptors (that
is, α and β receptors) and causes an increase in blood pressure. Since both α and β receptors are activated
indirectly by amphetamine, α-blockers (prazosin) or β-blockers (metoprolol, nebivolol) alone cannot relieve the
cardiovascular effects of amphetamine poisoning. Labetalol blocks both α1 and beta receptors and can minimize
the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine overdose.
A new antihypertensive drug was tested in an animal model of hypertension. The drug when given alone
reduces blood pressure in the animal. Norepinephrine when given in the presence of this drug did not cause
any significant change in blood pressure or heart rate in the animal. The mechanism of action of the new
drug is similar to which of the following agents?
A.  Doxazosin
B.  Clonidine
C.  Atenolol
D.  Carvedilol
Correct answer = D. Norepinephrine activates both α1 and β1 receptors and causes an increase in heart rate and
blood pressure. A drug that prevents the increase in blood pressure caused by norepinephrine should be similar to
carvedilol that antagonizes both α1 and β1 receptors. Doxazosin is an α1 antagonist, clonidine is an α2 agonist, and
atenolol is a β antagonist, and these drugs cannot completely prevent the cardiovascular effects of norepinephrine.
A β-blocker was prescribed for hypertension in a patient with asthma. After a week of treatment, the asthma
attacks got worse, and the patient was asked to stop taking the β-blocker. Which β-blocker would you
suggest as an alternative that is less likely to worsen the asthma?
A.  Propranolol
B.  Metoprolol
C.  Labetalol
D.  Carvedilol
Correct answer = B. The patient was most likely given a nonselective β-blocker (antagonizes both β1 and β2
receptors) that made the asthma worse due to β2 antagonism. An alternative is to prescribe a cardioselective
(antagonizes only β1) β-blocker that does not antagonize β2 receptors in the bronchioles. Metoprolol is a
cardioselective β-blocker. Propranolol, labetalol, and carvedilol are nonselective β-blockers and could worsen the
asthma.
A 70-year-old male is treated with doxazosin for overflow incontinence due to his enlarged prostate. He
complains of dizzy spells while getting up from bed at night. Which drug would you suggest as an alternative
that may not cause dizziness?
A.  Propranolol
B.  Phentolamine
C.  Tamsulosin
D.  Terazosin
291
7.6
7.7
7.8
7.9
7.10
Correct answer = C. Dizziness in this elderly patient could be due to orthostatic hypotension caused by doxazosin.
Tamsulosin is an α1 antagonist that is more selective to the α1 receptor subtype (α1A) present in the prostate and
less selective to the α1 receptor subtype (α1B) present in the blood vessels. Therefore, tamsulosin should not affect
blood pressure significantly and may not cause dizziness. Terazosin and phentolamine antagonize both these
subtypes and cause significant hypotension as a side effect. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that is not
indicated in overflow incontinence.
A 50-year-old male was in anaphylactic shock after being stung by a hornet. The medical team tried to
reverse the bronchoconstriction and hypotension using epinephrine; however, the patient did not fully
respond to the treatment. The patient’s wife mentioned that he is taking a prescription medication for blood
pressure. Which medication is he most likely taking that contributed to a reduced response to epinephrine?
A.  Doxazosin
B.  Propranolol
C.  Metoprolol
D.  Acebutolol
Correct answer = B. Epinephrine reverses hypotension by activating β1 receptors and relieves bronchoconstriction
by activating β2 receptors in anaphylaxis. Since epinephrine was not effective in reversing hypotension or
bronchoconstriction in this patient, it could be assumed that the patient was on a nonselective β-blocker
(propranolol). Doxazosin (α1-blocker), metoprolol, or acebutolol (both β1-selective blockers) would not have
completely prevented the effects of epinephrine.
Which of the following is correct regarding α-adrenergic blockers?
A.  α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of hypotension in anaphylactic shock.
B.  α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
C.  α-Adrenergic blockers may cause bradycardia.
D.  α-Adrenergic blockers reduce the frequency of urination.
Correct answer = B. α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of BPH because of their relaxant effect on
prostate smooth muscles. Being antihypertensive agents, they are not useful in treating hypotension in
anaphylaxis. α-Adrenergic blockers generally cause reflex tachycardia (not bradycardia) due to the significant
drop in blood pressure caused by them. They increase (not reduce) the frequency of urination by relaxing the
internal sphincter of the urinary bladder, which is controlled by α1 receptors.
Which of the following is correct regarding β-blockers?
A.  Treatment with β-blockers should not be stopped abruptly.
B.  Propranolol is a cardioselective β-blocker.
C.  Cardioselective β-blockers worsen asthma.
D.  β-Blockers decrease peripheral resistance by causing vasorelaxation.
Correct answer = A. If β-blocker therapy is stopped abruptly, that could cause angina and rebound hypertension.
This could be due to the up-regulation of β receptors in the body. β-Blockers do not cause direct vasorelaxation.
Therefore, they do not decrease peripheral resistance with short-term use. Propranolol is a nonselective β-blocker
(not cardioselective). Cardioselective β-blockers antagonize only β1 receptors and do not worsen asthma, as they
do not antagonize β2 receptors.
Which of the following drugs is commonly used topically in the treatment of glaucoma?
A.  Esmolol
B.  Timolol
C.  Silodosin
D.  Yohimbine
Correct answer = B. β-Blockers reduce the formation of aqueous humor in the eye and therefore reduce
intraocular pressure, thus relieving glaucoma. Timolol is a nonselective β-blocker that is commonly used topically
to treat glaucoma. Esmolol is a short-acting β-blocker that is used intravenously for hypertension or arrhythmias.
Silodosin is an α1 antagonist used for BPH, and yohimbine is a α2 antagonist used for sexual dysfunction.
Which of the following drugs has the highest potential to worsen orthostatic hypotension when given
together with prazosin?
A.  Propranolol
B.  Atenolol
C.  Nebivolol
D.  Labetalol
Correct answer = D. Labetalol is a nonselective β-blocker with α1-blocking activity. Prazosin causes orthostatic
hypotension due to its α1-blockade, which could be enhanced by adding labetalol. Propranolol, atenolol and
292
nebivolol do not have α1-blocking effects.

Drugs Affecting the Central Nervous System

Drugs for Neurodegenerative Diseases
Jose A. Rey
295
I.  Overview
Most drugs that affect the central nervous system (CNS) act by altering some step in the neurotransmission process.
Drugs affecting the CNS may act presynaptically by influencing the production, storage, release, or termination of
action of neurotransmitters. Other agents may activate or block postsynaptic receptors. This chapter provides an
overview of the CNS, with a focus on those neurotransmitters that are involved in the actions of the clinically useful
CNS drugs. These concepts are useful in understanding the etiology and treatment strategies for the
neurodegenerative disorders that respond to drug therapy: Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis
(MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Figure 8.1).
296
Figure 8.1 Summary of agents used in the treatment of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer
disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
297
II.  Neurotransmission in the CNS
The basic functioning of neurons in the CNS is similar to that of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) described in
Chapter 3. For example, transmission of information in both the CNS and in the periphery involves the release of
neurotransmitters that diffuse across the synaptic cleft to bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. In
both systems, the recognition of the neurotransmitter by the membrane receptor of the postsynaptic neuron triggers
intracellular changes. However, several major differences exist between neurons in the peripheral ANS and those in
the CNS. The circuitry of the CNS is more complex than that of the ANS, and the number of synapses in the CNS is
far greater. The CNS, unlike the peripheral ANS, contains networks of inhibitory neurons that are constantly active
in modulating the rate of neuronal transmission. In addition, the CNS communicates through the use of multiple
neurotransmitters, whereas the ANS uses only two primary neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.
298
III.  Synaptic Potentials
In the CNS, receptors in most synapses are coupled to ion channels. Binding of the neurotransmitter to the
postsynaptic membrane receptors results in a rapid but transient opening of ion channels. Open channels allow
specific ions inside and outside the cell membrane to flow down their concentration gradients. The resulting change
in the ionic composition across the membrane of the neuron alters the postsynaptic potential, producing either
depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, depending on the specific ions and the direction
of their movement.
299
A.  Excitatory pathways
Neurotransmitters can be classified as either excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the nature of the action they
elicit. Stimulation of excitatory neurons causes a movement of ions that results in a depolarization of the
postsynaptic membrane. These excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) are generated by the following: 1)
Stimulation of an excitatory neuron causes the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or acetylcholine,
which bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. This causes a transient increase in the permeability of
sodium (Na+) ions. 2) The influx of Na+ causes a weak depolarization, or EPSP, that moves the postsynaptic
potential toward its firing threshold. 3) If the number of stimulated excitatory neurons increases, more excitatory
neurotransmitter is released. This ultimately causes the EPSP depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to pass a
threshold, thereby generating an all-or-none action potential. [Note: The generation of a nerve impulse typically
reflects the activation of synaptic receptors by thousands of excitatory neurotransmitter molecules released from
many nerve fibers.] Figure 8.2 shows an example of an excitatory pathway.
Figure 8.2 Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, causes
300
depolarization of the neuron.
301
B.  Inhibitory pathways
Stimulation of inhibitory neurons causes movement of ions that results in a hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic
membrane. These inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) are generated by the following: 1) Stimulation of
inhibitory neurons releases neurotransmitters, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine, which bind to
receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. This causes a transient increase in the permeability of specific ions,
such as potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−). 2) The influx of Cl− and efflux of K+ cause a weak hyperpolarization, or
IPSP, that moves the postsynaptic potential away from its firing threshold. This diminishes the generation of action
potentials. Figure 8.3 shows an example of an inhibitory pathway.
302
303
Figure 8.3 Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
causes hyperpolarization of the neuron.
304
C.  Combined effects of the EPSP and IPSP
Most neurons in the CNS receive both EPSP and IPSP input. Thus, several different types of neurotransmitters may
act on the same neuron, but each binds to its own specific receptor. The overall action is the summation of the
individual actions of the various neurotransmitters on the neuron. The neurotransmitters are not uniformly
distributed in the CNS but are localized in specific clusters of neurons, the axons of which may synapse with
specific regions of the brain. Many neuronal tracts, thus, seem to be chemically coded, and this may offer greater
opportunity for selective pharmacological modulation of certain neuronal pathways.
305
IV.  Neurodegenerative Diseases
Neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS include Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, MS, and ALS. These
devastating illnesses are characterized by the progressive loss of selected neurons in discrete brain areas, resulting in
characteristic disorders of movement, cognition, or both.
306
V.  Overview of Parkinson Disease
Parkinsonism is a progressive neurological disorder of muscle movement, characterized by tremors, muscular
rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural and gait abnormalities. Most cases involve people over the age of 65, among
whom the incidence is about 1 in 100 individuals.
307
A.  Etiology
The cause of Parkinson disease is unknown for most patients. The disease is correlated with destruction of
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra with a consequent reduction of dopamine actions in the corpus
striatum, parts of the basal ganglia system that are involved in motor control.
1.  Substantia nigra
The substantia nigra, part of the extrapyramidal system, is the source of dopaminergic neurons (shown in red in
Figure 8.4) that terminate in the neostriatum. Each dopaminergic neuron makes thousands of synaptic contacts
within the neostriatum and therefore modulates the activity of a large number of cells. These dopaminergic
projections from the substantia nigra fire tonically rather than in response to specific muscular movements or
sensory input. Thus, the dopaminergic system appears to serve as a tonic, sustaining influence on motor activity,
rather than participating in specific movements.
Figure 8.4 Role of substantia nigra in Parkinson disease. ACh = acetylcholine; DA =
dopamine; GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.
2.  Neostriatum
Normally, the neostriatum is connected to the substantia nigra by neurons (shown in orange in Figure 8.4) that
secrete the inhibitory transmitter GABA at their termini. In turn, cells of the substantia nigra send neurons back to
the neostriatum, secreting the inhibitory transmitter dopamine at their termini. This mutual inhibitory pathway
normally maintains a degree of inhibition of both areas. In Parkinson disease, destruction of cells in the substantia
nigra results in the degeneration of the nerve terminals that secrete dopamine in the neostriatum. Thus, the normal
inhibitory influence of dopamine on cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum is significantly diminished, resulting in
overproduction, or a relative overactivity, of acetylcholine by the stimulatory neurons (shown in green in Figure
308
8.4). This triggers a chain of abnormal signaling, resulting in loss of the control of muscle movements.
3.  Secondary parkinsonism
Drugs such as the phenothiazines and haloperidol, whose major pharmacologic action is blockade of dopamine
receptors in the brain, may produce parkinsonian symptoms (also called pseudoparkinsonism). These drugs should
be used with caution in patients with Parkinson disease.
309
B.  Strategy of treatment
In addition to an abundance of inhibitory dopaminergic neurons, the neostriatum is also rich in excitatory
cholinergic neurons that oppose the action of dopamine (Figure 8.4). Many of the symptoms of parkinsonism reflect
an imbalance between the excitatory cholinergic neurons and the greatly diminished number of inhibitory
dopaminergic neurons. Therapy is aimed at restoring dopamine in the basal ganglia and antagonizing the excitatory
effect of cholinergic neurons, thus reestablishing the correct dopamine/acetylcholine balance.
310
VI.  Drugs Used in Parkinson Disease
Many currently available drugs aim to maintain CNS dopamine levels, or signaling, as constant as possible. These
agents offer temporary relief from the symptoms of the disorder, but they do not arrest or reverse the neuronal
degeneration caused by the disease.
311
A.  Levodopa and carbidopa
Levodopa [lee-voe-DOE-pa] is a metabolic precursor of dopamine (Figure 8.5). It restores dopaminergic
neurotransmission in the neostriatum by enhancing the synthesis of dopamine in the surviving neurons of the
substantia nigra. In early disease, the number of residual dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (typically
about 20% of normal) is adequate for conversion of levodopa to dopamine. Thus, in new patients, the therapeutic
response to levodopa is consistent, and the patient rarely complains that the drug effects “wear off.” Unfortunately,
with time, the number of neurons decreases, and fewer cells are capable of converting exogenously administered
levodopa to dopamine. Consequently, motor control fluctuation develops. Relief provided by levodopa is only
symptomatic, and it lasts only while the drug is present in the body.
Figure 8.5 Synthesis of dopamine from levodopa in the absence and presence of
carbidopa, an inhibitor of dopamine decarboxylase in the peripheral tissues. (GI =
gastrointestinal.)
1.  Mechanism of action
a.  Levodopa
Dopamine does not cross the blood–brain barrier, but its immediate precursor, levodopa, is actively transported into
the CNS and converted to dopamine (Figure 8.5). Levodopa must be administered with carbidopa [kar-bi-DOE-pa].
Without carbidopa, much of the drug is decarboxylated to dopamine in the periphery, resulting in diminished effect,
nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension.
b.  Carbidopa
Carbidopa, a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor, diminishes the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, thereby
increasing the availability of levodopa to the CNS. The addition of carbidopa lowers the dose of levodopa needed
by four- to five-fold and, consequently, decreases the severity of adverse effects arising from peripherally formed
dopamine.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Levodopa in combination with carbidopa is an efficacious drug regimen for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It
decreases rigidity, tremors, and other symptoms of parkinsonism. In approximately two-thirds of patients with
Parkinson disease, levodopa–carbidopa substantially reduces the severity of symptoms for the first few years of
treatment. Patients typically experience a decline in response during the 3rd to 5th year of therapy. Withdrawal from
the drug must be gradual.
3.  Absorption and metabolism
The drug is absorbed rapidly from the small intestine (when empty of food). Levodopa has an extremely short half-
life (1 to 2 hours), which causes fluctuations in plasma concentration. This may produce fluctuations in motor
response, which generally correlate with the plasma concentration of levodopa, or perhaps give rise to the more
troublesome “on–off” phenomenon, in which the motor fluctuations are not related to plasma levels in a simple way.
Motor fluctuations may cause the patient to suddenly lose normal mobility and experience tremors, cramps, and
immobility. Ingestion of meals, particularly if high in protein, interferes with the transport of levodopa into the CNS.
Thus, levodopa should be taken on an empty stomach, typically 30 minutes before a meal.
4.  Adverse effects
312
a.  Peripheral effects
Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting occur because of stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone (Figure 8.6).
Tachycardia and ventricular extrasystole result from dopaminergic action on the heart. Hypotension may also
develop. Adrenergic action on the iris causes mydriasis. In some individuals, blood dyscrasias and a positive
reaction to the Coombs test are seen. Saliva and urine may turn brownish color because of the melanin pigment
produced from catecholamine oxidation.
313
Figure 8.6 Adverse effects of levodopa.
b.  CNS effects
314
Visual and auditory hallucinations and abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) may occur. These effects are
the opposite of parkinsonian symptoms and reflect overactivity of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Levodopa can also
cause mood changes, depression, psychosis, and anxiety.
5.  Interactions
The vitamin pyridoxine (B6) increases the peripheral breakdown of levodopa and diminishes its effectiveness
(Figure 8.7). Concomitant administration of levodopa and nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),
such as phenelzine, can produce a hypertensive crisis caused by enhanced catecholamine production. Therefore,
concomitant administration of these agents is contraindicated. In many psychotic patients, levodopa exacerbates
symptoms, possibly through the buildup of central catecholamines. Cardiac patients should be carefully monitored
for the possible development of arrhythmias. Antipsychotic drugs are generally contraindicated in Parkinson disease,
because they potently block dopamine receptors and may augment parkinsonian symptoms. However, low doses of
atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine or clozapine, are sometimes used to treat levodopa-induced psychotic
symptoms.
Figure 8.7 Some drug interactions observed with levodopa. MAO = monoamine oxidase.
315
B.  Selegiline, rasagiline, and safinamide
Selegiline [seh-LEDGE-ah-leen], also called deprenyl [DE-pre-nill], selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)
type B, the enzyme that metabolizes dopamine. It does not inhibit MAO type A (metabolizes norepinephrine and
serotonin) unless given above recommended doses, where it loses its selectivity. By decreasing the metabolism of
dopamine, selegiline increases dopamine levels in the brain (Figure 8.8). When selegiline is administered with
levodopa, it enhances the actions of levodopa and substantially reduces the required dose. Unlike nonselective
MAOIs, selegiline at recommended doses has little potential for causing hypertensive crises. However, the drug
loses selectivity at high doses, and there is a risk for severe hypertension. Selegiline is metabolized to
methamphetamine and amphetamine, whose stimulating properties may produce insomnia if the drug is
administered later than mid-afternoon. Rasagiline [ra-SA-gi-leen], an irreversible and selective inhibitor of brain
MAO type B, has five times the potency of selegiline. Unlike selegiline, rasagiline is not metabolized to an
amphetamine-like substance. Safinamide [sa-FIN-a-mide] is also a selective inhibitor of MAO type B indicated for
use as an adjunct to levodopa–carbidopa.
Figure 8.8 Action of selegiline (deprenyl) in dopamine metabolism. (MAO B =
monoamine oxidase type B.)
316
C.  Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors
Normally, the methylation of levodopa by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa is a minor
pathway for levodopa metabolism. However, when peripheral dopamine decarboxylase activity is inhibited by
carbidopa, a significant concentration of 3-O-methyldopa is formed that competes with levodopa for active transport
into the CNS (Figure 8.9). Entacapone [en-TAK-a-pone] and tolcapone [TOLE-ka-pone] selectively and reversibly
inhibit COMT. Inhibition of COMT by these agents leads to decreased plasma concentrations of 3-O-methyldopa,
increased central uptake of levodopa, and greater concentrations of brain dopamine. Both of these agents reduce the
symptoms of “wearing-off” phenomena seen in patients on levodopa–carbidopa. The two drugs differ primarily in
their pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles.
Figure 8.9 Effect of entacapone on dopa concentration in the central nervous system
(CNS). COMT = catechol-O- methyltransferase.
1.  Pharmacokinetics
Oral absorption of both drugs occurs readily and is not influenced by food. They are extensively bound to plasma
albumin, with a limited volume of distribution. Tolcapone has a relatively long duration of action (probably due to
its affinity for the enzyme) compared to entacapone, which requires more frequent dosing. Both drugs are
extensively metabolized and eliminated in feces and urine. The dosage may need to be adjusted in patients with
moderate or severe cirrhosis.
2.  Adverse effects
Both drugs exhibit adverse effects that are observed in patients taking levodopa–carbidopa, including diarrhea,
postural hypotension, nausea, anorexia, dyskinesias, hallucinations, and sleep disorders. Most seriously, fulminating
hepatic necrosis is associated with tolcapone use. Therefore, it should be used, along with appropriate hepatic
function monitoring, only in patients in whom other modalities have failed. Entacapone does not exhibit this toxicity
and has largely replaced tolcapone in clinical practice.
317
D.  Dopamine receptor agonists
This group of antiparkinsonian compounds includes bromocriptine [broe-moe-KRIP-teen], an ergot derivative, and
the nonergot drugs, ropinirole [roe-PIN-i-role], pramipexole [pra-mi-PEX-ole], rotigotine [ro-TIG-oh-teen], and
apomorphine [A-poe-more-feen]. These agents have a longer duration of action than that of levodopa and are
effective in patients exhibiting fluctuations in response to levodopa. Initial therapy with these drugs is associated
with less risk of developing dyskinesias and motor fluctuations as compared to patients started on levodopa.
Bromocriptine, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in patients with Parkinson disease complicated by motor
fluctuations and dyskinesias. However, these drugs are ineffective in patients who have not responded to levodopa.
Apomorphine is an injectable dopamine agonist that is used in severe and advanced stages of the disease to
supplement oral medications. Adverse effects severely limit the utility of the dopamine agonists (Figure 8.10).
318
Figure 8.10 Some adverse effects of dopamine agonists.
1.  Bromocriptine
319
The actions of the ergot derivative bromocriptine are similar to those of levodopa, except that hallucinations,
confusion, delirium, nausea, and orthostatic hypotension are more common, whereas dyskinesia is less prominent. In
psychiatric illness, bromocriptine may cause the mental condition to worsen. It should be used with caution in
patients with a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease due to the risk of vasospasm. Because
bromocriptine is an ergot derivative, it has the potential to cause pulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis.
2.  Apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine
These are nonergot dopamine agonists that are approved for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Ropinirole is also
indicated for the treatment of restless legs syndrome. Pramipexole and ropinirole are orally active agents.
Apomorphine and rotigotine are available in injectable and transdermal delivery systems, respectively. Apomorphine
is used for acute management of the hypomobility “off” phenomenon in advanced Parkinson disease. Rotigotine is
administered as a once-daily transdermal patch that provides even drug levels over 24 hours. These agents alleviate
the motor deficits in patients who have never taken levodopa and also in patients with advanced Parkinson disease
who are treated with levodopa. Dopamine agonists may delay the need to use levodopa in early Parkinson disease
and may decrease the dose of levodopa in advanced Parkinson disease. Unlike the ergotamine derivatives, these
agents do not exacerbate peripheral vascular disorders or cause fibrosis. Nausea, hallucinations, insomnia, dizziness,
constipation, and orthostatic hypotension are adverse effects of these drugs, but dyskinesias are less frequent than
with levodopa (Figure 8.11). Pramipexole is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, and dosage adjustments are
needed in renal dysfunction. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics and other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)
1A2 isoenzyme (for example, fluvoxamine) may inhibit the metabolism of ropinirole, requiring an adjustment in
ropinirole dosage. Figure 8.12 summarizes some properties of dopamine agonists.

321
322
E.  Amantadine
It was accidentally discovered that the antiviral drug amantadine [a-MAN-ta-deen] has an antiparkinsonian action.
Amantadine has several effects on a number of neurotransmitters implicated in parkinsonism, including increasing
the release of dopamine, blocking cholinergic receptors, and inhibiting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of
glutamate receptors. The drug may cause restlessness, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations, and, at high doses, it
may induce acute toxic psychosis. Orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, peripheral edema, and dry mouth also
may occur. Amantadine is less efficacious than levodopa, and tolerance develops more readily. However,
amantadine has fewer adverse effects.
323
F.  Antimuscarinic agents
The antimuscarinic agents are much less efficacious than levodopa and play only an adjuvant role in
antiparkinsonism therapy. The actions of benztropine [BENZ-troe-peen] and trihexyphenidyl [tri-hex-ee-FEN-i-dill]
are similar, although individual patients may respond more favorably to one drug or the other. Blockade of
cholinergic transmission produces effects similar to augmentation of dopaminergic transmission, since it helps to
correct the imbalance in the dopamine/acetylcholine activity (Figure 8.4). These agents can induce mood changes
and confusion, and produce xerostomia, constipation, and visual problems typical of muscarinic blockers (see
Chapter 5). They interfere with gastrointestinal peristalsis and are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma,
prostatic hyperplasia, or pyloric stenosis.
324
VII.  Drugs Used in Alzheimer Disease
Dementia of the Alzheimer type has three distinguishing features: 1) accumulation of senile plaques (β-amyloid
accumulations), 2) formation of numerous neurofibrillary tangles, and 3) loss of cortical neurons, particularly
cholinergic neurons. Current therapies aim to either improve cholinergic transmission within the CNS or prevent
excitotoxic actions resulting from overstimulation of NMDA-glutamate receptors in selected areas of the brain.
Pharmacologic intervention for Alzheimer disease is only palliative and provides modest short-term benefit. None of
the available therapeutic agents alter the underlying neurodegenerative process.
325
A.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
Numerous studies have linked the progressive loss of cholinergic neurons and, presumably, cholinergic transmission
within the cortex to the memory loss that is a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer disease. It is postulated that inhibition
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) within the CNS improves cholinergic transmission, at least at those neurons that are
still functioning. The reversible AChE inhibitors approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease include donepezil
[doe-NE-peh-zil], galantamine [ga-LAN-ta-meen], and rivastigmine [ri-va-STIG-meen]. These agents have some
selectivity for AChE in the CNS, as compared to the periphery. Galantamine may also augment the action of
acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors in the CNS. At best, these compounds may provide a modest reduction in the
rate of loss of cognitive functioning in Alzheimer patients. Rivastigmine is the only agent approved for the
management of dementia associated with Parkinson disease and also the only AChE inhibitor available as a
transdermal formulation. Rivastigmine is hydrolyzed by AChE to a carbamylated metabolite and has no interactions
with drugs that alter the activity of CYP450 enzymes. The other agents are substrates for CYP450 and have a
potential for such interactions. Common adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, tremors,
bradycardia, and muscle cramps (Figure 8.13).
326
327
Figure 8.13 Adverse effects of AChE inhibitors.
328
B.  NMDA receptor antagonist
Stimulation of glutamate receptors in the CNS appears to be critical for the formation of certain memories.
However, overstimulation of glutamate receptors, particularly of the NMDA type, may result in excitotoxic effects
on neurons and is suggested as a mechanism for neurodegenerative or apoptotic (programmed cell death) processes.
Binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor assists in the opening of an ion channel that allows Ca2+ to enter the
neuron. Excess intracellular Ca2+ can activate a number of processes that ultimately damage neurons and lead to
apoptosis. Memantine [meh-MAN-teen] is an NMDA receptor antagonist indicated for moderate to severe
Alzheimer disease. It acts by blocking the NMDA receptor and limiting Ca2+ influx into the neuron, such that toxic
intracellular levels are not achieved. Memantine is well tolerated, with few dose-dependent adverse events. Expected
adverse effects, such as confusion, agitation, and restlessness, are often indistinguishable from the symptoms of
Alzheimer disease. Given its different mechanism of action and possible neuroprotective effects, memantine is often
given in combination with an AChE inhibitor.
329
VIII.  Drugs Used in Multiple Sclerosis
MS is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. The course of MS is variable. For some, MS
may consist of one or two acute neurologic episodes. In others, it is a chronic, relapsing, or progressive disease that
may span 10 to 20 years. Historically, corticosteroids (for example, dexamethasone and prednisone) have been used
to treat acute exacerbations of the disease. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine,
have also been used.
330
A.  Disease-modifying therapies
Drugs currently approved for MS are indicated to decrease relapse rates or, in some cases, to prevent accumulation
of disability. The major target of these medications is to modify the immune response through inhibition of white
blood cell–mediated inflammatory processes that eventually lead to myelin sheath damage and decreased or
inappropriate axonal communication between cells.
1.  Interferon b1a and interferon b1b
The immunomodulatory effects of interferon [in-ter-FEER-on] help to diminish the inflammatory responses that
lead to demyelination of the axon sheaths. Adverse effects of these medications may include depression, local
injection site reactions, increases in hepatic enzymes, and flu-like symptoms.
2.  Glatiramer
Glatiramer [gluh-TEER-a-mur] is a synthetic polypeptide that resembles myelin protein and may act as a decoy to
T-cell attack. Some patients experience a postinjection reaction that includes flushing, chest pain, anxiety, and
itching. It is usually self-limiting.
3.  Fingolimod
Fingolimod [fin-GO-li-mod] is an oral drug that alters lymphocyte migration, resulting in fewer lymphocytes in the
CNS. Fingolimod may cause first-dose bradycardia and is associated with an increased risk of infection and macular
edema.
4.  Teriflunomide
Teriflunomide [te-ree-FLOO-no-mide] is an oral pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that leads to a lower concentration of
active lymphocytes in the CNS. Teriflunomide may cause elevated liver enzymes. It should be avoided in pregnancy.
5.  Dimethyl fumarate
Dimethyl fumarate [dye-METH-il FOO-ma-rate] is an oral agent that may alter the cellular response to oxidative
stress to reduce disease progression. Flushing and abdominal pain are the most common adverse events.
6.  Monoclonal antibodies
Alemtuzumab [AL-em-TOOZ-ue-mab], daclizumab [dah-KLIH-zyoo-mab], natalizumab [na-ta-LIZ-oo-mab], and
ocrelizumab [OK-re-LIZ-ue-mab] are monoclonal antibodies indicated for the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the
first agent to be approved for primary progressive forms of the disease. These agents can be associated with
significant toxicities, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with natalizumab, serious infections with
daclizumab and alemtuzumab, and autoimmune disorders with alemtuzumab. As such, these agents may be reserved
for patients who have failed other therapies.
331
B.  Symptomatic treatment
Many different classes of drugs are used to manage symptoms of MS such as spasticity, constipation, bladder
dysfunction, and depression. Dalfampridine [DAL-fam-pre-deen], an oral potassium channel blocker, improves
walking speeds in patients with MS. It is the first drug approved for this use.
332
IX.  Drugs Used in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in the inability to initiate or control
muscle movement. Riluzole [RIL-ue-zole] and edaravone [e-DAR-a-vone] are indicated for the management of
ALS. Riluzole, an oral NMDA receptor antagonist, is believed to act by inhibiting glutamate release and blocking
sodium channels. Riluzole may improve survival time in patients suffering from ALS. Edaravone is an intravenous
free radical scavenger and antioxidant that may slow the progression of ALS.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 75-year-old man with moderate Parkinson disease is no longer responding to anticholinergic treatment for
his tremors and bradykinesia. Which combination of antiparkinsonian drugs is an appropriate treatment plan?
A.  Amantadine, carbidopa, and entacapone
B.  Levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone
C.  Pramipexole, carbidopa, and entacapone
D.  Ropinirole, carbidopa, and selegiline
Correct answer = B. To reduce the dose of levodopa and its peripheral side effects, the peripheral decarboxylase
inhibitor, carbidopa, is coadministered. As a result of this combination, more levodopa is available for
metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa, which competes with levodopa for the
active transport processes into the CNS. By administering entacapone (an inhibitor of COMT), the competing
product is not formed, and more levodopa enters the brain. The other choices are not appropriate because neither
peripheral decarboxylase, nor COMT, nor monoamine oxidase metabolizes amantadine or the direct-acting
dopamine agonists ropinirole and pramipexole; thus carbidopa and entacapone should only be given with
levodopa, otherwise they are not contributing to the clinical response of the patient.
Peripheral adverse effects of levodopa, including nausea, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias, can be
diminished by including which drug in the therapy?
A.  Amantadine
B.  Ropinirole
C.  Carbidopa
D.  Entacapone
Correct answer = C. Carbidopa inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, thereby
diminishing the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects of levodopa. The other agents listed do not
ameliorate adverse effects of levodopa.
Which antiparkinsonian drug may cause vasospasm?
A.  Amantadine
B.  Bromocriptine
C.  Entacapone
D.  Ropinirole
Correct answer = B. Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist that may cause vasospasm. It is
contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Ropinirole directly stimulates dopamine receptors,
but it does not cause vasospasm. The other drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors.
Modest improvement in the memory of patients with Alzheimer disease may occur with drugs that increase
transmission at which receptor?
A.  Adrenergic
B.  Cholinergic
C.  Dopaminergic
D.  Serotonergic
Correct answer = B. AChE inhibitors, such as galantamine, increase cholinergic transmission in the CNS and may
cause a modest delay in the progression of Alzheimer disease. Increased transmission at the other types of
receptors listed does not result in improved memory.
A 70-year-old woman with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer type has been treated with an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for 6 months at maximum dosing with minimal effect. Which medication is a
glutamate receptor antagonist that could provide added benefit for management of her moderate to severe
symptoms of Alzheimer disease?
A.  Rivastigmine
B.  Pramipexole
C.  Memantine
D.  Galantamine
Correct answer = C. When combined with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, memantine has modest efficacy in
keeping patients with Alzheimer disease at or above baseline for at least 6 months and may delay disease
progression. It is currently not approved for mild cognitive impairment or mild AD.
An 80-year-old male patient with moderate Alzheimer disease had a short trial of an oral medication for
Alzheimer disease and experienced frequent nausea, along with difficulty swallowing the medication. Which
agent is best for management of Alzheimer disease in this patient?
334
8.7
8.8
8.9
8.10
A.  Rivastigmine
B.  Donepezil
C.  Memantine
D.  Rotigotine
Correct answer = A. Rivastigmine is the only agent available as a transdermal delivery system (patch) for the
treatment of Alzheimer disease. It may also be used for dementia associated with Parkinson disease. Daily use of
the rivastigmine patch provides steady drug levels to treat Alzheimer disease, with a possible reduced incidence
of nausea. Rotigotine is available as a transdermal delivery system; however, it is indicated for Parkinson disease
and not for Alzheimer disease.
Which medication would benefit a 55-year-old female patient recently diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS)?
A.  Pramipexole
B.  Galantamine
C.  Riluzole
D.  Glatiramer
Correct answer = C. Riluzole is approved for the debilitating and lethal illness of ALS. It is used to, ideally, delay
the progression and need for ventilator support in severe patients. It is believed to work by decreasing the release
of glutamate from the presynaptic terminal.
A 48-year-old woman with relapsing multiple sclerosis has had intolerable adverse reactions to interferon
beta (depression) and dimethyl fumarate (angioedema) and now requires an alternative treatment option.
Which medication is most appropriate for this patient?
A.  Riluzole
B.  Rotigotine
C.  Teriflunomide
D.  Galantamine
Correct answer = C. Teriflunomide is believed to exert its disease modifying and anti-inflammatory effects by
inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase to reduce pyrimidine synthesis. Teriflunomide may provide
an alternative treatment option with a different side effect profile compared to the prior two attempted treatments.
The other agents are not indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
Which agent may cause tremors as an adverse effect and, thus, should be used with caution in patients with
Parkinson disease, even though it is also indicated for the treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson
disease?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Rotigotine
C.  Rivastigmine
D.  Dimethyl fumarate
Correct answer = C. Though rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which can cause tremors as an
adverse effect, its use is not contraindicated in patients with Parkinson disease, as this agent is also the only
medication approved for dementia associated with Parkinson disease. It should be used with caution, as it may
worsen the parkinsonian-related tremors. A risk–benefit discussion should occur with the patient and the
caregiver before rivastigmine is used.
A 50-year-old male patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis reports continued difficulty
walking and the distance that he can walk before being overcome by fatigue. Which agent may be beneficial
to improve walking speed and disability in this patient?
A.  Dalfampridine
B.  Donepezil
C.  Riluzole
D.  Bromocriptine
Correct answer = A. Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker that exerts its therapeutic effect in multiple
sclerosis via potassium channel blockade and has been proven to improve walking speed and disability in patients
with multiple sclerosis. It is the only agent that is indicated to improve walking speed in patients with MS. The
other agents are not indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Anxiolytic and Hypnotic Drugs
Jose A. Rey
336
I.  Overview
Disorders involving anxiety are among the most common mental disorders. Anxiety is an unpleasant state of
tension, apprehension, or uneasiness (a fear that arises from either a known or an unknown source). The physical
symptoms of severe anxiety are similar to those of fear (such as tachycardia, sweating, trembling, and palpitations)
and involve sympathetic activation. Episodes of mild anxiety are common life experiences and do not warrant
treatment. However, severe, chronic, debilitating anxiety may be treated with antianxiety drugs (sometimes called
anxiolytics) and/or some form of psychotherapy. Because many antianxiety drugs also cause some sedation, they
may be used clinically as both anxiolytic and hypnotic (sleep-inducing) agents. Figure 9.1 summarizes the anxiolytic
and hypnotic agents. Some antidepressants are also indicated for certain anxiety disorders; however, they are
discussed with the antidepressants (see Chapter 10).
337
338
Figure 9.1 Summary of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs.
339
II.  Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are widely used anxiolytic drugs. They have largely replaced barbiturates and meprobamate in the
treatment of anxiety and insomnia, because benzodiazepines are generally considered to be safer and more effective
(Figure 9.2). Though benzodiazepines are commonly used, they are not necessarily the best choice for anxiety or
insomnia. Certain antidepressants with anxiolytic action, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
are preferred in many cases, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and antihistamines may be preferable for insomnia.
Figure 9.2 Ratio of lethal dose to effective dose for morphine (an opioid, see Chapter
14), chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic, see Chapter 11), and the anxiolytic, hypnotic
drugs, phenobarbital and diazepam.
340
A.  Mechanism of action
The targets for benzodiazepine actions are the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. [Note: GABA is the major
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS).] The GABAA receptors are composed of a
combination of five α, β, and γ subunits that span the postsynaptic membrane (Figure 9.3). For each subunit, many
subtypes exist (for example, there are six subtypes of the α subunit). Binding of GABA to its receptor triggers an
opening of the central ion channel, allowing chloride through the pore. The influx of chloride ions causes
hyperpolarization of the neuron and decreases neurotransmission by inhibiting the formation of action potentials.
Benzodiazepines modulate GABA effects by binding to a specific, high-affinity site (distinct from the GABA-
binding site) located at the interface of the α subunit and the γ subunit on the GABAA receptor (Figure 9.3).
Benzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel openings produced by GABA. The clinical effects of individual
benzodiazepines correlate well with the binding affinity of each drug for the GABA receptor–chloride ion channel
complex.
Figure 9.3 Schematic diagram of benzodiazepine–GABA–chloride ion channel complex.
GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.
341
B.  Actions
All benzodiazepines exhibit the following actions to some extent:
1.  Reduction of anxiety
At low doses, the benzodiazepines are anxiolytic. They are thought to reduce anxiety by selectively enhancing
GABAergic transmission in neurons having the α2 subunit in their GABAA receptors, thereby inhibiting neuronal
circuits in the limbic system of the brain.
2.  Sedative/hypnotic
All benzodiazepines have sedative and calming properties, and some can produce hypnosis (artificially produced
sleep) at higher doses. The hypnotic effects are mediated by the α1-GABAA receptors.
3.  Anterograde amnesia
Temporary impairment of memory with the use of the benzodiazepines is also mediated by the α1-GABAA
receptors. The ability to learn and form new memories is also impaired.
4.  Anticonvulsant
This effect is partially, although not completely, mediated by α1-GABAA receptors.
5.  Muscle relaxant
At high doses, the benzodiazepines relax the spasticity of skeletal muscle, probably by increasing presynaptic
inhibition in the spinal cord, where the α2-GABAA receptors are largely located. [Note: Baclofen [BAK-loe-fen] is a
muscle relaxant that is believed to affect GABA receptors at the level of the spinal cord.]
342
C.  Therapeutic uses
The individual benzodiazepines show small differences in their relative anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative
properties. However, pharmacokinetic considerations are often important in choosing one benzodiazepine over
another.
1.  Anxiety disorders
Benzodiazepines are effective for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, performance anxiety, and extreme phobias, such as fear of flying. The
benzodiazepines are also useful in treating anxiety related to depression and schizophrenia. These drugs should be
reserved for severe anxiety and should not be used to manage the stress of everyday life. Because of their addictive
potential, they should only be used for short periods of time. The longer-acting agents, such as clonazepam [kloe-
NAZ-e-pam], lorazepam [lor-AZ-e-pam], and diazepam [dye-AZ-e-pam], are often preferred in patients with
anxiety that require prolonged treatment. The antianxiety effects of the benzodiazepines are less subject to tolerance
than the sedative and hypnotic effects. [Note: Tolerance is decreased responsiveness to repeated doses of the drug
that occurs when used for more than 1 to 2 weeks.] For panic disorders, alprazolam [al-PRAY-zoe-lam] is effective
for short- and long-term treatment, although it may cause withdrawal reactions in approximately 30% of patients.
2.  Sleep disorders
Benzodiazepine hypnotics decrease the latency to sleep onset and increase stage II of non–rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep. Both REM sleep and slow-wave sleep are decreased. In the treatment of insomnia, it is important to
balance the sedative effect needed at bedtime with the residual sedation (“hangover”) upon awakening. Short-acting
triazolam [try-AY-zoe-lam] is effective in treating individuals who have problems falling asleep. The risk of
withdrawal and rebound insomnia is higher with triazolam than with other agents. Intermediate-acting temazepam
[te-MAZ-e-pam] is useful for patients who experience frequent awakenings and have difficulty staying asleep.
Temazepam should be administered 1 to 2 hours before the desired bedtime. Long-acting flurazepam [flure-AZ-e-
pam] is rarely used, due to its extended half-life, which may result in excessive daytime sedation and accumulation
of the drug, especially in the elderly. Estazolam [eh-STAY-zoe-lam] and quazepam [QUAY-ze-pam] are considered
intermediate- and long-acting agents, respectively. In general, hypnotics should be used for only a limited time,
usually 1 to 3 weeks.
3.  Amnesia
The shorter-acting agents are often employed as premedication for anxiety-provoking and unpleasant procedures,
such as endoscopy, dental procedures, and angioplasty. They cause a form of conscious sedation, allowing the
patient to be receptive to instructions during these procedures. Midazolam [mi-DAY-zoe-lam] is a benzodiazepine
used to facilitate anterograde amnesia while providing sedation prior to anesthesia.
4.  Seizures
Clonazepam is occasionally used as an adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures, whereas lorazepam and
diazepam are the drugs of choice in terminating status epilepticus (see Chapter 12). Due to cross-tolerance,
chlordiazepoxide [klor-di-az-e-POX-ide], clorazepate [klor-AZ-e-pate], diazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam [ox-
AZ-e-pam] are useful in the acute treatment of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the risk of withdrawal-related
seizures.
5.  Muscular disorders
Diazepam is useful in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasms and in treating spasticity from degenerative disorders,
such as multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy.
343
D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption and distribution
The benzodiazepines are lipophilic. They are rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, distribute
throughout the body, and penetrate into the CNS.
2.  Duration of action
The half-lives of the benzodiazepines are important clinically, because the duration of action may determine the
therapeutic usefulness. The benzodiazepines can be roughly divided into short-, intermediate-, and long-acting
groups (Figure 9.4). The longer-acting agents form active metabolites with long half-lives. However, with some
benzodiazepines, the clinical duration of action does not correlate with the actual half-life (otherwise, a dose of
diazepam could conceivably be given only every other day, given its long half-life and active metabolites). This may
be due to receptor dissociation rates in the CNS and subsequent redistribution to fatty tissues and other areas.
344
345
Figure 9.4 Comparison of the durations of action of the benzodiazepines.
3.  Fate
Most benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal
system to compounds that are also active. For these benzodiazepines, the apparent half-life of the drug represents the
combined actions of the parent drug and its metabolites. The benzodiazepines are excreted in the urine as
glucuronides or oxidized metabolites. All benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may depress the CNS of the
newborn if given before birth. The benzodiazepines are not recommended for use during pregnancy. Nursing infants
may also be exposed to the drugs in breast milk.
346
E.  Dependence
Psychological and physical dependence can develop if high doses of benzodiazepines are given for a prolonged
period. All benzodiazepines are controlled substances. Abrupt discontinuation of these agents results in withdrawal
symptoms, including confusion, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tension, and (rarely) seizures.
Benzodiazepines with a short elimination half-life, such as triazolam, induce more abrupt and severe withdrawal
reactions than those seen with drugs that are slowly eliminated such as flurazepam (Figure 9.5).
Figure 9.5 Frequency of rebound insomnia resulting from discontinuation of
benzodiazepine therapy.
347
F.  Adverse effects
Drowsiness and confusion are the most common adverse effects of the benzodiazepines. Ataxia occurs at high doses
and precludes activities that require fine motor coordination, such as driving an automobile. Cognitive impairment
(decreased recall and retention of new knowledge) can occur with use of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines should
be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Alcohol and other CNS depressants enhance the sedative–hypnotic
effects of the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are, however, considerably less dangerous than the older anxiolytic
and hypnotic drugs. As a result, a drug overdose is seldom lethal unless other central depressants, such as alcohol or
opioids, are taken concurrently.
348
III.  Benzodiazepine Antagonist
Flumazenil [floo-MAZ-eh-nill] is a GABA receptor antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of benzodiazepines.
The drug is available for intravenous (IV) administration only. Onset is rapid, but the duration is short, with a half-
life of about 1 hour. Frequent administration may be necessary to maintain reversal of a long-acting benzodiazepine.
Administration of flumazenil may precipitate withdrawal in dependent patients or cause seizures if a benzodiazepine
is used to control seizure activity. Seizures may also result if the patient has a mixed ingestion with tricyclic
antidepressants or antipsychotics. Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and agitation are the most common adverse effects.
349
IV.  Other Anxiolytic Agents
350
A.  Antidepressants
Many antidepressants are effective in the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders and should be considered as first-
line agents, especially in patients with concerns for addiction or dependence. SSRIs (such as escitalopram or
paroxetine) or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, such as venlafaxine or duloxetine) may be used
alone or prescribed in combination with a benzodiazepine during the first week of treatment (Figure 9.6). After 4 to
6 weeks, when the antidepressant begins to produce an anxiolytic effect, the benzodiazepine dose can be tapered.
While only certain SSRIs or SNRIs have been approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders such as GAD, the
efficacy of these drugs is most likely a class effect. Long-term use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for
anxiety disorders is often required to maintain ongoing benefit and prevent relapse.
Figure 9.6 Treatment guideline for persistent anxiety.
351
B.  Buspirone
Buspirone [byoo-SPYE-rone] is useful for the chronic treatment of GAD and has an efficacy comparable to that of
benzodiazepines. It has a slow onset of action and is not effective for short-term or “as-needed” treatment of acute
anxiety. The actions of buspirone appear to be mediated by serotonin (5-HT1A) receptors, although it also displays
some affinity for D2 dopamine receptors and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Thus, its mode of action differs from that
of the benzodiazepines. In addition, buspirone lacks the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant properties of the
benzodiazepines. The frequency of adverse effects is low, with the most common effects being headache, dizziness,
nervousness, nausea, and light-headedness. Sedation and psychomotor and cognitive dysfunction are minimal, and
dependence is unlikely. Buspirone does not potentiate the CNS depression of alcohol. Figure 9.7 compares common
adverse effects of buspirone and the benzodiazepine alprazolam.
352
Figure 9.7 Comparison of common adverse effects of buspirone and alprazolam. Results
are expressed as the percentage of patients showing each symptom.
353
354
V.  Barbiturates
The barbiturates were formerly the mainstay of treatment to sedate patients or to induce and maintain sleep. They
have been largely replaced by the benzodiazepines, primarily because barbiturates induce tolerance and physical
dependence, are lethal in overdose, and are associated with severe withdrawal symptoms. All barbiturates are
controlled substances.
355
A.  Mechanism of action
The sedative–hypnotic action of the barbiturates is due to their interaction with GABAA receptors, which enhances
GABAergic transmission. The binding site of barbiturates on the GABA receptor is distinct from that of the
benzodiazepines. Barbiturates potentiate GABA action on chloride entry into the neuron by prolonging the duration
of the chloride channel openings. In addition, barbiturates can block excitatory glutamate receptors. These molecular
actions lead to decreased neuronal activity.
356
B.  Actions
Barbiturates are classified according to their duration of action (Figure 9.8). Long-acting phenobarbital [fee-noe-
BAR-bi-tal] has a duration of action greater than a day. Pentobarbital [pen-toe-BAR-bi-tal], secobarbital [see-koe-
BAR-bi-tal], amobarbital [am-oh-BAR-bi-tal], and butalbital [bu-TAL-bi-tal] are short-acting barbiturates.
Figure 9.8 Barbiturates classified according to their durations of action.
357
1.  Depression of CNS
At low doses, the barbiturates produce sedation (have a calming effect and reduce excitement). At higher doses, the
drugs cause hypnosis, followed by anesthesia (loss of feeling or sensation), and, finally, coma and death. Thus, any
degree of depression of the CNS is possible, depending on the dose. Barbiturates do not raise the pain threshold and
have no analgesic properties. They may even exacerbate pain. Chronic use leads to tolerance.
2.  Respiratory depression
Barbiturates suppress the hypoxic and chemoreceptor response to CO2, and overdose is followed by respiratory
depression and death.
358
C.  Therapeutic uses
1.  Anesthesia
The ultra–short-acting barbiturates have been historically used intravenously to induce anesthesia but have been
replaced by other agents.
2.  Anticonvulsant
Phenobarbital has specific anticonvulsant activity that is distinguished from the nonspecific CNS depression.
However, phenobarbital can depress cognitive development in children and decrease cognitive performance in
adults, and it should be used for seizures only if other therapies have failed. Similarly, phenobarbital may be used
for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus.
3.  Sedative/hypnotic
Barbiturates have been used as mild sedatives to relieve anxiety, nervous tension, and insomnia. When used as
hypnotics, they suppress REM sleep more than other stages. However, the use of barbiturates for insomnia is no
longer generally accepted, given their adverse effects and potential for tolerance. Butalbital is commonly used in
combination products (with acetaminophen and caffeine or aspirin and caffeine) as a sedative to assist in the
management of tension or migraine headaches.
359
D.  Pharmacokinetics
Barbiturates are well absorbed after oral administration and distribute throughout the body. All barbiturates
redistribute from the brain to the splanchnic areas, to skeletal muscle, and, finally, to adipose tissue. Barbiturates
readily cross the placenta and can depress the fetus. These agents are metabolized in the liver, and inactive
metabolites are excreted in urine.
360
E.  Adverse effects
Barbiturates cause drowsiness, impaired concentration, and mental and psychomotor impairment (Figure 9.9). The
CNS depressant effects of barbiturates synergize with those of ethanol.
361
362
Figure 9.9 Adverse effects of barbiturates.
Hypnotic doses of barbiturates produce a drug “hangover” that may lead to impaired ability to function normally for
many hours after waking. Occasionally, nausea and dizziness occur. Barbiturates induce cytochrome P450
(CYP450) microsomal enzymes in the liver. Therefore, chronic barbiturate administration diminishes the action of
many drugs that are metabolized by the CYP450 system. Barbiturates are contraindicated in patients with acute
intermittent porphyria. Abrupt withdrawal from barbiturates may cause tremors, anxiety, weakness, restlessness,
nausea and vomiting, seizures, delirium, and cardiac arrest. Withdrawal is much more severe than that associated
with opioids and can result in death. Death may also result from overdose. Severe depression of respiration and
central cardiovascular depression results in a shock-like condition with shallow, infrequent breathing. Treatment
includes supportive care and gastric decontamination for recent ingestions.
363
VI.  Other Hypnotic Agents
364
A.  Zolpidem
The hypnotic zolpidem [ZOL-pi-dem] is not structurally related to benzodiazepines, but it binds to GABAA
receptors with relative selectivity for those with the α1 subunit. Zolpidem has no anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing
properties at hypnotic doses. It shows few withdrawal effects, exhibits minimal rebound insomnia, and little
tolerance occurs with prolonged use. Zolpidem is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It has a rapid onset of
action and short elimination half-life (about 2 to 3 hours). The drug provides a hypnotic effect for approximately 5
hours (Figure 9.10). [Note: A lingual spray and an extended-release formulation are also available. A sublingual
tablet formulation may be used for middle-of-the-night awakening.] Zolpidem undergoes hepatic oxidation by the
CYP450 system to inactive products. Thus, drugs such as rifampin, which induce this enzyme system, shorten the
half-life of zolpidem, and drugs that inhibit the CYP3A4 isoenzyme may increase the half-life. Adverse effects of
zolpidem include headache, dizziness, anterograde amnesia, and next-morning impairment (especially with
extended-release formulations). Sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and performing other activities while not fully awake
have been reported. Unlike the benzodiazepines, at usual hypnotic doses, the nonbenzodiazepine drugs, zolpidem,
zaleplon, and eszopiclone, do not significantly alter the various sleep stages and, hence, are often the preferred
hypnotics. All three agents are controlled substances.
Figure 9.10 Onset and duration of action of the commonly used nonbenzodiazepine
hypnotic agents.
365
B.  Zaleplon
Zaleplon [ZAL-e-plon] is an oral nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic similar to zolpidem; however, zaleplon causes fewer
residual effects on psychomotor and cognitive function compared to zolpidem or the benzodiazepines. This may be
due to its rapid elimination, with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. The drug is metabolized by CYP3A4.
366
C.  Eszopiclone
Eszopiclone [es-ZOE-pi-clone] is an oral nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that has been shown to be effective for
insomnia for up to 6 months. Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed (time to peak, 1 hour), extensively metabolized by
oxidation and demethylation via the CYP450 system, and mainly excreted in urine. Elimination half-life is
approximately 6 hours. Adverse events with eszopiclone include anxiety, dry mouth, headache, peripheral edema,
somnolence, and unpleasant taste.
367
D.  Melatonin receptor agonists
Ramelteon [ram-EL-tee-on] and tasimelteon [tas-i-MEL-tee-on] are selective agonists at the MT1 and MT2 subtypes
of melatonin receptors. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland that helps to maintain the circadian
rhythm underlying the normal sleep–wake cycle. Stimulation of MT1 and MT2 receptors by ramelteon and
tasimelteon is thought to induce and promote sleep. They have minimal potential for abuse, and no evidence of
dependence or withdrawal has been observed. Therefore, ramelteon and tasimelteon can be administered long-term.
Ramelteon is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep (increased sleep
latency). Common adverse effects of ramelteon include dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. Ramelteon may also
increase prolactin levels. Tasimelteon is indicated for non–24-hour sleep–wake disorder, often experienced by
patients who are blind. The most common adverse effects of tasimelteon are headache, abnormal dreams, increase in
liver function tests, and possible upper respiratory tract infections. CYP450 1A2 and 3A4 are the principle
isoenzymes required for metabolism of ramelteon and tasimelteon, and, thus, drug–drug interactions are possible
with inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.
368
E.  Antihistamines
Antihistamines with sedating properties, such as diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and doxylamine, are effective in
treating mild situational insomnia (see Chapter 37). However, they have undesirable adverse effects (such as
anticholinergic effects) that make them less useful than the benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepines. Sedative
antihistamines are marketed in numerous over-the-counter products.
369
F.  Antidepressants
The use of sedating antidepressants with strong antihistamine profiles has been ongoing for decades. Doxepin
[DOX-e-pin], an older tricyclic agent with SNRI mechanisms of antidepressant and anxiolytic action, is approved at
low doses for the management of insomnia. Other antidepressants, such as trazodone [TRAZ-oh-done], mirtazapine
[mir-TAZ-a-pine], and other older tricyclic antidepressants with strong antihistamine properties are used off-label
for the treatment of insomnia (see Chapter 10).
370
G.  Suvorexant
Suvorexant [soo-voe-REX-ant] is an antagonist of the orexin receptor. Orexin is a neuropeptide that promotes
wakefulness. Antagonism of the effects of orexin suppresses the wake drive from this neuropeptide. This
antagonism may also explain the adverse events that are similar to signs of narcolepsy and cataplexy. The loss of
orexin-producing neurons is believed to be an underlying pathology for narcolepsy. Daytime somnolence and
increased suicidal ideation are other reported adverse effects. Suvorexant is mainly metabolized by CYP450 3A4,
and, thus, it may have drug interactions with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.
Figure 9.11 summarizes the therapeutic disadvantages and advantages of some of the anxiolytic and hypnotic
drugs.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which one of the following statements is correct regarding benzodiazepines?
A.  Benzodiazepines directly open chloride channels.
B.  Benzodiazepines show analgesic actions.
C.  Clinical improvement of anxiety requires 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with benzodiazepines.
D.  All benzodiazepines have some sedative effects.
Correct answer = D. Although all benzodiazepines can cause sedation, the drugs labeled “benzodiazepines” in
Figure 9.1 are promoted for the treatment of sleep disorder. Benzodiazepines enhance the binding of GABAA to
its receptor, which increases the permeability of chloride. The benzodiazepines do not relieve pain but may reduce
the anxiety associated with pain. Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the
benzodiazepines are effective within hours of administration. Benzodiazepines do not produce general anesthesia
and therefore are relatively safe drugs with a high therapeutic index.
Which one of the following is a short-acting hypnotic?
A.  Phenobarbital
B.  Diazepam
C.  Chlordiazepoxide
D.  Triazolam
Correct answer = D. Triazolam is a short-acting hypnotic agent. It causes little daytime sedation. The other
medications listed are longer acting with longer half-lives.
Which one of the following statements is correct regarding the anxiolytic and hypnotic agents?
A.  Diazepam and phenobarbital induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.
B.  Phenobarbital is useful in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria.
C.  Phenobarbital induces respiratory depression, which is enhanced by the consumption of ethanol.
D.  Buspirone has actions similar to those of benzodiazepines.
Correct answer = C. Barbiturates and ethanol are a potentially lethal combination because of a high risk for
respiratory depression. Only phenobarbital strongly induces the synthesis of the hepatic cytochrome P450 drug-
metabolizing system. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria. Buspirone
lacks the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant properties of the benzodiazepines and causes only minimal sedation.
A 45-year-old man who has been injured in a car accident is brought into the emergency department. His
blood alcohol level at admission is 275 mg/dL. Hospital records show a prior hospitalization for alcohol-
related seizures. His wife confirms that he has been drinking heavily for 3 weeks. What treatment should be
provided to the patient if he goes into withdrawal?
A.  No pharmacological treatment is necessary.
B.  Lorazepam.
C.  Phenytoin.
D.  Buspirone.
Correct answer = B. It is important to treat the seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines such
as chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, or the shorter-acting lorazepam are effective in controlling this problem. They are
less sedating than phenytoin, have fewer adverse effects, and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Buspirone will not
prevent the seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal.
A 36-year-old male patient reports difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 weeks but needs to be able to wake
up at 6 AM for work and doesn’t want any daytime sedation. Which medication is best to recommend for the
treatment of his insomnia?
A.  Temazepam
B.  Flurazepam
C.  Zaleplon
D.  Buspirone
Correct answer = C. Zaleplon has the shortest half-life and duration of action. Buspirone is not effective as a
hypnotic agent. Temazepam and flurazepam have a longer duration of action and reduce nighttime awakenings
but have a greater risk of daytime sedation or hangover effect compared with zaleplon.
A 45-year-old woman reports constant daytime anxiety about work and family problems. This is causing
difficulties functioning and participating in necessary daily activities. Which of the following agents has a
rapid anxiolytic effect and is best for the acute management of her anxiety?
A.  Buspirone
372
9.7
9.8
9.9
9.10
B.  Venlafaxine
C.  Lorazepam
D.  Escitalopram
Correct answer = C. The benzodiazepines have same-day, first-dose efficacy for anxiety, whereas the other agents
require 2 to 8 weeks for clinically significant improvement in anxiety to occur.
Which of the following sedative–hypnotic agents utilizes melatonin receptor agonist as the mechanism of
action to induce sleep?
A.  Zolpidem
B.  Eszopiclone
C.  Estazolam
D.  Tasimelteon
Correct answer = D. Tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist to promote sleep, especially in those individuals
with non–24-hour sleep–wake disorder. Zolpidem, eszopiclone, and estazolam all utilize the benzodiazepine
receptor.
A 50-year-old man presents with insomnia not responsive to sleep hygiene interventions. He has a long
history of alcohol and opioid abuse. He has been successfully sober for 10 years but is very concerned about
future addiction and dependence. Which is most appropriate to address insomnia and minimize the risk for
dependence in this patient?
A.  Zaleplon
B.  Flurazepam
C.  Doxepin
D.  Zolpidem
Correct answer = C. Only doxepin, a tricyclic agent with significant antihistaminergic properties, is considered to
have no risk of addiction or dependence. The other agents are all controlled substances with some risk for
addiction or dependence, especially when used for extended periods.
A 68-year-old female patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms of insomnia, especially difficulty falling
asleep. She is afraid of taking a medication that can negatively affect her memory and concentration, as she
is still working as a bookkeeper. She has been taking temazepam for the past 4 days and has noticed a
memory problem and would like to discontinue this medication. Which medication is most appropriate to
treat the insomnia and minimize the risk for cognitive impairment?
A.  Diphenhydramine
B.  Zolpidem
C.  Alprazolam
D.  Ramelteon
Correct answer = D. All of these agents, except ramelteon, have been associated with cognitive impairments,
including memory impairment. Diphenhydramine likely causes its cognitive problems from its anticholinergic
and antihistaminergic effects. Zolpidem and alprazolam are well-known causes of cognitive impairment,
including anterograde amnesia. Ramelteon is a noncontrolled hypnotic agent acting as a melatonin receptor
agonist. It is not considered to have a risk for cognitive impairment compared with the other agents listed.
An 18-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency room after an accidental overdose of alprazolam. She is
unconscious and not considered a regular user of any medications or illicit drugs. Which treatment could be
used to reverse the effect of the alprazolam overdose?
A.  Diazepam
B.  Ramelteon
C.  Flumazenil
D.  Naloxone
Correct answer = C. Flumazenil is only indicated to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines via antagonism of the
benzodiazepine receptor. It should be used with caution because of a risk of seizures if the patient has been a
long-time recipient of benzodiazepines or if the overdose attempt was with mixed drugs. Naloxone is an opioid
receptor antagonist. The other agents are not efficacious in reversing effects of benzodiazepines.

Antidepressants

I.  Overview
The symptoms of depression are feelings of sadness and hopelessness, as well as the inability to experience pleasure
in usual activities, changes in sleep patterns and appetite, loss of energy, and suicidal thoughts. Mania is
characterized by the opposite behavior: enthusiasm, anger, rapid thought and speech patterns, extreme self-
confidence, and impaired judgment. This chapter provides an overview of drugs used for the treatment of depression
and mania.
375
II.  Mechanism of Antidepressant Drugs
Most antidepressant drugs (Figure 10.1) potentiate, either directly or indirectly, the actions of norepinephrine and/or
serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. This, along with other evidence, led to the biogenic amine theory, which proposes that
depression is due to a deficiency of monoamines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, at certain key sites in the
brain. Conversely, the theory proposes that mania is caused by an overproduction of these neurotransmitters.
However, the biogenic amine theory of depression and mania is overly simplistic. It fails to explain the time course
for a therapeutic response, which usually occurs over several weeks compared to the immediate pharmacodynamic
effects of the agents, which are usually immediate. This suggests that decreased reuptake of neurotransmitters is
only an initial effect of the drugs, which may not be directly responsible for the antidepressant effects.
376
377
Figure 10.1 Summary of antidepressants. (Figure continues on next page)
378
III.  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a group of antidepressant drugs that specifically inhibit
serotonin reuptake, having 300- to 3000-fold greater selectivity for the serotonin transporter, as compared to the
norepinephrine transporter. This contrasts with the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) that nonselectively inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (Figure 10.2).
Moreover, the SSRIs have little blocking activity at muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and histaminic H1 receptors. Because
they have different adverse effects and are relatively safe in overdose, the SSRIs have largely replaced TCAs and
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) as the drugs of choice in treating depression. The SSRIs include fluoxetine
[floo-OX-e-teen] (the prototypic drug), citalopram [sye-TAL-oh-pram], escitalopram [es-sye-TAL-oh-pram],
fluvoxamine [floo-VOX-e-meen], paroxetine [pa-ROX-e-teen], and sertraline [SER-tra-leen]. Escitalopram is the
pure S-enantiomer of citalopram.
Figure 10.2 Relative receptor specificity of some antidepressant drugs. *Venlafaxine
inhibits norepinephrine reuptake only at high doses. ++++ = very strong affinity; +++ =
strong affinity; ++ = moderate affinity; + = weak affinity; 0 = little or no affinity.
379
A.  Actions
The SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin, leading to increased concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the
synaptic cleft. Antidepressants, including SSRIs, typically take at least 2 weeks to produce significant improvement
in mood, and maximum benefit may require up to 12 weeks or more (Figure 10.3).
Figure 10.3 Onset of therapeutic effects of the major antidepressant drugs requires
several weeks.
380
B.  Therapeutic uses
The primary indication for SSRIs is depression. A number of other psychiatric disorders also respond favorably to
SSRIs, including obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, social anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and bulimia nervosa (only fluoxetine is approved
for bulimia).
381
C.  Pharmacokinetics
All of the SSRIs are well absorbed after oral administration. Peak levels are seen in approximately 2 to 8 hours on
average. Food has little effect on absorption (except with sertraline, for which food increases its absorption). The
majority of SSRIs have plasma half-lives that range between 16 and 36 hours. Metabolism by cytochrome P450
(CYP450)–dependent enzymes and glucuronide or sulfate conjugation occur extensively. Fluoxetine differs from the
other members of the class by having a much longer half-life (50 hours), and the half-life of its active metabolite S-
norfluoxetine is quite long, averaging 10 days. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of a CYP450
isoenzyme (CYP2D6). Other CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP2C9/19, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2) are involved with SSRI
metabolism and may also be inhibited to various degrees by the SSRIs.
382
D.  Adverse effects
Although the SSRIs are considered to have fewer and less severe adverse effects than the TCAs and MAOIs, the
SSRIs are not without adverse effects, such as headache, sweating, anxiety and agitation, hyponatremia,
gastrointestinal (GI) effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), weakness and fatigue, sexual dysfunction, changes in
weight, sleep disturbances (insomnia and somnolence), and the above-mentioned potential for drug–drug
interactions (Figure 10.4).
383
384
Figure 10.4 Some commonly observed adverse effects of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors.
1.  Sleep disturbances
Paroxetine and fluvoxamine are generally more sedating than activating, and they may be useful in patients who
have difficulty sleeping. Conversely, patients who are fatigued or complaining of excessive somnolence may benefit
from one of the more activating SSRIs, such as fluoxetine or sertraline.
2.  Sexual dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction, which may include loss of libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia, is common with the
SSRIs.
3.  Use in children and teenagers
Antidepressants should be used cautiously in children and teenagers, because of reports of suicidal ideation as a
result of SSRI treatment. Pediatric patients should be observed for worsening depression and suicidal thinking with
initiation or dosage change of any antidepressant. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are approved for use in
children to treat obsessive–compulsive disorder, and fluoxetine and escitalopram are approved to treat childhood
depression.
4.  Overdose
Overdose with SSRIs does not usually cause cardiac arrhythmias, with the exception of citalopram, which may
cause QT prolongation. Seizures are a possibility because all antidepressants may lower the seizure threshold. SSRIs
have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome, especially when used in the presence of an MAOI or other highly
serotonergic drug. Serotonin syndrome may include the symptoms of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, sweating,
myoclonus (clonic muscle twitching), and changes in mental status and vital signs.
5.  Discontinuation syndrome
SSRIs have the potential to cause a discontinuation syndrome after their abrupt withdrawal, particularly the agents
with shorter half-lives and inactive metabolites. Fluoxetine has the lowest risk of causing an SSRI discontinuation
syndrome due to its longer half-life and active metabolite. Possible signs and symptoms of SSRI discontinuation
syndrome include headache, malaise and flu-like symptoms, agitation and irritability, nervousness, and changes in
sleep pattern.
385
IV.  Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
Venlafaxine [VEN-la-fax-een], desvenlafaxine [dez-VEN-la-fax-een], levomilnacipran [lee-voe-mil-NA-si-pran],
and duloxetine [doo-LOX-e-teen] inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine (Figure 10.5) and, thus,
are termed SNRIs. Depression is often accompanied by chronic pain, such as backache and muscle aches, for which
SSRIs are relatively ineffective. This pain is, in part, modulated by serotonin and norepinephrine pathways in the
central nervous system. With dual inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, both the SNRIs and the
TCAs may be effective in relieving pain. These agents are also used in the treatment of pain syndromes, such as
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and low back pain. The SNRIs, unlike the
TCAs, have little activity at α-adrenergic, muscarinic, or histamine receptors and, thus, have fewer receptor-
mediated adverse effects than the TCAs. The SNRIs may precipitate a discontinuation syndrome if treatment is
abruptly stopped.
Figure 10.5 Proposed mechanism of action of selective serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs.
386
A.  Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine
Venlafaxine is an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and, at medium to higher doses, is an inhibitor of norepinephrine
reuptake. Venlafaxine has minimal inhibition of the CYP450 isoenzymes and is a substrate of the CYP2D6
isoenzyme. Desvenlafaxine is the active, demethylated metabolite of venlafaxine. The most common side effects of
venlafaxine are nausea, headache, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, insomnia, sedation, and constipation. At high doses,
there may be an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The clinical activity and adverse effect profile of
desvenlafaxine are similar to that of venlafaxine.
387
B.  Duloxetine
Duloxetine inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake at all doses. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to
inactive metabolites and should be avoided in patients with liver dysfunction. GI side effects are common with
duloxetine, including nausea, dry mouth, and constipation. Insomnia, dizziness, somnolence, sweating, and sexual
dysfunction are also seen. Duloxetine may increase blood pressure or heart rate. Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor
of CYP2D6 isoenzymes and may increase concentrations of drugs metabolized by this pathway, such as
antipsychotics.
388
C.  Levomilnacipran
Levomilnacipran is an enantiomer of milnacipran (an older SNRI used for the treatment of depression in Europe and
fibromyalgia in the United States). The adverse effect profile of levomilnacipran is similar to other SNRIs. It is
primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and, thus, activity may be altered by inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme
system.
389
V.  Atypical Antidepressants
The atypical antidepressants are a mixed group of agents that have actions at several different sites. This group
includes bupropion [byoo-PROE-pee-on], mirtazapine [mir-TAZ-a-peen], nefazodone [ne-FAZ-oh-done], trazodone
[TRAZ-oh-done], vilazodone [vil-AZ-oh-done], and vortioxetine [vor-TEE-ox-e-teen].
390
A.  Bupropion
Bupropion is a weak dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to alleviate the symptoms of
depression. Bupropion is also useful for decreasing cravings and attenuating withdrawal symptoms of nicotine in
patients trying to quit smoking. Side effects may include dry mouth, sweating, nervousness, tremor, and a dose-
dependent increased risk for seizures. It has a very low incidence of sexual dysfunction. Bupropion is metabolized
by the CYP2B6 pathway and has a relatively low risk for drug–drug interactions, given the few agents that
inhibit/induce this enzyme. Use of bupropion should be avoided in patients at risk for seizures or those who have
eating disorders such as bulimia.
391
B.  Mirtazapine
Mirtazapine enhances serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission by serving as an antagonist at central
presynaptic α2 receptors. Additionally, some of the antidepressant activity may be related to antagonism at 5-HT2
receptors. It is sedating because of its potent antihistaminic activity, but it does not cause the antimuscarinic side
effects of the TCAs or interfere with sexual function like the SSRIs. Sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain
frequently occur (Figure 10.6).
Figure 10.6 Some commonly observed adverse effects of mirtazapine.
392
C.  Nefazodone and trazodone
These drugs are weak inhibitors of serotonin reuptake and are also antagonists at the postsynaptic 5-HT2a receptor.
Both agents are sedating, probably because of their potent histamine H1-blocking activity. Trazodone is commonly
used off-label for the management of insomnia. Trazodone has been associated with priapism, and nefazodone has
been associated with a risk for hepatotoxicity. Both agents also have mild-to-moderate α1 receptor antagonism,
contributing to orthostasis and dizziness.
393
D.  Vilazodone
Vilazodone is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a 5-HT1a receptor partial agonist. Although the extent to which the
5-HT1a receptor activity contributes to its therapeutic effects is unknown, this possible mechanism of action renders
it unique from that of the SSRIs. The adverse effect profile of vilazodone is similar to the SSRIs, including a risk for
discontinuation syndrome if abruptly stopped.
394
E.  Vortioxetine
Vortioxetine utilizes a combination of serotonin reuptake inhibition, 5-HT1a agonism, and 5-HT3 and 5-HT7
antagonism as its suggested mechanisms of action to treat depression. It is unclear to what extent the activities other
than inhibition of serotonin reuptake influence the overall effects of vortioxetine. The common adverse effects
include nausea, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, which may be expected due to its serotonergic mechanisms.
395
VI.  Tricyclic Antidepressants
The TCAs inhibit norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake into the presynaptic neuron and, thus, if discovered today,
might have been referred to as SNRIs, except for their differences in adverse effects relative to this newer class of
antidepressants. The TCAs include the tertiary amines imipramine [ee-MIP-ra-meen] (the prototype drug),
amitriptyline [a-mee-TRIP-ti-leen], clomipramine [kloe-MIP-ra-meen], doxepin [DOX-e-pin], and trimipramine
[trye-MIP-ra-meen], and the secondary amines desipramine [dess-IP-ra-meen] and nortriptyline [nor-TRIP-ti-leen]
(the N-demethylated metabolites of imipramine and amitriptyline, respectively) and protriptyline [proe-TRIP-ti-
leen]. Maprotiline [ma-PROE-ti-leen] and amoxapine [a-MOX-a-peen] are related “tetracyclic” antidepressant
agents and are commonly included in the general class of TCAs.
396
A.  Mechanism of action
1.  Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake
TCAs and amoxapine are potent inhibitors of the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin into presynaptic
nerve terminals. Maprotiline and desipramine are relatively selective inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake.
2.  Blocking of receptors
TCAs also block serotonergic, α-adrenergic, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors. It is not known if any of these
actions produce the therapeutic benefit of the TCAs. However, actions at these receptors are likely responsible for
many of their adverse effects. Amoxapine also blocks 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors.
397
B.  Actions
The TCAs improve mood, in 50% to 70% of individuals with major depression. The onset of the mood elevation is
slow, requiring 2 weeks or longer (Figure 10.3). Patient response can be used to adjust dosage. Tapering of these
agents is recommended to minimize discontinuation syndromes and cholinergic rebound effects.
398
C.  Therapeutic uses
The TCAs are effective in treating moderate to severe depression. Some patients with panic disorder also respond to
TCAs. Imipramine is used as an alternative to desmopressin or nonpharmacologic therapies (enuresis alarms) in the
treatment of bed-wetting in children. The TCAs, particularly amitriptyline, have been used to help prevent migraine
headache and treat chronic pain syndromes (for example, neuropathic pain) in a number of conditions for which the
cause of pain is unclear. Low doses of TCAs, especially doxepin, can be used to treat insomnia.
399
D.  Pharmacokinetics
TCAs are well absorbed upon oral administration. As a result of their variable first-pass metabolism in the liver,
TCAs have low and inconsistent bioavailability. These drugs are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal system
(and, thus, may be sensitive to agents that induce or inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes) and conjugated with
glucuronic acid. Ultimately, the TCAs are excreted as inactive metabolites via the kidney.
400
E.  Adverse effects
Blockade of muscarinic receptors leads to blurred vision, xerostomia, urinary retention, sinus tachycardia,
constipation, and aggravation of angle-closure glaucoma (Figure 10.7). These agents affect cardiac conduction
similar to quinidine and may precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias in an overdose situation. The TCAs also block
α-adrenergic receptors, causing orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and reflex tachycardia. Sedation is related to the
ability of these drugs to block histamine H1 receptors. Weight gain is a common adverse effect of the TCAs. Sexual
dysfunction occurs in a minority of patients, and the incidence is lower than that associated with the SSRIs.
401
402
Figure 10.7 Some commonly observed adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants.
All antidepressants, including TCAs, should be used with caution in patients with bipolar disorder, even during their
depressed state, because antidepressants may cause a switch to manic behavior. The TCAs have a narrow therapeutic
index (for example, five- to six-fold the maximal daily dose of imipramine can be lethal). Depressed patients who
are suicidal should be given only limited quantities of these drugs and be monitored closely. Drug interactions with
the TCAs are shown in Figure 10.8. The TCAs may exacerbate certain medical conditions, such as benign prostatic
hyperplasia, epilepsy, and preexisting arrhythmias.

system; MAO = monoamine oxidase.
404
VII.  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial enzyme found in nerve and other tissues, such as the gut and liver. In
the neuron, MAO functions as a “safety valve” to oxidatively deaminate and inactivate any excess neurotransmitters
(for example, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) that may leak out of synaptic vesicles when the neuron is at
rest. The MAOIs may irreversibly or reversibly inactivate the enzyme, permitting neurotransmitters to escape
degradation and, therefore, to accumulate within the presynaptic neuron and leak into the synaptic space. The four
MAOIs currently available for the treatment of depression include phenelzine [FEN-el-zeen], tranylcypromine [tran-
il-SIP-roe-meen], isocarboxazid [eye-soe-car-BOX-ih-zid], and selegiline [seh-LEDGE-ah-leen]. [Note: Selegiline
is also used for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It is the only antidepressant available in a transdermal delivery
system.] Use of MAOIs is limited due to the complicated dietary restrictions required while taking these agents.
405
A.  Mechanism of action
Most MAOIs, such as phenelzine, form stable complexes with the enzyme, causing irreversible inactivation. This
results in increased stores of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine within the neuron and subsequent diffusion of
excess neurotransmitter into the synaptic space (Figure 10.9). These drugs inhibit not only MAO in the brain but
also MAO in the liver and gut that catalyzes oxidative deamination of drugs and potentially toxic substances, such as
tyramine, which is found in certain foods. The MAOIs, therefore, show a high incidence of drug–drug and drug–
food interactions. Selegiline administered as the transdermal patch may produce less inhibition of gut and hepatic
MAO at low doses because it avoids first-pass metabolism.
406
407
Figure 10.9 Mechanism of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
408
B.  Actions
Although MAO is fully inhibited after several days of treatment, the antidepressant action of the MAOIs, like that of
the SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs, is delayed several weeks. Selegiline and tranylcypromine have an amphetamine-like
stimulant effect that may produce agitation or insomnia.
409
C.  Therapeutic uses
The MAOIs are indicated for depressed patients who are unresponsive or intolerant of other antidepressants.
Because of their risk for drug–drug and drug–food interactions, the MAOIs are considered last-line agents in many
treatment settings.
410
D.  Pharmacokinetics
These drugs are well absorbed after oral administration. Enzyme regeneration, when irreversibly inactivated, varies,
but it usually occurs several weeks after termination of the drug. Thus, when switching antidepressant agents, a
minimum of 2 weeks of delay must be allowed after termination of MAOI therapy and the initiation of another
antidepressant from any other class. MAOIs are hepatically metabolized and excreted rapidly in urine.
411
E.  Adverse effects
Severe and often unpredictable side effects, due to drug–food and drug–drug interactions, limit the widespread use
of MAOIs. For example, tyramine, which is contained in foods, such as aged cheeses and meats, liver, pickled or
smoked fish, and red wines, is normally inactivated by MAO in the gut. Individuals receiving a MAOI are unable to
degrade tyramine obtained from the diet. Tyramine causes the release of large amounts of stored catecholamines
from nerve terminals, resulting in a hypertensive crisis, with signs and symptoms such as occipital headache, stiff
neck, tachycardia, nausea, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and, possibly, stroke. Patients must,
therefore, be educated to avoid tyramine-containing foods. Other possible adverse effects of treatment with MAOIs
include drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, blurred vision, dry mouth, and constipation. SSRIs should not be
coadministered with MAOIs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Both SSRIs and MAOIs require a washout
period of at least 2 weeks before the other type is administered, with the exception of fluoxetine, which should be
discontinued at least 6 weeks before an MAOI is initiated. In addition, the MAOIs have many other critical drug
interactions, and caution is required when administering these agents concurrently with other drugs. Figure 10.10
summarizes the side effects of the antidepressant drugs.
412
413

414
VIII.  Serotonin–Dopamine Antagonists
While 60% to 80% of patients respond favorably to antidepressants, 20% to 40% experience a partial or poor
response to monotherapy. The serotonin–dopamine antagonists (SDAs), or atypical antipsychotics, are occasionally
used as adjunctive treatments to antidepressants in partial responders. Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, quetiapine, and
the combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine are approved for use as adjuncts in major depressive disorder (MDD).
415
XI.  Treatment of Mania and Bipolar Disorder
The treatment of bipolar disorder has increased in recent years due to increased recognition of the disorder and also
an increase in the number of available medications for the treatment of mania.
416
A.  Lithium
Lithium salts are used acutely and prophylactically for managing bipolar patients. Lithium is effective in treating
60% to 80% of patients exhibiting mania and hypomania. Although many cellular processes are altered by treatment
with lithium, the mode of action is unknown. The therapeutic index of lithium is extremely low, and lithium can be
toxic. Common adverse effects may include headache, dry mouth, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, GI distress, fine
hand tremor, dizziness, fatigue, dermatologic reactions, and sedation. Adverse effects due to higher plasma levels
may indicate toxicity and include ataxia, slurred speech, coarse tremors, confusion, and convulsions. Thyroid
function may be decreased and should be monitored. Lithium is renally eliminated, and though caution should be
used when dosing this drug in renally impaired patients, it may be the best choice in patients with hepatic
impairment.
417
B.  Other drugs
Several antiepileptic drugs, including carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lamotrigine (see Chapter 12) are approved
as mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder. Other agents that may improve manic symptoms include the older
(chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and newer antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine,
ziprasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine, cariprazine, and quetiapine (see Chapter 11) are also used for the management
of mania. Quetiapine, lurasidone, and the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine have been approved for bipolar
depression.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 55-year-old teacher was diagnosed with depression. After 6 weeks of therapy with fluoxetine, his
symptoms improved, but he complains of sexual dysfunction. Which of the following drugs might be useful
for management of depression in this patient?
A.  Sertraline
B.  Citalopram
C.  Mirtazapine
D.  Lithium
Correct answer = C. Mirtazapine is largely free from sexual side effects. However, sexual dysfunction commonly
occurs with SSRIs (sertraline and citalopram), as well as with TCAs and SNRIs. Lithium is used for the treatment
of mania and bipolar disorder.
A 25-year-old woman has a long history of depressive symptoms accompanied by body aches and pain
secondary to a car accident. Which of the following drugs might be useful in this patient?
A.  Fluoxetine
B.  Sertraline
C.  Phenelzine
D.  Duloxetine
Correct answer = D. Duloxetine is an SNRI that can be used for depression accompanied by symptoms of pain.
SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and MAOIs (phenelzine) have little activity against pain syndromes.
A 51-year-old woman with symptoms of major depression also has angle-closure glaucoma. Which
antidepressant should be avoided in this patient?
A.  Amitriptyline
B.  Bupropion
C.  Mirtazapine
D.  Fluvoxamine
Correct answer = A. Because of its potent antimuscarinic activity, amitriptyline should not be given to patients
with glaucoma because of the risk of acute increases in intraocular pressure. The other antidepressants all lack
antagonist activity at the muscarinic receptor.
A 36-year-old man presents with symptoms of compulsive behavior. He realizes that his behavior is
interfering with his ability to accomplish his daily tasks but cannot seem to stop himself. Which drug would
be most helpful to this patient?
A.  Desipramine
B.  Paroxetine
C.  Amitriptyline
D.  Selegiline
Correct answer = B. SSRIs are particularly effective in treating obsessive–compulsive disorder, and paroxetine is
approved for this condition. The other drugs are less effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Which antidepressant has, as its two proposed principal mechanisms of action, 5-HT1a receptor partial
agonism and 5-HT reuptake inhibition?
A.  Fluoxetine
B.  Aripiprazole
C.  Maprotiline
D.  Vilazodone
Correct answer = D. In addition to inhibition of serotonin reuptake, the antidepressant activity of vilazodone may
be related to its 5-HT1a receptor agonism. Though aripiprazole is also proposed to have 5-HT1a partial agonism, it
is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Which antidepressant is the most sedating?
A.  Bupropion
B.  Duloxetine
C.  Doxepin
D.  Venlafaxine
Correct answer = C. Doxepin is the most sedating of the list due to its histamine-blocking activity.
419

10.10
Which mood stabilizer is completely renally eliminated and may be beneficial for patients with hepatic
impairment?
A.  Valproic acid
B.  Carbamazepine
C.  Lithium
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = C. Lithium is the only agent for bipolar disorder that does not require hepatic metabolism and,
thus, may be dosed without issue in a hepatically impaired patient. However, if the patient had renal impairment,
the lithium dosage would have to be adjusted.
Which antidepressant has, as its two principal mechanisms of action, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and α2
receptor antagonism?
A.  Fluoxetine
B.  Doxepin
C.  Maprotiline
D.  Mirtazapine
Correct answer = D. Mirtazapine is the only antidepressant with this combination of mechanisms of action that
are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.
Which mood-stabilizing agent is most likely to decrease the thyroid function?
A.  Carbamazepine
B.  Lithium
C.  Valproic acid
D.  Chlorpromazine
Correct answer = B. Lithium is best known for causing a drug-induced hypothyroidism in patients after long-term
use. Though it is possible with other mood stabilizers, lithium has the most reported cases, and thus, thyroid
function tests should be performed at baseline and during follow-up to monitor for this possible effect.
Which antidepressant agent has significant α1 receptor antagonism and, thus, is a poor choice in an elderly
female with depressive symptoms due to a higher risk of falls related to orthostatic hypotension?
A.  Venlafaxine
B.  Bupropion
C.  Escitalopram
D.  Amitriptyline
Correct answer = D. Venlafaxine, bupropion, and escitalopram have very little effect on decreasing blood
pressure (no α1 receptor antagonism) and are considered acceptable choices for treatment of depression in the
elderly. Amitriptyline is associated with a high risk for orthostasis in the elderly and should be avoided due to its
adverse effect profile and risk for falls.

Antipsychotic Drugs
Jose A. Rey
421
I.  Overview
The antipsychotic drugs are used primarily to treat schizophrenia, but they are also effective in other psychotic and
manic states. The use of antipsychotic medications involves a difficult trade-off between the benefit of alleviating
psychotic symptoms and the risk of a wide variety of adverse effects. Antipsychotic drugs (Figure 11.1) are not
curative and do not eliminate chronic thought disorders, but they often decrease the intensity of hallucinations and
delusions and permit the person with schizophrenia to function in a supportive environment.
422
Figure 11.1 Summary of antipsychotic agents.
423
II.  Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a type of chronic psychosis characterized by delusions, hallucinations (often in the form of voices),
and disturbances in thought. The onset of illness is often during late adolescence or early adulthood. It occurs in
about 1% of the population and is a chronic and disabling disorder. Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component
and probably reflects some fundamental developmental and biochemical abnormality, possibly a dysfunction of the
mesolimbic or mesocortical dopaminergic neuronal pathways.
424
III.  Antipsychotic Drugs
The antipsychotic drugs are usually divided into first- and second-generation agents. The first-generation drugs are
further classified as “low potency” or “high potency.” This classification does not indicate clinical effectiveness of
the drugs but rather specifies affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor, which, in turn, may influence the adverse effect
profile of the drug.
425
A.  First-generation antipsychotics
The first-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called conventional) are competitive inhibitors at a variety of
receptors, but their antipsychotic effects reflect competitive blockade of dopamine D2 receptors. First-generation
antipsychotics are more likely to be associated with movement disorders known as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS),
particularly drugs that bind tightly to dopaminergic neuroreceptors, such as haloperidol [HAL-oh-PER-i-dol].
Movement disorders are somewhat less likely with medications that bind less potently, such as chlorpromazine
[klor-PROE-ma-zeen]. No one drug is clinically more effective than another.
426
B.  Second-generation antipsychotic drugs
The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called “atypical” antipsychotics) have a lower incidence of EPS
than the first-generation agents but are associated with a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects, such as diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, and weight gain. The second-generation drugs owe their unique activity to blockade of both
serotonin and dopamine receptors.
1.  Drug selection
Second-generation agents are generally used as first-line therapy for schizophrenia to minimize the risk of
debilitating EPS associated with the first-generation drugs that act primarily at the dopamine D2 receptor. The
second-generation antipsychotics exhibit an efficacy that is equivalent to, and occasionally exceeds, that of the first-
generation antipsychotic agents. Differences in therapeutic efficacy among the second-generation drugs have not
been established, and individual patient response and comorbid conditions must often be used to guide drug
selection.
2.  Refractory patients
Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with schizophrenia have an insufficient response to first- and second-
generation antipsychotics. For these patients, clozapine [KLOE-za-peen] has shown to be an effective antipsychotic
with a minimal risk of EPS. However, its clinical use is limited to refractory patients because of serious adverse
effects. Clozapine can produce bone marrow suppression, seizures, and cardiovascular side effects, such as
orthostasis. The risk of severe agranulocytosis necessitates frequent monitoring of white blood cell counts.
427
C.  Mechanism of action
1.  Dopamine antagonism
All of the first-generation and most of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs block D2 dopamine receptors in the
brain and the periphery (Figure 11.2).
Figure 11.2 Dopamine-blocking actions of antipsychotic drugs.
2.  Serotonin receptor–blocking activity
Most of the second-generation agents exert part of their action through inhibition of serotonin receptors (5-HT),
particularly 5-HT2A receptors. Clozapine has high affinity for D1, D4, 5-HT2, muscarinic, and α-adrenergic
428
receptors, but it is also a weak dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (Figure 11.3). Risperidone [ris-PER-ih-dohn] blocks
5-HT2A receptors to a greater extent than it does D2 receptors, as does olanzapine [oh-LANZ-ah-peen]. The second-
generation antipsychotics aripiprazole [a-rih-PIP-ra-zole], brexpiprazole [brex-PIP-ra-zole], and cariprazine [kar-
IP-ra-zeen] are partial agonists at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, as well as antagonists of 5-HT2A receptors. Quetiapine
[qwe-TY-uh-peen] is relatively weak at blockade of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Its low risk for EPS may also be
related to the relatively short period of time it binds to the D2 receptor. Pimavanserin [pim-a-VAN-ser-in] appears to
act as an inverse agonist and antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and the 5-HT2C receptor, with no appreciable affinity
for dopamine receptors. Pimavanserin is indicated for psychosis associated with Parkinson disease.
Figure 11.3 Relative affinities of clozapine, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol at D1 and
D2 dopaminergic receptors.
429
430
D.  Actions
The clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs reflect a blockade at dopamine and/or serotonin receptors. However,
many antipsychotic agents also block cholinergic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors (Figure 11.4). It is
unknown what role, if any, these actions have in alleviating the symptoms of psychosis. However, the undesirable
adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs often result from pharmacological actions at these other receptors.
Figure 11.4 Antipsychotic drugs block dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors as well
as adrenergic, cholinergic, and histamine-binding receptors.
1.  Antipsychotic effects
All antipsychotic drugs can reduce hallucinations and delusions associated with schizophrenia (known as “positive”
symptoms) by blocking D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system of the brain. The “negative” symptoms, such as
blunted affect, apathy, and impaired attention, as well as cognitive impairment, are not as responsive to therapy,
particularly with the first-generation antipsychotics. Many second-generation agents, such as clozapine, can
ameliorate the negative symptoms to some extent.
2.  Extrapyramidal effects
Dystonias (sustained contraction of muscles leading to twisting, distorted postures), Parkinson-like symptoms,
akathisia (motor restlessness), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, usually of the tongue, lips, neck,
trunk, and limbs) can occur with both acute and chronic treatment. Blockade of dopamine receptors in the
nigrostriatal pathway is believed to cause these unwanted movement symptoms. The second-generation
antipsychotics exhibit a lower incidence of EPS.
3.  Antiemetic effects
The antipsychotic drugs have antiemetic effects that are mediated by blocking D2 receptors of the chemoreceptor
trigger zone of the medulla (see Chapter 40). Figure 11.5 summarizes the antiemetic uses of antipsychotic agents, as
well as other drugs that combat nausea.
431
432
Figure 11.5 Therapeutic application of antiemetic agents.
4.  Anticholinergic effects
Some of the antipsychotics, particularly thioridazine [THYE-oh-RID-a-zeen], chlorpromazine, clozapine, and
olanzapine, produce anticholinergic effects. These effects include blurred vision, dry mouth (the exception is
clozapine, which increases salivation), confusion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal and urinary tract smooth muscle,
leading to constipation and urinary retention. The anticholinergic effects may actually assist in reducing the risk of
EPS with these agents.
5.  Other effects
Blockade of α-adrenergic receptors causes orthostatic hypotension and light-headedness. The antipsychotics also
alter temperature-regulating mechanisms and can produce poikilothermia (condition in which body temperature
varies with the environment). In the pituitary, antipsychotics that block D2 receptors may cause an increase in
prolactin release. Sedation occurs with those drugs that are potent antagonists of the H1-histamine receptor,
including chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and clozapine. Sexual dysfunction may also occur with the
antipsychotics due to various receptor-binding characteristics. Weight gain is also a common adverse effect of
antipsychotics and is more significant with the second-generation agents.
433
E.  Therapeutic uses
1.  Treatment of schizophrenia
The antipsychotics are the only efficacious pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia. The first-generation
antipsychotics are generally most effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The atypical
antipsychotics with 5-HT2A receptor–blocking activity may be effective in many patients who are resistant to the
traditional agents, especially in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
2.  Prevention of nausea and vomiting
The older antipsychotics (most commonly, prochlorperazine [PROE-klor-PER-a-zeen]) are useful in the treatment
of drug-induced nausea.
3.  Other uses
The antipsychotic drugs can be used as tranquilizers to manage agitated and disruptive behavior secondary to other
disorders. Chlorpromazine is used to treat intractable hiccups. Pimozide [PIM-oh-zide] is primarily indicated for
treatment of the motor and phonic tics of Tourette disorder. However, risperidone and haloperidol are also
commonly prescribed for this tic disorder. Also, risperidone and aripiprazole are approved for the management of
disruptive behavior and irritability secondary to autism. Many antipsychotic agents are approved for the
management of the manic and mixed symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. Lurasidone [loo-RAS-i-done] and
quetiapine are indicated for the treatment of bipolar depression. Paliperidone [pal-ee-PER-i-dohn] is approved for
the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Some antipsychotics (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and quetiapine) are used
as adjunctive agents with antidepressants for treatment-refractory depression.
434
F.  Absorption and metabolism
After oral administration, the antipsychotics show variable absorption that is unaffected by food (except for
ziprasidone [zi-PRAS-i-done], lurasidone, and paliperidone, the absorption of which is increased with food). These
agents readily pass into the brain and have a large volume of distribution. They are metabolized to many different
metabolites, usually by the cytochrome P-450 system in the liver, particularly the CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4
isoenzymes. Some metabolites are active and have been developed as pharmacological agents themselves (for
example, paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, and the antidepressant amoxapine is the active
metabolite of loxapine). Fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, risperidone microspheres, paliperidone
palmitate, aripiprazole monohydrate, aripiprazole lauroxil, and olanzapine pamoate are long-acting injectable
(LAI) formulations of antipsychotics. These formulations usually have a therapeutic duration of action of 2 to 4
weeks, with some having a duration of 6 to 12 weeks. Therefore, these LAI formulations are often used to treat
outpatients and individuals who are nonadherent with oral medications.
435
G.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of the antipsychotic drugs can occur in practically all patients and are significant in about 80%
(Figure 11.6).
436
437
Figure 11.6 Adverse effects observed in individuals treated with antipsychotic drugs.
1.  Extrapyramidal effects
The inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons are normally balanced by the excitatory actions of cholinergic
neurons in the striatum. Blocking dopamine receptors alters this balance, causing a relative excess of cholinergic
influence, which results in extrapyramidal motor effects. The appearance of the movement disorders is generally
time- and dose dependent, with dystonias occurring within a few hours to days of treatment, followed by akathisias
occurring within days to weeks. Parkinson-like symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor usually occur within
weeks to months of initiating treatment. Tardive dyskinesia (see below), which can be irreversible, may occur after
months or years of treatment.
If cholinergic activity is also blocked, a new, more nearly normal balance is restored, and extrapyramidal effects
are minimized. This can be achieved by administration of an anticholinergic drug, such as benztropine [BENZ-troe-
peen]. The therapeutic trade-off is a lower incidence of EPS in exchange for the adverse effect of muscarinic
receptor blockade. Akathisia may respond better to β-blockers (for example, propranolol) or benzodiazepines, rather
than anticholinergic medications.
2.  Tardive dyskinesia
Long-term treatment with antipsychotics can cause this motor disorder. Patients display involuntary movements,
including bilateral and facial jaw movements and “fly-catching” motions of the tongue. A prolonged holiday from
antipsychotics may cause the symptoms to diminish or disappear within a few months. However, in many
individuals, tardive dyskinesia is irreversible and persists after discontinuation of therapy. Tardive dyskinesia is
postulated to result from an increased number of dopamine receptors that are synthesized as a compensatory
response to long-term dopamine receptor blockade. This makes the neuron supersensitive to the actions of
dopamine, and it allows the dopaminergic input to this structure to overpower the cholinergic input, causing excess
movement in the patient. Traditional anti-EPS medications may actually worsen this condition. Valbenazine [val-
BEN-a-zeen] and deutetrabenazine [doo-TET-ra-BEN-a-zeen] are inhibitors of the vesicular monoamine
transporter, and they are indicated for the management of tardive dyskinesia. These agents cause a decreased uptake
of monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion of monoamine stores, ideally focused on dopamine, to address
the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.
3.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
This potentially fatal reaction to antipsychotic drugs is characterized by muscle rigidity, fever, altered mental status
and stupor, unstable blood pressure, and myoglobinemia. Treatment necessitates discontinuation of the antipsychotic
agent and supportive therapy. Administration of dantrolene or bromocriptine may be helpful.
4.  Other effects
Drowsiness occurs during the first few weeks of treatment. These agents may also cause confusion. Those
antipsychotics with potent antimuscarinic activity often produce dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and loss
of visual accommodation. Others may block α-adrenergic receptors, resulting in lowered blood pressure and
orthostatic hypotension. The antipsychotics depress the hypothalamus, thereby affecting thermoregulation and
causing amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, infertility, and erectile dysfunction. Significant weight gain is
often a reason for nonadherence. Glucose and lipid profiles should be monitored in patients taking antipsychotics, as
the second-generation agents may increase these laboratory parameters and possibly exacerbate preexisting diabetes
or hyperlipidemia. Some antipsychotics have been associated with mild to significant QT prolongation. Thioridazine
has the highest risk, and ziprasidone and iloperidone [eye-low-PER-ee-dohn] also have cautions with their use due
to this effect. Other antipsychotics have a general precaution regarding QT prolongation, even if the risk is relatively
low.
5.  Cautions and contraindications
All antipsychotics may lower the seizure threshold and should be used cautiously in patients with seizure disorders
or those with an increased risk for seizures, such as withdrawal from alcohol. These agents also carry the warning of
increased risk for mortality when used in elderly patients with dementia-related behavioral disturbances and
psychosis. Antipsychotics used in patients with mood disorders should also be monitored for worsening of mood and
suicidal ideation or behaviors.
438
H.  Maintenance treatment
Patients who have had two or more psychotic episodes secondary to schizophrenia should receive maintenance
therapy for at least 5 years, and some experts prefer indefinite therapy. The rate of relapse may be lower with
second-generation drugs (Figure 11.7). Figure 11.8 summarizes the therapeutic uses of some of the antipsychotic
drugs.

therapy with either risperidone or haloperidol.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
An adolescent male is newly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Which antipsychotic agent may have the best
chance to improve his apathy and blunted affect?
A.  Chlorpromazine
B.  Fluphenazine
C.  Haloperidol
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = D. Risperidone is the only antipsychotic on the list that has some reported benefit in improving
the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All of the agents have the potential to diminish the hallucinations and
delusional thought processes (positive symptoms).
Which of the following antipsychotics is a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor?
A.  Brexpiprazole
B.  Clozapine
C.  Haloperidol
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = A. Brexpiprazole is the only agent listed that acts as a partial agonist at D2 receptors.
Theoretically, the drug enhances action at these receptors under low dopamine conditions and blocks activation
when dopamine levels are high. All of the other drugs are antagonistic at D2 receptors.
A 21-year-old man has recently begun pimozide therapy for Tourette disorder. He has been having
“different-appearing tics,” such as prolonged contraction of the facial muscles, and he experiences
opisthotonos (extrapyramidal spasm of the body in which the head and heels are bent backward and the body
is bowed forward). Which of the following drugs would be beneficial in reducing these symptoms?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Bromocriptine
C.  Prochlorperazine
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = A. The patient is experiencing EPS due to pimozide, and a muscarinic antagonist such as
benztropine would be effective in reducing the symptoms. The other drugs would have no effect or, in the case of
prochlorperazine and risperidone, might increase the adverse symptoms.
A 28-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder (combination of mood and psychotic symptoms) reports
difficulty falling asleep. Which of the following would be most beneficial in this patient?
A.  Olanzapine
B.  Haloperidol
C.  Paliperidone
D.  Ziprasidone
Correct answer = C. Paliperidone is the only agent that is approved for schizoaffective disorder. Olanzapine has
significant sedative activity as well as antipsychotic properties and is the drug most likely to alleviate this
patient’s report of insomnia. Although other antipsychotics may benefit this patient’s disorder, paliperidone has
the indication for this disorder, and if the underlying disorder is improved, then the symptom of insomnia may
also improve without risking other unwanted adverse effects, such as the weight gain associated with olanzapine.
Which of the following antipsychotic agents is considered to be the most potent and thus have the highest
risk of extrapyramidal symptoms?
A.  Thioridazine
B.  Haloperidol
C.  Quetiapine
D.  Chlorpromazine
Correct answer = B. Among the older, conventional, or typical antipsychotics on this list, haloperidol is the most
potent and would thus be expected to have the highest incidence of EPS. The atypical antipsychotics listed
(quetiapine) could be considered low potency based on their common dosing and are considered to have the
lowest risk for EPS.
Which antipsychotic has the most sedative potential and is sometimes, questionably, used as a hypnotic agent
in certain clinical settings?
A.  Fluphenazine
B.  Thiothixene
441
11.7
11.8
11.9
11.10
C.  Quetiapine
D.  Haloperidol
Correct answer = C. Quetiapine has strong antihistaminergic effects causing sedation and is sometimes used at
low doses as a sedative–hypnotic, even though this use is considered off-label. The other antipsychotic agents
listed are weaker at blocking the histamine receptor and therefore are not as sedating.
A 30-year-old male patient is treated with haloperidol for schizophrenia. His psychotic symptoms are well
managed with haloperidol; however, he is reporting restlessness, the inability to sit still at the dinner table,
and his family notices that he frequently paces the hallway. Which is the best agent to treat this
antipsychotic-induced akathisia?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Dantrolene
C.  Bromocriptine
D.  Propranolol
Correct answer = D. Propranolol, a β-blocker, is considered the drug of choice for the management of
antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Benztropine is more effective for pseudoparkinsonism and acute dystonias.
Bromocriptine is more effective for Parkinson-like symptoms, and dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is best
reserved for managing some symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Which antipsychotic agent is available in an LAI formulation that may be useful for patients with difficulty
adhering to therapy?
A.  Asenapine
B.  Chlorpromazine
C.  Clozapine
D.  Aripiprazole
Correct answer = D. Aripiprazole is available in two different LAI formulations. The other agents listed do not
have LAI formulations. Risperidone, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and paliperidone are other
antipsychotics that are available in LAI formulations.
Which antipsychotic agent is most associated with the possibility of a hematological dyscrasia such as
agranulocytosis in a patient being treated for schizophrenia?
A.  Chlorpromazine
B.  Buspirone
C.  Lithium
D.  Clozapine
Correct answer = D. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic medication that has a black box warning and a risk of
agranulocytosis in approximately 1% of the patients treated. This requires regular monitoring of white blood cell
counts. Although other antipsychotics have case reports of blood dyscrasias, clozapine is considered to have the
highest risk.
Which antipsychotic agent has been most associated with significant QT interval prolongation and should be
used with caution in patients with preexisting arrhythmias or patients taking other drugs associated with QT
prolongation?
A.  Thioridazine
B.  Risperidone
C.  Asenapine
D.  Lurasidone
Correct answer = A. Of the antipsychotic drugs listed, thioridazine has the highest risk for causing QT interval
prolongation. Although this is a general warning for many antipsychotics, thioridazine has been issued a “black
box warning,” suggesting that it is associated with the greatest risk.

I.  Overview
Approximately 10% of the population has at least one seizure in their lifetime. Globally, epilepsy is the fourth most
common neurologic disorder after migraine, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and Alzheimer’s disease. Epilepsy is
not a single entity but an assortment of different seizure types and syndromes originating from several mechanisms
that have in common the sudden, excessive, and synchronous discharge of cerebral neurons. This abnormal
electrical activity may result in a variety of events, including loss of consciousness, abnormal movements, atypical
or odd behavior, and distorted perceptions that are of limited duration but recur if untreated. The site of origin of
abnormal neuronal firing determines the symptoms that occur. For example, if the motor cortex is involved, the
patient may experience abnormal movements or a generalized convulsion. Seizures originating in the parietal or
occipital lobe may include visual, auditory, and olfactory hallucinations. Medications are the most widely used
mode of treatment for patients with epilepsy. In general, seizures can be controlled with one medication in
approximately 75% of patients. Patients may require more than one medication in order to optimize seizure control,
and some patients may never obtain total seizure control. A summary of antiseizure medications is shown in Figure
12.1.
444
Figure 12.1 Summary of agents used in the treatment of epilepsy.
445
II.  Etiology of Seizures
Epilepsy can be due to an underlying genetic, structural, or metabolic cause or an unknown etiology. In most cases,
epilepsy has no identifiable cause. The neuronal discharge in epilepsy results from firing of a small population of
neurons in a specific area of the brain referred to as the “primary focus.” Focal areas that are functionally abnormal
may be triggered into activity by changes in physiologic factors, such as an alteration in blood gases, pH,
electrolytes, and blood glucose and changes in environmental factors, such as sleep deprivation, alcohol intake, and
stress. A number of causes, such as illicit drug use, tumor, head injury, hypoglycemia, meningeal infection, and the
rapid withdrawal of alcohol from an alcoholic, can precipitate seizures. In cases when the source of a seizure can be
determined and corrected, medication may not be necessary. For example, a seizure that is caused by a drug reaction
is not epilepsy and does not require chronic therapy. In other situations, antiseizure medications may be needed
when the primary cause of the seizures cannot be corrected. Though multiple specific epilepsy syndromes that
include symptoms other than seizures have been classified, a discussion of these syndromes is beyond the scope of
this chapter.
446
III.  Classification of Seizures
It is important to correctly classify seizures to determine appropriate treatment. Seizures have been categorized by
site of origin, etiology, electrophysiologic correlation, and clinical presentation. Nomenclature developed by the
International League Against Epilepsy is considered the standard classification for seizures and epilepsy syndromes
(Figure 12.2). Seizures have been classified into two broad groups: focal and generalized.
Figure 12.2 Classification of epilepsy.
447
A.  Focal
Focal seizures involve only a portion of one hemisphere of the brain. The symptoms of each seizure type depend on
the site of neuronal discharge and on the extent to which the electrical activity spreads to other neurons in the brain.
Focal seizures may progress to become bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Patients may lose consciousness or
awareness. This seizure type may begin with a motor or nonmotor activity.
448
B.  Generalized
Generalized seizures may begin locally and then progress to include abnormal electrical discharges throughout both
hemispheres of the brain. Primary generalized seizures may be convulsive or nonconvulsive, and the patient usually
has an immediate loss of consciousness.
1.  Tonic–clonic
These seizures result in loss of consciousness, followed by tonic (continuous contraction) and clonic (rapid
contraction and relaxation) phases. The seizure may be followed by a period of confusion and exhaustion due to
depletion of glucose and energy stores.
2.  Absence
These seizures involve a brief, abrupt, and self-limiting loss of consciousness. The onset generally occurs in patients
at 3 to 5 years of age and lasts until puberty or beyond. The patient stares and exhibits rapid eye blinking, which
lasts for 3 to 5 seconds. An absence seizure has a very distinct three-per-second spike and wave discharge seen on
electroencephalogram.
3.  Myoclonic
These seizures consist of short episodes of muscle contractions that may recur for several minutes. They generally
occur after wakening and exhibit as brief jerks of the limbs. Myoclonic seizures occur at any age but usually begin
around puberty or early adulthood.
4.  Clonic
These seizures consist of short episodes of muscle contractions that may closely resemble myoclonic seizures.
Consciousness is more impaired with clonic seizures as compared to myoclonic.
5.  Tonic
These seizures involve increased tone in the extension muscles and are generally less than 60 seconds.
6.  Atonic
These seizures are also known as drop attacks and are characterized by a sudden loss of muscle tone.
449
C.  Mechanism of action of antiseizure medications
Drugs reduce seizures through mechanisms such as blocking voltage-gated channels (Na+ or Ca2+), enhancing
inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic impulses and interfering with excitatory glutamate transmission. Some
antiseizure medications appear to have multiple targets within the central nervous system (CNS), whereas the
mechanism of action for some agents is poorly defined. Antiseizure medications suppress seizures but do not “cure”
or “prevent” epilepsy.
450
IV.  Drug Selection
Choice of drug treatment is based on the classification of the seizures, patient-specific variables (for example, age,
comorbid medical conditions, lifestyle, and personal preference), and characteristics of the drug (such as cost and
drug interactions). For example, focal-onset seizures are treated with a different set of medications than primary
generalized seizures, although the list of effective agents overlaps. The toxicity of the agent and characteristics of
the patient are major considerations in drug selection. In newly diagnosed patients, monotherapy is instituted with a
single agent until seizures are controlled or toxicity occurs (Figure 12.3). Compared with those receiving
combination therapy, patients receiving monotherapy exhibit better medication adherence and fewer side effects. If
seizures are not controlled with the first medication, monotherapy with an alternate medication or the addition of
medications should be considered (Figure 12.4). Failing that, other medical management (vagal nerve stimulation,
surgery, etc.) should be considered. Awareness of the antiseizure medications available and their mechanisms of
action, pharmacokinetics, potential for drug–drug interactions, and adverse effects is essential for successful
treatment of the patient.

diazepam and lorazepam.
453
V.  Antiseizure Medications
The Food and Drug Administration has approved many new antiseizure medications in the last few decades. Some
of these agents are thought to have potential advantages over older drugs in terms of pharmacokinetics, tolerability,
and reduced risk for drug–drug interactions. However, studies have failed to demonstrate that the newer drugs are
significantly more efficacious than are the older agents. Figure 12.5 summarizes pharmacokinetic properties of the
antiseizure medications, and Figure 12.6 shows common adverse effects. Suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation
have been identified as a risk with antiseizure medications. In addition, virtually, all antiseizure medications have
been associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, a rare idiosyncratic reaction characterized by rash, fever,
and systemic organ involvement.
Figure 12.5 Summary of the pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications used as chronic
therapy.
454
455
Figure 12.6 Notable adverse effects of antiseizure medications.
456
A.  Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines bind to GABA inhibitory receptors to reduce the firing rate. Most benzodiazepines are reserved for
emergency or acute seizure treatment due to tolerance. However, clonazepam [kloe-NAY-ze-pam] and clobazam
[KLOE-ba-zam] may be prescribed as adjunctive therapy for particular types of seizures. Diazepam [dye-AZ-e-pam]
is also available for rectal administration to avoid or interrupt prolonged generalized tonic–clonic seizures or clusters
when oral administration is not possible.
457
B.  Brivaracetam
Brivaracetam [briv-a-RA-se-tam] is approved for treatment of focal-onset seizures in adults. It demonstrates high
and selective affinity for a synaptic vesicle protein (SV2A); however, the exact mechanism of antiseizure action is
unknown. The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and metabolized by both hydrolysis and CYP2C19
(minor). Comedication with strong CYP-inducing medications may lead to lower plasma concentrations.
Brivaracetam is a moderate inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase, resulting in increased levels of the active metabolite of
carbamazepine when the drugs are coadministered.
458
C.  Carbamazepine
Carbamazepine [kar-ba-MAZ-a-peen] blocks sodium channels, thereby possibly inhibiting the generation of
repetitive action potentials in the epileptic focus and preventing spread. Carbamazepine is effective for treatment of
focal seizures, generalized tonic–clonic seizures, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar disorder. It induces its own
metabolism, resulting in lower total carbamazepine blood concentrations at higher doses. Carbamazepine is an
inducer of the CYP1A2, CYP2C, CYP3A, and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, which increases the
clearance of other drugs (Figure 12.7). Hyponatremia may be noted in some patients, especially the elderly, and may
necessitate a change in medication. Carbamazepine should not be prescribed for patients with absence seizures
because it may cause an increase in seizures.
459
Figure 12.7 CYP metabolism of the antiseizure medications.
460
461
D.  Eslicarbazepine
Eslicarbazepine [es-li-kar-BAZ-a-peen] acetate is a prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite
eslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine) by hydrolysis. S-licarbazepine is the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine. It is a
voltage-gated sodium channel blocker and is approved for focal seizures in adults. Eslicarbazepine exhibits linear
pharmacokinetics and is eliminated via glucuronidation. The side effect profile includes dizziness, somnolence,
diplopia, and headache. Serious adverse reactions such as rash, psychiatric side effects, and hyponatremia occur
rarely.
462
E.  Ethosuximide
Ethosuximide [eth-oh-SUX-i-mide] reduces propagation of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, most likely by
inhibiting T-type calcium channels. It is most effective in treating absence seizures.
463
F.  Felbamate
Felbamate [FEL-ba-mate] has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant action with multiple proposed mechanisms
including the blocking of voltage-dependent sodium channels, competing with the glycine-binding site on the N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, blocking of calcium channels, and potentiating GABA action. It is
an inhibitor of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 and induces drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. It is reserved for use in
refractory epilepsies (particularly Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) because of the risk of aplastic anemia (about 1:4000)
and hepatic failure.
464
G.  Gabapentin
Gabapentin [GA-ba-pen-tin] is an analog of GABA. However, it does not act at GABA receptors, enhance GABA
actions or convert to GABA. Although gabapentin binds to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, the
precise mechanism of action is not known. It is approved as adjunct therapy for focal seizures and treatment of
postherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics (see Chapter 1) due to its uptake by a
saturable transport system from the gut. Gabapentin does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted unchanged
through the kidneys. Reduced dosing is required in renal disease. Gabapentin is well tolerated by the elderly
population with focal seizures due to its relatively mild adverse effects. It may also be a good choice for the older
patient because there are few drug interactions.
465
H.  Lacosamide
Lacosamide [la-KOE-sa-mide] affects voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable
neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. Lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator
protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. The
role of CRMP-2 binding in seizure control is unknown. Lacosamide is approved for adjunctive treatment of focal
seizures. The most common adverse events that limit treatment include dizziness, headache, and fatigue.
466
I.  Lamotrigine
Lamotrigine [la-MOE-tri-jeen] blocks sodium channels and high voltage–dependent calcium channels. Lamotrigine
is effective in a wide variety of seizure types, including focal, generalized, absence seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome. It is also used to treat bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is metabolized primarily to the 2-N-glucuronide
metabolite through the UGT1A4 pathway. As with other antiseizure medications, general inducers increase
lamotrigine clearance leading to lower lamotrigine concentrations, whereas divalproex results in a significant
decrease in lamotrigine clearance (higher lamotrigine concentrations). Lamotrigine dosages should be reduced when
adding valproate to therapy. Slow titration is necessary with lamotrigine (particularly when adding lamotrigine to a
regimen that includes valproate) due to risk of rash, which may progress to a serious, life-threatening reaction.
467
J.  Levetiracetam
Levetiracetam [lee-ve-tye-RA-se-tam] is approved for adjunct therapy of focal-onset, myoclonic, and primary
generalized tonic–clonic seizures in adults and children. It demonstrates high affinity for a synaptic vesicle protein
(SV2A). The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and is excreted in urine mostly unchanged, resulting in
few to no drug interactions. Levetiracetam can cause mood alterations that may require a dose reduction or a change
of medication.
468
K.  Oxcarbazepine
Oxcarbazepine [ox-kar-BAY-zeh-peen] is a prodrug that is rapidly reduced to the 10-monohydroxy (MHD)
metabolite responsible for its anticonvulsant activity. MHD blocks sodium channels and is thought to modulate
calcium channels. It is approved for use in adults and children with focal seizures. Oxcarbazepine is a less potent
inducer of CYP3A4 and UGT than is carbamazepine. The adverse effect of hyponatremia limits its use in the
elderly.
469
L.  Perampanel
Perampanel [per-AM-pa-nel] is a selective α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid antagonist
resulting in reduced excitatory activity. Perampanel has a long half-life enabling once-daily dosing. It is approved
for adjunctive treatment of focal and generalized tonic–clonic seizures. This medication has a warning for serious
psychiatric and behavioral reactions including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation.
470
M.  Phenobarbital and primidone
The primary mechanism of action of phenobarbital [fee-noe-BAR-bih-tal] is enhancement of the inhibitory effects
of GABA-mediated neurons (see Chapter 9). Primidone is metabolized to phenobarbital (major) and
phenylethylmalonamide, both with anticonvulsant activity. Phenobarbital is used primarily in the treatment of status
epilepticus when other agents fail.
471
N.  Phenytoin and fosphenytoin
Phenytoin [FEN-i-toin] blocks voltage-gated sodium channels by selectively binding to the channel in the inactive
state and slowing its rate of recovery. It is effective for treatment of focal and generalized tonic–clonic seizures and
in the treatment of status epilepticus. Phenytoin induces CYP2C and CYP3A families and the UGT enzyme system.
Phenytoin exhibits saturable enzyme metabolism resulting in nonlinear pharmacokinetic properties (small increases
in the daily dose can produce large increases in plasma concentration, resulting in drug-induced toxicity; Figure
12.8). Depression of the CNS occurs particularly in the cerebellum and vestibular system, causing nystagmus and
ataxia. The elderly are highly susceptible to this effect. Gingival hyperplasia may cause the gums to grow over the
teeth (Figure 12.9). Long-term use may lead to development of peripheral neuropathies and osteoporosis. Although
phenytoin is advantageous due to its low cost, the actual cost of therapy may be higher, considering the potential for
serious toxicity and adverse effects.
Figure 12.8 Nonlinear effect of phenytoin dosage on the plasma concentration of the
drug.
472
Figure 12.9 Gingival hyperplasia in patient treated with phenytoin.
Fosphenytoin [FOS-phen-i-toin] is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to phenytoin in the blood within minutes.
Whereas fosphenytoin may be administered intramuscularly (IM), phenytoin sodium should never be given IM, as it
causes tissue damage and necrosis. Fosphenytoin is the drug of choice and standard of care for IV and IM
administration of phenytoin.
473
O.  Pregabalin
Pregabalin [pree-GA-ba-lin] binds to the α2δ site, an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the
CNS, inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release. The drug has proven effects on focal-onset seizures, diabetic
peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia. More than 90% of pregabalin is eliminated renally.
It has no significant effects on drug metabolism and few drug interactions. Dosage adjustments are needed in renal
dysfunction.
474
P.  Rufinamide
Rufinamide [roo-FIN-a-mide] acts at sodium channels. It is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures
associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children one year of age and older and in adults. Rufinamide is a weak
inhibitor of CYP2E1 and a weak inducer of CYP3A4 enzymes. Food increases absorption and peak serum
concentrations. Serum concentrations of rufinamide are affected by other antiseizure medications. Carbamazepine
and phenytoin can reduce and valproate can increase the serum concentrations of rufinamide. Adverse effects
include the potential for shortened QT intervals. Patients with familial short QT syndrome should not be treated with
rufinamide.
475
Q.  Tiagabine
Tiagabine [ty-AG-a-been] blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons permitting more GABA to be available for
receptor binding and thereby enhancing inhibitory activity. Tiagabine is effective as adjunctive treatment in focal
seizures. In postmarketing surveillance, seizures have occurred in patients using tiagabine who did not have
epilepsy. Tiagabine should not be used for indications other than epilepsy.
476
R.  Topiramate
Topiramate [toe-PEER-a-mate] has multiple mechanisms of action. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels,
reduces high-voltage calcium currents (L type), is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and may act at glutamate (NMDA)
sites. Topiramate is effective for use in focal and primary generalized epilepsy. It is also approved for prevention of
migraine. It mildly inhibits CYP2C19 and coadministration with phenytoin and carbamazepine may reduce serum
concentrations of topiramate. Adverse effects include somnolence, weight loss, and paresthesias. Renal stones,
glaucoma, oligohidrosis (decreased sweating), and hyperthermia have also been reported.
477
S.  Valproic acid and divalproex
Possible mechanisms of action include sodium channel blockade, blockade of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), and
action at the T-type calcium channels. These varied mechanisms provide a broad spectrum of activity against
seizures. It is effective for the treatment of focal and primary generalized epilepsies. Valproic acid [val-PRO-ik A-
sid] is available as a free acid. Divalproex [dye-val-PRO-ex] sodium is a combination of sodium valproate [val-
PROE-ate] and valproic acid that is converted to valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. It was developed to
improve gastrointestinal tolerance of valproic acid. All of the available salt forms are equivalent in efficacy
(valproic acid and sodium valproate). Commercial products are available in multiple-salt dosage forms and
extended-release formulations. Therefore, the risk for medication errors is high, and it is essential to be familiar with
all preparations. Valproate inhibits metabolism of the CYP2C9, UGT, and epoxide hydrolase systems (Figure 12.7).
Rare hepatotoxicity may cause a rise in liver enzymes, which should be monitored frequently. Use in children under
age 2 and women should be avoided if possible.
478
T.  Vigabatrin
Vigabatrin [vye-GA-ba-trin] acts as an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-T. GABA-T is the enzyme responsible for
metabolism of GABA. Vigabatrin is associated with visual field loss ranging from mild to severe in 30% or more of
patients. Vigabatrin is only available through physicians and pharmacies that participate in the REMS (risk
evaluation and mitigation strategies) program.
479
U.  Zonisamide
Zonisamide [zoe-NIS-a-mide] is a sulfonamide derivative that has a broad spectrum of action. The compound has
multiple effects, including blockade of both voltage-gated sodium channels and T-type calcium currents. It has a
limited amount of carbonic anhydrase activity. Zonisamide is approved for use in patients with focal epilepsy. It is
metabolized by the CYP3A4 isozyme and may, to a lesser extent, be affected by CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. In
addition to typical CNS adverse effects, zonisamide may cause kidney stones. Oligohidrosis has been reported, and
patients should be monitored for increased body temperature and decreased sweating. Zonisamide is contraindicated
in patients with sulfonamide or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor hypersensitivity.
480
VI.  Status Epilepticus
In status epilepticus, two or more seizures occur without recovery of full consciousness in between episodes. These
may be focal or generalized, convulsive or nonconvulsive. Status epilepticus is life threatening and requires
emergency treatment usually consisting of parenteral administration of a fast-acting medication such as a
benzodiazepine, followed by a slower- acting medication such as phenytoin, fosphenytoin, divalproex, or
levetiracetam.
481
VII.  Women’s Health and Epilepsy
Women of childbearing potential with epilepsy require assessment of their antiseizure medications in regard to
contraception and pregnancy planning. Several antiseizure medications increase the metabolism of hormonal
contraceptives, potentially rendering them ineffective. These include phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine,
topiramate, oxcarbazepine, rufinamide, and clobazam. These medications increase the metabolism of contraceptives
regardless of the delivery system used (for example, patch, ring, implants, and oral tablets). Pregnancy planning is
vital, as many antiseizure medications have the potential to affect fetal development and cause birth defects. All
women considering pregnancy should be on high doses (1 to 5 mg) of folic acid prior to conception. Divalproex and
barbiturates should be avoided. If possible, women already taking divalproex should be placed on other therapies
before pregnancy and counseled about the potential for birth defects, including cognitive (Figure 12.10) and
behavioral abnormalities and neural tube defects. The pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications and the
frequency and severity of seizures may change during pregnancy. Regular monitoring by both an obstetrician and a
neurologist is important. All women with epilepsy should be encouraged to register with the Antiepileptic Drug
Pregnancy Registry. Figure 12.11 summarizes important characteristics of the antiseizure medications.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 9-year-old boy is sent for neurologic evaluation because of episodes of apparent inattention. Over the past
year, the child has experienced episodes during which he develops a blank look on his face and his eyes
blink for 15 seconds. He immediately resumes his previous activity. Which best describes seizures in this
patient?
A.  Focal
B.  Tonic–clonic
C.  Absence
D.  Myoclonic
Correct answer = C. The patient is experiencing episodes of absence seizures where consciousness is impaired
briefly. Absence seizures generally begin in children aged 4 to 12 years. Diagnosis includes obtaining an
electroencephalogram that shows generalized 3-Hz waves.
A child is experiencing absence seizures that interrupt his ability to pay attention during school and
activities. Which therapy is most appropriate for this patient?
A.  Ethosuximide
B.  Carbamazepine
C.  Diazepam
D.  Watchful waiting
Correct answer = A. The patient has had many seizures that interrupt his ability to pay attention during school and
activities, so therapy is justified. Carbamazepine may make the seizures more frequent. Diazepam is not indicated
for absence seizures.
Which drug is most useful for the treatment of absence seizures?
A.  Topiramate
B.  Tiagabine
C.  Levetiracetam
D.  Lamotrigine
Correct answer = D. Of the drugs listed, lamotrigine has the best data for use in absence seizures and is the best
choice. Tiagabine is only used for focal seizures. Topiramate and levetiracetam may be options if lamotrigine
does not work.
A 25-year-old woman with generalized seizures is well controlled on valproate. She indicates that she is
interested in becoming pregnant in the next year. With respect to her antiseizure medication, which of the
following should be considered?
A.  Leave her on her current therapy.
B.  Consider switching to lamotrigine.
C.  Consider adding a second antiseizure medication.
D.  Decrease her valproate dose.
Correct answer = B. Valproate is a poor choice in women of childbearing age and should be avoided if possible.
A review of the medication history of this patient is warranted. If she has not tried any other antiseizure
medication, then consideration of another antiseizure medication may be beneficial. Studies show that valproate
taken during pregnancy can have a detrimental effect on cognitive abilities in children. However, treatment with
valproate may not be avoidable as it could be the only choice for some women. In these cases, the lowest
effective dose should be used.
A woman with generalized seizures is well controlled with lamotrigine. She becomes pregnant and begins to
have breakthrough seizures. What is most likely happening?
A.  Her epilepsy is getting worse.
B.  Lamotrigine concentrations are increasing.
C.  Lamotrigine concentrations are decreasing.
D.  Lamotrigine is no longer efficacious for this patient.
Correct answer = C. Pregnancy alters the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. As pregnancy progresses, women can
require increased dosages to maintain blood concentrations and seizure control.
A 42-year-old man undergoes a neurologic evaluation because of episodes of apparent confusion. Over the
past year, the man has experienced episodes during which he develops a blank look on his face and fails to
respond to questions. Moreover, it appears to take several minutes before the man recovers from the
episodes. Which best describes this type of seizure?
A.  Focal (aware)

Correct answer = B. The patient is experiencing episodes of focal seizures with impaired consciousness.
Typically, staring is accompanied by impaired consciousness and recall. If asked a question, the patient might
respond with an inappropriate or unintelligible answer. Automatic movements are associated with most focal
seizures and involve the mouth and face (lip smacking, chewing, tasting, and swallowing movements), upper
extremities (fumbling, picking, tapping, or clasping movements), and vocal apparatus (grunts or repetition of
words and phrases), as are complex acts (such as walking or mixing foods in a bowl).
A 52-year-old man has had several focal seizures with impaired consciousness over the last year. Which is
the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?
A.  Ethosuximide
B.  Levetiracetam
C.  Diazepam
D.  Carbamazepine plus primidone
Correct answer = B. The patient has had many seizures, and the risks of not starting drug therapy would be
substantially greater than the risks of treating his seizures. Because the patient has impaired consciousness during
the seizure, he is at risk for injury during an attack. Monotherapy with primary agents is preferred for most
patients. The advantages of monotherapy include reduced frequency of adverse effects, absence of interactions
between antiepileptic drugs, lower cost, and improved compliance. Ethosuximide and diazepam are not indicated
for focal seizures.
A patient with focal seizures has been treated for 6 months with carbamazepine but, recently, has been
experiencing breakthrough seizures on a more frequent basis. You are considering adding a second drug to
the antiseizure regimen. Which of the following drugs is least likely to have a pharmacokinetic interaction
with carbamazepine?
A.  Topiramate
B.  Tiagabine
C.  Levetiracetam
D.  Lamotrigine
Correct answer = C. Of the drugs listed, all of which are approved as adjunct therapy for refractory focal seizures,
only levetiracetam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of other antiepileptic drugs, and other drugs do not
significantly alter its pharmacokinetics. However, any of the listed drugs could be added depending on the plan
and the patient characteristics. Treatment of epilepsy is complex, and diagnosis is based on history and may need
to be reevaluated when drug therapy fails or seizures increase.
Which is a first-line medication for generalized tonic–clonic seizures?
A.  Ethosuximide
B.  Felbamate
C.  Vigabatrin
D.  Topiramate
Correct answer = D. Topiramate is a broad-spectrum antiseizure medication that is indicated for primary
generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Ethosuximide should only be used for absence seizures. Felbamate is reserved
for refractory seizures due to the risk of aplastic anemia and liver failure. Vigabatrin is not indicated for
generalized seizures and is associated with visual field defects.
A 75-year-old woman had a stroke approximately 1 month ago. She is continuing to have small focal
seizures where she fails to respond appropriately while talking. Which is the most appropriate treatment for
this individual?
A.  Phenytoin
B.  Oxcarbazepine
C.  Levetiracetam
D.  Phenobarbital
Correct answer = C. Levetiracetam is renally cleared and prone to very few drug interactions. Elderly patients
usually have more comorbidities and take more medications than do younger patients. Oxcarbazepine may cause
hyponatremia, which is more symptomatic in the elderly. Phenytoin and phenobarbital have many drug
interactions and a side effect profile that may be especially troublesome in the elderly age group, including
dizziness that may lead to falls, cognitive issues, and bone health issues.

Anesthetics
Brandon Lopez and Chris Giordano
487
I.  Overview
For patients undergoing surgical or medical procedures, different levels of sedation can provide important benefits
to facilitate procedural interventions. These levels of sedation range from anxiolysis to general anesthesia and can
create:
Sedation and reduced anxiety
Lack of awareness and amnesia
Skeletal muscle relaxation
Suppression of undesirable reflexes
Analgesia
Because no single agent provides all desired objectives, several categories of drugs are combined to produce the
optimum level of sedation required (Figure 13.1). Drugs are chosen to provide safe and efficient sedation based on
the type and duration of the procedure and patient characteristics, such as organ function, medical conditions, and
concurrent medications (Figure 13.2). Preoperative medications provide anxiolysis and analgesia and mitigate
unwanted side effects of the anesthetic or the procedure itself. Neuromuscular blockers enable endotracheal
intubation and muscle relaxation to facilitate surgery. Potent general anesthetic medications are delivered via
inhalation and/or intravenously. Except for nitrous oxide, inhaled anesthetics are volatile, halogenated hydrocarbons,
while intravenous (IV) anesthetics consist of several chemically unrelated drug classes commonly used to rapidly
induce and/or maintain a state of general anesthesia.
488
489

anesthesia with higher doses. See Chapter 5 for summary of neuromuscular blocking
agents.
Figure 13.2 Overall considerations when delivering an anesthetic.
490
II.  Levels of Sedation
The levels of sedation occur in a dose-related continuum, which is variable and depends on individual patient
response to various drugs. These “artificial” levels of sedation start with light sedation (anxiolysis) and continue to
moderate sedation, then deep sedation, and finally a state of general anesthesia. The hallmarks of escalation from
one level to the next are recognized by changes in mentation, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory competency
(Figure 13.3). This escalation in levels is often very subtle and unpredictable; therefore, the sedation provider must
always be ready to manage the unanticipated next level of sedation.
Figure 13.3 Anesthetic levels of sedation.
491
III.  Stages of General Anesthesia
General anesthesia is a reversible state of central nervous system (CNS) depression, causing loss of response to and
perception of stimuli. The state of general anesthesia can be divided into three stages: induction, maintenance, and
recovery. Induction is the time from administration of a potent anesthetic to development of unconsciousness, while
maintenance is the sustained period of general anesthesia. Recovery starts with the discontinuation of the anesthetic
and continues until the return of consciousness and protective reflexes. Induction of anesthesia depends on how fast
effective concentrations of anesthetic reach the brain. Recovery is essentially the reverse of induction and depends
on how fast the anesthetic diffuses from the brain. The depth of general anesthesia is the degree to which the CNS is
depressed, as evident in electroencephalograms.
492
A.  Induction
General anesthesia in adults is normally induced with an IV agent like propofol, producing unconsciousness in 30 to
40 seconds. Often, an IV neuromuscular blocker such as rocuronium, vecuronium, or succinylcholine is
administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation by eliciting muscle relaxation. For children without IV access,
nonpungent volatile agents, such as sevoflurane, are administered via inhalation to induce general anesthesia.
493
B.  Maintenance of anesthesia
After administering the induction drug, vital signs and response to stimuli are vigilantly monitored to balance the
amount of drug continuously inhaled or infused to maintain general anesthesia. Maintenance is commonly provided
with volatile anesthetics, although total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with drugs like propofol can be used to
maintain general anesthesia. Opioids such as fentanyl are used for analgesia along with inhalation agents, because
the latter alter consciousness but not perception of pain.
494
C.  Recovery
After cessation of the maintenance anesthetic drug, the patient is evaluated for return of consciousness. For most
anesthetic agents, redistribution from the site of action (rather than metabolism of the drug) underlies recovery.
Neuromuscular blocking drugs are typically reversed after completion of surgery, unless enough time has elapsed
for their metabolism. The patient is monitored to assure full recovery of all normal physiologic functions
(spontaneous respiration, blood pressure, heart rate, and all protective reflexes).
495
IV.  Inhalation Anesthetics
Inhaled gases are used primarily for maintenance of anesthesia after administration of an IV drug (Figure 13.4).
Depth of anesthesia can be rapidly altered by changing the inhaled gas concentration. Inhalational agents have steep
dose–response curves with very narrow therapeutic indices, so the difference in concentrations from eliciting general
anesthesia to cardiopulmonary collapse is small. No antagonists exist. To minimize waste, inhaled gases are
delivered in a recirculation system that contains absorbents to remove carbon dioxide and allow rebreathing of the
gas. Recently, there has been greater attention to the anthropogenic emissions of these potent greenhouse gases,
which are typically released from hospital rooftops after each procedure.
Figure 13.4 Volatile anesthetics delivered to the patient are absorbed via the lungs into
the systemic circulation causing dose-dependent CNS depression.
496
A.  Common features of inhalation anesthetics
Modern inhalation anesthetics are nonflammable, nonexplosive agents, which include nitrous oxide and volatile,
halogenated hydrocarbons. These agents decrease cerebrovascular resistance, resulting in increased brain perfusion.
They cause bronchodilation but also decrease both respiratory drive and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
(increased pulmonary vascular resistance in poorly oxygenated regions of the lungs, redirecting blood flow to better
oxygenated regions). Movement of these gases from the lungs to various body compartments depends upon their
solubility in blood and tissues, as well as on blood flow. The following factors play a role in induction and recovery:
497
B.  Potency
Potency is defined quantitatively as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), which is the end-tidal
concentration of inhaled anesthetic needed to eliminate movement in 50% of patients exposed to a noxious stimulus.
MAC is the median effective dose (ED50) of the anesthetic, expressed as the percentage of gas in a mixture required
to achieve that effect. Numerically, MAC is small for potent anesthetics such as isoflurane and large for less potent
agents such as nitrous oxide. Thus, the inverse of MAC is an index of potency (Figure 13.5). Nitrous oxide alone
cannot produce general anesthesia because any admixture with a survivable oxygen percentage cannot reach its
MAC value. The more lipid soluble an anesthetic, the lower the concentration needed to produce anesthesia and,
therefore, the higher the potency. Factors that can increase MAC (make the patient more resistant) include
hyperthermia, drugs that increase CNS catecholamines, and chronic ethanol abuse. Factors that can decrease MAC
(make the patient more sensitive) include increased age, hypothermia, pregnancy, sepsis, acute intoxication,
concurrent IV anesthetics, and α2-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine and dexmedetomidine).
Figure 13.5 Minimal alveolar concentrations (MAC) for anesthetic gases are used to
compare pharmacologic effects of different agents (high MAC = low potency).
498
C.  Uptake and distribution of inhalation anesthetics
The principal objective of inhalation anesthesia is a constant and optimal brain partial pressure (Pbr) of inhaled
anesthetic (to create a partial pressure equilibrium between alveoli [Palv] and brain [Pbr]). Measuring the Palv is the
most practical and feasible way to ascertain the Pbr for the inhaled anesthetic concentration, but this necessitates
adequate time for the two compartments to reach equilibrium. The partial pressure of an anesthetic gas that
originates by pulmonary entry is the driving force moving the gas from the alveolar space into the bloodstream (Pa),
which transports the drug to the brain and other body compartments. Because gases move from one body
compartment to another according to partial pressure gradients, steady state is achieved when the partial pressure in
each of these compartments is equivalent to that in the inspired mixture. [Note: At equilibrium, Palv = Pa = Pbr.] The
time course for attaining this steady state is determined by the following factors:
1.  Alveolar wash-in
This refers to replacement of normal lung gases with the inspired anesthetic mixture. The time required for this
process is directly proportional to the functional residual capacity of the lung (volume of gas remaining in the lungs
at the end of a normal expiration) and inversely proportional to ventilatory rate. It is independent of the physical
properties of the gas. As the partial pressure builds within the lung, anesthetic gas transfer from the lung begins.
2.  Anesthetic uptake (removal to peripheral tissues other than the brain)
Uptake is the product of the gas solubility in the blood, cardiac output (CO), and gradient between alveolar and
blood anesthetic partial pressures.
a.  Solubility in blood
This is determined by a physical property of the anesthetic called the blood:gas partition coefficient (the ratio of the
concentration of anesthetic in the liquid [blood] phase to the concentration of anesthetic in the gas phase when the
anesthetic is in equilibrium between the two phases; Figure 13.6). For inhaled anesthetics, think of the blood as a
pharmacologically inactive reservoir. Drugs with low versus high blood solubility differ in their rate of induction of
anesthesia. When an anesthetic gas with low blood solubility such as nitrous oxide diffuses from the alveoli into the
circulation, little anesthetic dissolves in the blood. Therefore, equilibrium between the inspired anesthetic and
arterial blood occurs rapidly with relatively few additional molecules of anesthetic required to raise the arterial
anesthetic partial pressure. By contrast, anesthetic gases with high blood solubility, such as isoflurane, dissolve more
fully in the blood; therefore, greater amounts of gas and longer periods of time are required to raise blood partial
pressure. This results in longer periods for induction, recovery, and time to change in depth of anesthesia in response
to changes in the drug concentration. The solubility in blood is ranked as follows: isoflurane > sevoflurane > nitrous
oxide > desflurane.
499
Figure 13.6 Blood/gas partition coefficients for some inhalation anesthetics.
b.  Cardiac output
CO is inversely correlated with induction time for inhaled anesthetics. This counterintuitive phenomenon is
explained by the threshold of drug concentration required to alter neuronal activity and the time neurons are exposed
to the drug in the passing blood. During low CO, a longer period of time permits a larger concentration of gas to
dissolve in the slowly moving bloodstream. Furthermore, this large bolus of drug has longer contact time to diffuse
into neuronal tissue when it traverses the blood–brain barrier. Although a high CO will quickly transport the drug to
the brain, a lower concentration of the drug with a shorter exposure time slows down the rate of induction.
c.  Alveolar-to-venous partial pressure gradient
This gradient between the alveolar and returning venous gas partial pressure results from the tissue uptake from the
arterial delivery. The arterial circulation distributes the anesthetic to various tissues, and tissue uptake is dependent
on the tissue blood flow, blood-to-tissue partial pressure difference, and blood-to-tissue solubility coefficient. As
venous circulation returns to the lung blood with low or no dissolved anesthetic gas, this high gradient causes gas to
move from the alveoli into the blood. If a large alveolar-to-venous partial pressure gradient persists, the peripheral
tissue gas uptake must be high, and therefore, the induction time is longer. Over time, as the partial pressure of gas
in venous blood approximates the inspired mixture and subsequent alveolar concentration, no further uptake from
the lung occurs.
3.  Effect of different tissue types on anesthetic uptake
The time required for a tissue compartment to reach steady state with the partial pressure of the inspired anesthetic
gas is inversely proportional to the blood flow to that tissue (greater flow equals less time to reach equilibrium).
Time to steady state is directly proportional to the capacity of that tissue to store anesthetic (greater storage capacity
equals longer time to reach equilibrium). Furthermore, capacity is directly proportional to the volume of tissue and
the tissue:blood solubility coefficient of the gas. Four major tissue compartments determine the time course of
anesthetic uptake:
a.  Vessel-rich group (brain, heart, liver, kidney, and endocrine glands)
Highly perfused tissues rapidly attain steady state with the partial pressure of anesthetic in the blood.
b.  Skeletal muscles
500
These tissues are moderately perfused with a large storage capacity, which lengthens the time required to achieve
steady state.
c.  Fat
Fat is poorly perfused but has a very large storage capacity for the highly lipophilic volatile anesthetics. This poor
perfusion to a high-capacity compartment drastically prolongs the time required to achieve steady state.
d.  Vessel-poor group (bone, ligaments, and cartilage)
These are very poorly perfused and have a low capacity to store anesthetic gas. Therefore, these tissues have
minimal impact on the time course of anesthetic distribution in the body.
4.  Washout
When an inhalation anesthetic gas is removed from the inspired admixture, the body becomes the repository of
anesthetic gas to be circulated back to the alveolar compartment. The same factors that influence uptake and
equilibrium of the inspired anesthetic determine the time course of its exhalation from the body. Thus, nitrous oxide
exits the body faster than does isoflurane (Figure 13.7).
501
502
Figure 13.7 Changes in the alveolar blood concentrations of some inhalation anesthetics
over time.
503
D.  Mechanism of action
No specific receptor has been identified as the locus to create a state of general anesthesia. The fact that chemically
unrelated compounds produce unconsciousness argues against the existence of a single receptor, and it appears that a
variety of molecular mechanisms may contribute to the activity of anesthetics. At clinically effective concentrations,
general anesthetics increase the sensitivity of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors to the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA. This increases chloride ion influx and hyperpolarization of neurons. Postsynaptic neuronal
excitability and, thus, CNS activity are diminished (Figure 13.8). Unlike other anesthetics, nitrous oxide and
ketamine do not have actions on GABAA receptors. Their effects are mediated via inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors. [Note: The NMDA receptor is a glutamate receptor, which is the body’s main excitatory
neurotransmitter.] Receptors other than GABA that are affected by volatile anesthetics include the inhibitory glycine
receptors found in the spinal motor neurons. Additionally, inhalation anesthetics block excitatory postsynaptic
currents found on nicotinic receptors. However, the mechanisms by which anesthetics perform these modulatory
roles are not fully understood.
504
505

by inhaled anesthetics. GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid; Cl− = chloride ion.
506
E.  Isoflurane
Isoflurane [eye-so-FLOOR-ane], like other halogenated gases, produces dose-dependent hypotension predominantly
from relaxation of systemic vasculature. Hypotension can be treated with a direct-acting vasoconstrictor, such as
phenylephrine (see Chapter 6). Because it undergoes little metabolism, isoflurane is considered nontoxic to the liver
and kidney. Its pungent odor stimulates respiratory reflexes (breath holding, salivation, coughing, laryngospasm), so
it is not used for inhalation induction. With a higher blood solubility than desflurane and sevoflurane, isoflurane
takes longer to reach equilibrium, making it less ideal for short procedures; however, its low cost makes it a good
option for longer surgeries.
507
F.  Desflurane
Desflurane [DES-floor-ane] provides very rapid onset and recovery due to low blood solubility. This makes it a
popular anesthetic for short procedures. It has a low volatility, which requires administration via a special heated
vaporizer. Like isoflurane, it decreases vascular resistance and perfuses all major tissues very well. Desflurane has
significant respiratory irritation like isoflurane so it should not be used for inhalation induction. Its degradation is
minimal and tissue toxicity is rare. Higher cost occasionally prohibits its use.
508
G.  Sevoflurane
Sevoflurane [see-voe-FLOOR-ane] has low pungency or respiratory irritation. This makes it useful for inhalation
induction, especially with pediatric patients who do not tolerate IV placement. It has a rapid onset and recovery due
to low blood solubility. Sevoflurane has low hepatotoxic potential, but compounds formed from reactions in the
anesthesia circuit (soda lime) may be nephrotoxic with very low fresh gas flow that allows longer chemical reaction
time.
509
H.  Nitrous oxide
Nitrous oxide [NYE-truss OX-ide] (“laughing gas”) is a nonirritating potent sedative that is unable to create a state
of general anesthesia. It is frequently used at concentrations of 30% to 50% in combination with oxygen to create
moderate sedation, particularly in dentistry. Nitrous oxide does not depress respiration, and maintains cardiovascular
hemodynamics as well as muscular strength. Nitrous oxide can be combined with other inhalational agents to
establish general anesthesia, which lowers the required concentration of the combined volatile agent. This gas
admixture further reduces many unwanted side effects of the other volatile agent that impact cardiovascular output
and cerebral blood flow. Nitrous oxide is poorly soluble in blood and other tissues, allowing it to move very rapidly
in and out of the body. This can be problematic in closed body compartments because nitrous oxide can increase the
volume (exacerbating a pneumothorax) or pressure (sinus or middle ear pressure); it replaces nitrogen in various air
spaces faster than the nitrogen leaves. Its speed of movement allows nitrous oxide to retard oxygen uptake during
recovery, thereby causing “diffusion hypoxia.” This can be overcome by delivering high concentrations of inspired
oxygen during recovery. Some characteristics of the inhalation anesthetics are summarized in Figure 13.9.
510
Figure 13.9 Characteristics of some inhalation anesthetics.
511
I.  Malignant hyperthermia
In a very small percentage of susceptible patients, exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (or
succinylcholine) may induce malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare life-threatening condition. MH causes a drastic
and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, overwhelming the body’s capacity to supply
oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not
treated immediately. Strong evidence indicates that MH is due to an excitation–contraction coupling defect. Burn
victims and individuals with muscular dystrophy, myopathy, myotonia, and osteogenesis imperfecta are susceptible
to MH-like events and caution should be taken. Susceptibility to MH is often inherited as an autosomal dominant
disorder. Should a patient exhibit symptoms of MH, dantrolene is given as the anesthetic mixture is withdrawn, and
measures are taken to rapidly cool the patient. Dantrolene [DAN-troe-leen] blocks release of Ca2+ from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, reducing heat production and relaxing muscle tone. It should be available
whenever triggering agents are administered. In addition, the patient must be monitored and supported for
respiratory, circulatory, and renal problems. Use of dantrolene and avoidance of triggering agents such as
halogenated anesthetics in susceptible individuals have markedly reduced mortality from MH. A more soluble
formulation of dantrolene has become commercially available that drastically reduces the constitution time needed
to make this drug in emergencies.
512
V.  Intravenous Anesthetics
IV anesthetics cause rapid induction of anesthesia often occurring in 1 minute or less. It is the most common way to
induce anesthesia before maintenance of anesthesia with an inhalation agent. IV anesthetics may be used as single
agents for short procedures or administered as infusions (TIVA) to help maintain anesthesia during longer surgeries.
In lower doses, they may be used solely for sedation.
513
A.  Induction
After entering the blood, a percentage of drug binds to plasma proteins, and the rest remains unbound or “free.” The
degree of protein binding depends upon the physical characteristics of the drug, such as the degree of ionization and
lipid solubility. The majority of CO flows to the brain, liver, and kidney (“vessel-rich organs”). Thus, a high
proportion of initial drug bolus is delivered to the cerebral circulation and then passes along a concentration gradient
from blood into the brain. The rate of this transfer is dependent on the arterial concentration of the unbound free
drug, the lipid solubility of the drug, and the degree of ionization. Unbound, lipid-soluble, nonionized molecules
cross into the brain most quickly. Like inhalational anesthetics, the exact mode of action of IV anesthetics is
unknown; however, GABA likely plays a large role.
514
B.  Recovery
Recovery from IV anesthetics is due to redistribution from the CNS. After initial flooding of the CNS and other
vessel-rich tissues with nonionized molecules, the drug diffuses into other tissues with less blood supply. With
secondary tissue uptake, predominantly skeletal muscle, plasma concentration of the drug falls. This allows the drug
to diffuse out of the CNS, down the resulting reverse concentration gradient. This initial redistribution of drug into
other tissues leads to the rapid recovery seen after a single IV dose of induction agent. Metabolism and plasma
clearance become important only following infusions and repeat doses of a drug. Adipose tissue makes little
contribution to the early redistribution of free drug following a bolus, due to its poor blood supply. However,
following repeat doses or infusions, equilibration with fat tissue forms a drug reservoir, often leading to delayed
recovery.
515
C.  Effect of reduced cardiac output on IV anesthetics
When CO is reduced (for example, in certain types of shock, the elderly, cardiac disease), the body compensates by
diverting more CO to the cerebral circulation. A greater proportion of the IV anesthetic enters the cerebral
circulation under these circumstances. Therefore, the dose of the drug must be reduced. Further, decreased CO
causes prolonged circulation time. As global CO is reduced, it takes a longer time for an induction drug to reach the
brain and exert its effects. The slow titration of a reduced dose of an IV anesthetic is key to a safe induction in
patients with reduced CO.
516
D.  Propofol
Propofol [PRO-puh-fol] is an IV sedative/hypnotic used for induction and/or maintenance of anesthesia. It is widely
used and has replaced thiopental as the first choice for induction of general anesthesia and sedation. Because
propofol is poorly water soluble, it is supplied as an emulsion containing soybean oil and egg phospholipid, giving it
a milklike appearance.
1.  Onset
Induction is smooth and occurs 30 to 40 seconds after administration. Plasma levels decline rapidly as a result of
redistribution, followed by a more prolonged period of hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. The initial
redistribution half-life is 2 to 4 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of propofol are not altered by moderate hepatic or
renal failure.
2.  Actions
Although propofol depresses the CNS, it occasionally contributes to excitatory phenomena, such as muscle
twitching, spontaneous movement, yawning, and hiccups. Transient pain at the injection site is common. Propofol
decreases blood pressure without significantly depressing the myocardium. It also reduces intracranial pressure,
mainly due to decreased cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. It has less of a depressant effect than volatile
anesthetics on CNS-evoked potentials, making it useful for surgeries in which spinal cord function is monitored. It
does not provide analgesia, so supplementation with narcotics is required. Propofol is commonly infused in lower
doses to provide sedation. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is very low secondary to its
antiemetic properties.
517
E.  Barbiturates
Thiopental [THYE-oh-PEN-tahl] is an ultra–short-acting barbiturate with high lipid solubility. It is a potent
anesthetic but a weak analgesic. Barbiturates require supplementary analgesic administration during anesthesia.
When given IV, agents such as thiopental and methohexital [meth-oh-HEX-uh-tall] quickly enter the CNS and
depress function, often in less than 1 minute. However, diffusion out of the brain can also occur very rapidly
because of redistribution to other tissues (Figure 13.10). These drugs may remain in the body for relatively long
periods, because only about 15% of a dose entering the circulation is metabolized by the liver per hour. Thus,
metabolism of thiopental is much slower than its redistribution. Barbiturates tend to decrease blood pressure, which
may cause a reflex tachycardia. They decrease intracranial pressure through reductions in cerebral blood flow and
oxygen consumption. Thiopental is no longer available in many countries, including the United States. Methohexital
is still commonly used for electroconvulsive therapy.
Figure 13.10 Redistribution of thiopental from the brain to muscle and adipose tissue.
518
F.  Benzodiazepines
The benzodiazepines are used in conjunction with anesthetics for sedation and amnesia. The most commonly used is
midazolam [meh-DAZ-o-lam]. Diazepam [dye-AZ-uh-pam] and lorazepam [lore-AZ-uh-pam] are alternatives. All
three facilitate amnesia while causing sedation, enhancing the inhibitory effects of various neurotransmitters,
particularly GABA. Minimal cardiovascular depressant effects are seen, but all are potential respiratory depressants
(especially when administered IV). They are metabolized by the liver with variable elimination half-lives, and
erythromycin may prolong effects of midazolam. Benzodiazepines can induce a temporary form of anterograde
amnesia in which the patient retains memory of past events, but new information is not transferred into long-term
memory. Therefore, important treatment information should be repeated to the patient after the effects of the drug
have worn off.
519
G.  Opioids
Because of their analgesic property, opioids are commonly combined with other anesthetics. The choice of opioid is
based primarily on the duration of action needed. The most commonly used opioids are fentanyl [FEN-ta-nil] and its
congeners, sufentanil [SOO-fen-ta-nil] and remifentanil [REMI-fen-ta-nil], because they induce analgesia more
rapidly than morphine. They may be administered intravenously, epidurally, or intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal
fluid). Opioids are not good amnestics, and they can all cause hypotension and respiratory depression, as well as
nausea and vomiting. Opioid effects can be antagonized by naloxone.
520
H.  Etomidate
Etomidate [ee-TOM-uh-date] is a hypnotic agent used to induce anesthesia, but it lacks analgesic activity. Its water
solubility is poor, so it is formulated in a propylene glycol solution. Induction is rapid, and the drug is short-acting.
Among its benefits are little to no effect on the heart and systemic vascular resistance. Etomidate is usually only
used for patients with cardiovascular dysfunction or patients who are acutely critically ill. It inhibits 11-β
hydroxylase involved in steroidogenesis, and adverse effects may include decreased plasma cortisol and aldosterone
levels. Etomidate should not be infused for an extended time, because prolonged suppression of these hormones is
dangerous. Injection site pain, involuntary skeletal muscle movements, and nausea and vomiting are common.
521
I.  Ketamine
Ketamine [KET-uh-meen], a short-acting anti-NMDA receptor anesthetic and analgesic, induces a dissociated state
in which the patient is unconscious (but may appear to be awake) with profound analgesia. Ketamine stimulates
central sympathetic outflow, causing stimulation of the heart with increased blood pressure and CO. It is also a
potent bronchodilator. Therefore, it is beneficial in patients with hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock as well as
asthmatics. Conversely, it is contraindicated in hypertensive or stroke patients. The drug is lipophilic and enters the
brain very quickly. Like the barbiturates, it redistributes to other organs and tissues. Ketamine has become popular
as an adjunct to reduce opioid consumption during surgery. Of note, it may induce hallucinations, particularly in
young adults, but pretreatment with benzodiazepines may help. Ketamine may be used illicitly, since it causes a
dreamlike state and hallucinations similar to phencyclidine (PCP).
522
J.  Dexmedetomidine
Dexmedetomidine [dex-med-eh-TOM-uh-deen] is a sedative used in intensive care settings and surgery. Like
clonidine, it is an α2 receptor agonist in certain parts of the brain. Dexmedetomidine has sedative, analgesic,
sympatholytic, and anxiolytic effects that blunt many cardiovascular responses. It reduces volatile anesthetic,
sedative, and analgesic requirements without causing significant respiratory depression. It has gained popularity for
its ability to blunt emergence delirium in the pediatric population. Some therapeutic advantages and disadvantages
of the anesthetic agents are summarized in Figure 13.11.
Figure 13.11 Therapeutic disadvantages and advantages of some anesthetic agents.
523
VI.  Neuromuscular Blockers
Neuromuscular blockers are crucial to the practice of anesthesia and used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and
provide muscle relaxation when needed for surgery. Their mechanism of action is via blockade of nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on the skeletal muscle cell membrane. These agents include cisatracurium, mivacurium,
pancuronium, rocuronium, succinylcholine, and vecuronium (see Chapter 5).
524
A.  Sugammadex
Sugammadex [soo-GAM-ma-dex] is a selective relaxant-binding agent that terminates the action of both rocuronium
and vecuronium. Its three-dimensional structure traps the neuromuscular blocker in a 1:1 ratio, terminating its action
and making it water soluble. It is unique in that it produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound
neuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex is eliminated via the kidneys.
525
VII.  Local Anesthetics
Local anesthetics block nerve conduction of sensory impulses and in higher concentrations block motor impulses
from the periphery to the CNS. Sodium ion channels are blocked to prevent the transient increase in permeability of
the nerve membrane to Na+ that is required for an action potential (Figure 13.12). When propagation of action
potentials is prevented, sensation cannot be transmitted from the source of stimulation to the brain. Delivery
techniques include topical administration, infiltration, and perineural and neuraxial (spinal, epidural, or caudal)
blocks. Small, unmyelinated nerve fibers for pain, temperature, and autonomic activity are most sensitive.
Structurally, local anesthetics all include a lipophilic group joined by an amide or ester linkage to a carbon chain,
which, in turn, is joined to a hydrophilic group (Figure 13.13). The most widely used local anesthetics are
bupivacaine [byoo-PIV-uh-cane], lidocaine [LYE-doe-cane], mepivacaine [muh-PIV-uh-cane], ropivacaine [roe-
PIV-uh-cane], and tetracaine [TET-truh-cane].
Figure 13.12 Mechanism of local anesthetic action.
Figure 13.13 Representative structures of ester and amide anesthetics.
526
527
A.  Actions
Local anesthetics cause vasodilation, which leads to a rapid diffusion away from the site of action and short duration
when these drugs are administered alone. By adding the vasoconstrictor epinephrine, the rate of local anesthetic
absorption and diffusion is decreased. This minimizes systemic toxicity and increases the duration of action. Hepatic
function does not affect the duration of action of local anesthesia because that is determined by redistribution rather
than biotransformation. Some local anesthetics have other therapeutic uses (for example, lidocaine is an IV
antiarrhythmic).
528
B.  Onset, potency, and duration of action
The onset of action of local anesthetics is influenced by several factors including tissue pH, nerve morphology,
concentration, pKa, and lipid solubility of the drug. Of these, the pKa is most important. Local anesthetics with a
lower pKa have a quicker onset, since more drug exists in the unionized form at physiologic pH, thereby allowing
penetration of the nerve cell membrane. Once at the nerve membrane, the ionized form interacts with the protein
receptor of the Na+ channel to inhibit its function and achieve local anesthesia. The pH may drop in infected sites,
causing onset to be delayed or even prevented. Potency and duration of these agents depend mainly on lipid
solubility, with higher solubility correlating with increased potency and duration of action.
529
C.  Metabolism
Biotransformation of amides occurs primarily in the liver. Prilocaine [PRY-low-cane], a dental anesthetic, is also
metabolized in the plasma and kidney, and one of its metabolites may lead to methemoglobinemia. Esters are
biotransformed by plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase). Patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency may
metabolize ester local anesthetics more slowly. At normal doses, this has little clinical effect. Reduced hepatic
function predisposes patients to toxic effects, but should not significantly increase the duration of action of local
anesthetics.
530
D.  Allergic reactions
Patient reports of allergic reactions to local anesthetics are fairly common, but often times, reported “allergies” are
actually side effects from the coadministered epinephrine. True allergy to an amide local anesthetic is exceedingly
rare, while the ester procaine is more allergenic and has largely been removed from the market. Allergy to one ester
rules out use of another ester, because the allergenic component is the metabolite para-aminobenzoic acid, produced
by all esters. By contrast, allergy to one amide does not rule out the use of another amide. A patient may be allergic
to other compounds in the local anesthetic, such as preservatives in multidose vials.
531
E.  Local anesthetic systemic toxicity
Toxic blood levels of a local anesthetic may be due to repeated injections or could result from a single inadvertent
IV injection. Each drug has a weight-based toxic threshold that should be calculated. This is especially important in
children, the elderly, and women in labor (who are more susceptible to local anesthetics). Aspiration before every
injection is imperative. The signs, symptoms, and timing of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) are
unpredictable. One must consider the diagnosis in any patient with altered mental status, seizures, or cardiovascular
instability following injection of local anesthetic. Treatment for LAST may include seizure suppression, airway
management, and cardiopulmonary support. Administering a 20% lipid emulsion infusion (lipid rescue therapy) is a
valuable asset. Figure 13.14 summarizes pharmacologic properties of some local anesthetics.
Figure 13.14 Summary of pharmacologic properties of some local anesthetics. PABA =
para-aminobenzoic acid.
532
VIII.  Anesthetic Adjuncts
Adjuncts are a critical part of the practice of anesthesia and include drugs that affect gastrointestinal (GI) motility,
PONV, anxiety, and analgesia. Adjuncts are used in collaboration to help make the anesthetic experience safe and
pleasant.
533
A.  Gastrointestinal medications
H2-receptor antagonists (for example, ranitidine; see Chapter 40) and proton pump inhibitors (for example,
omeprazole; see Chapter 40) help to reduce gastric acidity in the event of an aspiration. Nonparticulate antacids
(sodium citrate/citric acid) are given occasionally to quickly increase the pH of stomach contents. These drugs are
used in the obstetric population going to surgery, along with other patients with reflux. Finally, a dopamine receptor
antagonist (metoclopramide) can be used as a prokinetic agent to speed gastric emptying and increase lower
esophageal sphincter tone.
534
B.  Medications for PONV
PONV can be a significant problem during and after surgery both for the clinician and the patient. Risk factors for
PONV include female gender, nonsmoker, use of volatile and nitrous anesthetics, duration of surgery, and
postoperative narcotic use. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (for example, ondansetron; see Chapter 40) are commonly
used to prevent PONV and are usually administered toward the end of surgery. Caution is advised in patients with
long QT intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG). An anticholinergic and antihistamine (promethazine) can also be
used; however, sedation, delirium, and confusion can complicate the postoperative period, especially in the elderly.
Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone can be used to reduce PONV. The mechanism is unclear, but because of a
longer onset, these agents are usually given at the start of surgery. The neurokinin-1 antagonist aprepitant has also
been shown to reduce PONV. Lastly, transdermal scopolamine is given preoperatively to patients with multiple risk
factors or a history of PONV. Caution is advised because it can produce central anticholinergic effects.
535
C.  Anxiety medications
Anxiety is a common part of the surgical experience. Benzodiazepines (midazolam, diazepam), α2 agonists
(clonidine, dexmedetomidine), and H1-receptor antagonists (diphenhydramine) can be used to alleviate anxiety.
Benzodiazepines also elicit anterograde amnesia, which can help promote a more pleasant surgical experience.
536
D.  Analgesia
While opioids are a mainstay in anesthesia for pain control, multimodal analgesia is becoming more common due to
the long-term risks of opioid consumption in surgical patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketorolac,
celecoxib; see Chapter 38) are common adjuncts to opioids. Caution should be used in patients with coagulopathies,
and in those with a history of peptic ulcer or platelet aggregation abnormalities. Acetaminophen can be used both PO
and IV, but caution is advised in impaired hepatic function. Analogs of GABA (gabapentin, pregabalin; see Chapter
12) are becoming more common as pretreatment to reduce opioid consumption both during and after surgery. They
also have multiple uses in neuropathic pain and addiction medicine. The NMDA antagonist ketamine is used to
reduce overall opioid consumption both intra- and postoperatively. Actions of anesthesia adjunct drugs are shown in
Figure 13.15.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Regarding levels of sedation, which one applies to loss of perception and sensation to painful stimuli?
A.  Anxiolysis
B.  General anesthesia
C.  Moderate sedation
D.  Deep sedation
Correct answer = B. Anxiolysis is a state of relaxation, but consciousness remains. General anesthesia is a total
loss of perception and sensation to stimuli. Moderate sedation maintains mentation with adequate airway and
respiratory competency. Deep sedation has some response to stimuli, but respirations may be inadequate.
Which of the following decreases minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)?
A.  Hyperthermia
B.  Cocaine intoxication
C.  Pregnancy
D.  Chronic ethanol abuse
Correct answer = C. Pregnancy is the only choice that decreases minimum alveolar concentration. All the other
options increase MAC.
Which of the following determines the speed of recovery from intravenous anesthetics used for induction?
A.  Liver metabolism of the drug
B.  Protein binding of the drug
C.  Ionization of the drug
D.  Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNS
Correct answer = D. Following initial flooding of the CNS with nonionized molecules, the drug diffuses into
other tissues. With secondary tissue uptake, the plasma concentration falls, allowing the drug to diffuse out of the
CNS. This initial redistribution of drug into other tissues leads to the rapid recovery seen after a single dose of an
IV induction drug. Protein binding, ionization, and lipid solubility affect the rate of transfer.
Which one of the following is a potent intravenous anesthetic and analgesic?
A.  Propofol
B.  Midazolam
C.  Ketamine
D.  Fentanyl
Correct answer = C. Ketamine is unique in its blockage of NMDA receptors, yielding both potent anesthetic and
analgesic properties. Propofol is a potent anesthetic but a weak analgesic. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam
have little analgesic effect, but can be a potent anesthetic at high doses. Fentanyl is a potent analgesic.
Which local anesthetic is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase?
A.  Tetracaine
B.  Bupivacaine
C.  Lidocaine
D.  Ropivacaine
Correct answer = A. Tetracaine is the only ester type local anesthetic of the choices. The other choices are amide-
type local anesthetics, which are metabolized by biotransformation in the liver. Remember that esters usually
have one “i” in the spelling, where amides typically have two “i”’s.
A 23-year-old patient with a history of severe postoperative nausea and vomiting is coming in for plastic
surgery. Which anesthetic drug would be best to use for maintenance in this situation?
A.  Isoflurane
B.  Sevoflurane
C.  Nitrous oxide
D.  Propofol
Correct answer = D. A propofol infusion (TIVA) anesthetic would be best for this patient with a history of
postoperative nausea and vomiting. Propofol is the only anesthetic listed with antiemetic properties. Both
fluorinated hydrocarbons (isoflurane and sevoflurane) and nitrous oxide are linked to nausea and vomiting during
surgery.
A 61-year-old patient with an acute myocardial infarction has severely reduced cardiac output. He has to
540

13.10
undergo emergent coronary artery bypass surgery. Which of the following would you expect in this patient?
A.  Faster induction time with IV anesthetics
B.  Need for increased dosage of IV anesthetics
C.  Faster induction time with inhaled anesthetics
D.  Enhanced removal of inhaled anesthetics to peripheral tissues
Correct answer = C. For inhaled anesthetics during low CO, a longer period of time permits a larger concentration
of gas to dissolve in the slowly moving bloodstream. Furthermore, this large bolus of drug has longer contact time
to diffuse into neuronal tissue when it traverses the blood–brain barrier, yielding a faster induction time. The dose
of an IV drug must be reduced (not increased). In addition, with reduced cardiac output, it takes a longer time for
an IV induction drug to reach the brain, resulting in a slower induction time.
A 70-year-old patient in the intensive care unit needs sedation due to prolonged endotracheal intubation.
Which of the following medications should be avoided for sedation in this patient?
A.  Fentanyl
B.  Etomidate
C.  Propofol
D.  Dexmedetomidine
Correct answer = B. Adverse effects of etomidate include decreased plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels by
inhibiting the 11-β hydroxylase enzyme. Etomidate should not be infused for an extended time, because
prolonged suppression of these hormones is dangerous. All of the other choices could be used for sedation in the
ICU setting.
A 35-year-old man presents with appendicitis and requires a surgical intervention. He has a family history of
malignant hyperthermia. Which anesthetic agent is most appropriate to use in this patient?
A.  Isoflurane
B.  Propofol
C.  Succinylcholine
D.  Sevoflurane
Correct answer = B. Propofol is the only medication listed that is safe in patients susceptible to malignant
hyperthermia. All fluorinated hydrocarbons (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane) as well as succinylcholine are
contraindicated and considered triggering agents. Flushing of the anesthesia machine, removal of vaporizers, use
of special filters, and availability of dantrolene are highly advised.
A 32-year-old woman presents for a right distal radius fracture. She requests regional anesthesia to help with
her pain postoperatively. She reports that as a child, she had an allergic reaction to Novocain (procaine) at
the dentist’s office. Which local anesthetic is appropriate for use in this patient?
A.  Chloroprocaine
B.  Benzocaine
C.  Ropivacaine
D.  Tetracaine
Correct answer = C. Procaine is an ester local anesthetic. Since this patient has an allergy to procaine, other ester
anesthetics (chloroprocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) should not be used. Benzocaine is mostly used as a topical
product for temporary relief of dental or oral pain. Ropivacaine is an amide local anesthetic commonly used in
regional anesthesia to facilitate peripheral nerve blockade.

Opioids
Robin Moorman Li
542
I.  Overview
Management of pain is one of clinical medicine’s greatest challenges. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensation that
can be either acute or chronic and is a consequence of complex neurochemical processes in the peripheral and
central nervous systems (CNS). It is subjective, and the clinician must rely on the patient’s perception and
description of pain. Alleviation of pain depends on the specific type of pain (nociceptive or neuropathic pain). For
example, with mild to moderate arthritic pain (nociceptive pain), nonopioid analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; see Chapter 38) are often effective. Neuropathic pain responds best to
anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, for severe acute
pain or chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain, opioids can be considered as part of the treatment plan in select
patients (Figure 14.1). Opioids are natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic compounds that produce morphine-like
effects (Figure 14.2). These agents are divided into chemical classes based on their chemical structure (Figure 14.3).
All opioids act by binding to specific opioid receptors in the CNS to produce effects that mimic the action of
endogenous peptide neurotransmitters (for example, endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins). Although the opioids
have a broad range of effects, their primary use is to relieve intense pain that results from surgery, injury, or chronic
disease. Unfortunately, widespread availability of opioids has led to abuse of agents with euphoric properties.
Antagonists that reverse the actions of opioids are also clinically important for use in cases of overdose (Figure
14.1).

545
546
Figure 14.3 Pharmacological classes of opioids and actions on opioid receptors.
547
II.  Opioid Receptors
The major effects of the opioids are mediated by three main receptor families, commonly designated as μ (mu,
MOR), κ (kappa, KOR), and δ (delta, DOR). Each receptor family exhibits a different specificity for the drug(s) it
binds. The analgesic properties of the opioids are primarily mediated by the mu receptors that modulate responses to
thermal, mechanical, and chemical nociception. The κ receptors in the dorsal horn also contribute to analgesia by
modulating the response to chemical and thermal nociception. The enkephalins interact more selectively with δ
receptors in the periphery. All three opioid receptors are members of the G protein–coupled receptor family and
inhibit adenylyl cyclase. They are also associated with ion channels, increasing postsynaptic K+ efflux
(hyperpolarization) or reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx, thus impeding neuronal firing and transmitter release in the
spinal dorsal horn (Figure 14.4).
548
549
Figure 14.4 Mechanism of action of μ opioid receptor agonists in the spinal cord.
550
III.  Opioid Agonists
Morphine [MOR-feen] is the prototypical strong μ receptor agonist. Codeine [KOE-deen] is inherently less potent
and the prototype of the weak μ opioid agonists. Currently available opioids have many differences, such as receptor
affinity, pharmacokinetic profiles, available routes of administration, and adverse effect profiles. Some opioids are
also available in abuse deterrent formulations. Comparing other available opioids to morphine is helpful in
identifying the unique differences to guide the selection of a safe and effective pain management regimen (Figure
14.5).
Figure 14.5 Summary of clinically relevant properties for selected opioids.
551
A.  Morphine
1.  Mechanism of action
Morphine and other opioids exert analgesic effects by interacting stereospecifically with opioid receptors on the
membranes of neuronal cells in the CNS and other anatomic structures, such as the smooth muscles of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the urinary bladder. Morphine is somewhat selective to the μ opioid receptor but has
some affinity for the κ and δ receptors. Morphine also inhibits the release of many excitatory transmitters from nerve
terminals carrying nociceptive (painful) stimuli. Some therapeutic uses of morphine and other opioids are listed in
Figure 14.6.
Figure 14.6 Selected clinical uses of opioids.
2.  Actions
a.  Analgesia
Morphine and other opioids relieve pain by raising the pain threshold at the spinal cord level and by altering the
brain’s perception of pain. The maximum analgesic efficacy for representative opioid agonists is shown in Figure
14.7.
552
Figure 14.7 A comparison of opioid agonist efficacy.
b.  Euphoria
Morphine produces a powerful sense of contentment and well-being. Euphoria may be caused by disinhibition of the
dopamine-containing neurons of the ventral tegmental area.
c.  Respiration
Morphine causes respiratory depression by reduction of the responsiveness of medullary respiratory center neurons
to carbon dioxide. This can occur with ordinary doses of morphine in patients who are opioid naïve and can be
accentuated as the dose is increased, until ultimately respiration ceases. Respiratory depression is the most common
cause of death in acute opioid overdoses. Tolerance to this effect develops with repeated dosing, which allows for
the safer use of morphine for the treatment of pain when the dose is correctly titrated.
d.  Depression of cough reflex
Both morphine and codeine have antitussive properties. In general, cough suppression does not correlate closely
with analgesic and respiratory depressant properties of opioid drugs. The receptors involved in the antitussive action
appear to be different from those involved in analgesia.
e.  Miosis
The pinpoint pupil (Figure 14.8) characteristic of morphine use results from stimulation of μ and κ receptors. There
is little tolerance to this effect. [Note: This is important diagnostically, because many other causes of coma and
respiratory depression produce dilation of the pupil.]
553
Figure 14.8 Characteristic pinpoint pupil associated with morphine use.
f.  Emesis
Morphine directly stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema that causes vomiting.
g.  GI tract
Morphine relieves diarrhea by decreasing the motility and increasing the tone of the intestinal circular smooth
muscle. Morphine also increases the tone of the anal sphincter. Morphine and other opioids produce constipation,
with little tolerance developing. Morphine can also increase biliary tract pressure due to contraction of the
gallbladder and constriction of the biliary sphincter.
h.  Cardiovascular
Morphine has no major effects on blood pressure or heart rate at lower dosages, but hypotension and bradycardia
may occur at higher doses. Because of respiratory depression and carbon dioxide retention, cerebral vessels dilate
and increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Morphine is usually contraindicated in individuals with head trauma or
severe brain injury.
i.  Histamine release
Morphine releases histamine from mast cells causing urticaria, sweating, and vasodilation. Because it can cause
bronchoconstriction, morphine should be used with caution in patients with asthma.
j.  Hormonal actions
Prolonged use of morphine may lead to opioid-induced androgen deficiency due to suppression of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPA). This results in decreased production of sex hormones, especially
testosterone, resulting in many clinical symptoms (Figure 14.9).
554
555
Figure 14.9 Clinical symptoms associated with opioid-induced androgen deficiency
(OPIAD).
k.  Labor
Morphine may prolong the second stage of labor by transiently decreasing the strength, duration, and frequency of
uterine contractions.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
a.  Administration
Morphine has a linear pharmacokinetic profile; however, absorption of morphine after oral administration is slow
and erratic. Extended-release oral preparations provide more consistent plasma levels. Because significant first-pass
metabolism of morphine occurs in the liver, subcutaneous and intravenous (IV) injections produce the most reliable
response.
b.  Distribution
Morphine rapidly enters all body tissues, including the fetuses of pregnant women. It should not be used for
analgesia during labor. Infants born to addicted mothers show physical dependence on opioids and exhibit
withdrawal symptoms if opioids are not administered. Only a small percentage of morphine crosses the blood–brain
barrier, because morphine is the least lipophilic of the common opioids. By contrast, the more lipid-soluble opioids,
such as fentanyl and methadone, readily penetrate the CNS.
c.  Fate
Morphine is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver to two active metabolites (morphine-6-glucuronide [M6G]
and morphine-3-glucuronide [M3G]), which are renally excreted. M6G is a very potent analgesic. M3G does not
have analgesic activity but is believed to cause neuroexcitatory effects. The duration of action of morphine is 4 to 5
hours when administered systemically to opioid-naïve individuals but considerably longer when injected epidurally
because the low lipophilicity prevents redistribution from the epidural space.
4.  Adverse effects
Many adverse effects are common across the entire opioid class (Figure 14.10). With most mu agonists, severe
respiratory depression can occur and may result in death from acute opioid overdose. Respiratory drive may be
suppressed in patients with respiratory disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, emphysema, or cor pulmonale, so
close monitoring is necessary when using opioids. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a common adverse effect.
Initial management includes a nonprescription stimulant laxative such as senna. Peripherally acting μ-opioid
receptor antagonists such as methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, and naldemedine are prescription drugs available for the
treatment of OIC. [Note: Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that is indicated for OIC and irritable bowel
syndrome; see Chapter 40.] Morphine should be used with caution in patients with liver disease and renal
dysfunction.
556
557
Figure 14.10 Adverse effects commonly observed in individuals treated with opioids.
5.  Tolerance and physical dependence
Repeated use produces tolerance to the respiratory depressant, analgesic, euphoric, emetic, and sedative effects of
morphine. Tolerance usually does not develop to miosis (constriction of the pupils) or constipation. Physical and
psychological dependence can occur with morphine and other agonists. Withdrawal produces a series of autonomic,
motor, and psychological responses that can be severe, although it is rare that withdrawal effects cause death.
6.  Drug interactions
Drug interactions with morphine are possible. The depressant actions of morphine are enhanced by coadministration
with CNS depressant medications such as phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and
benzodiazepines. Guidelines for opioid prescribing urge clinicians to avoid simultaneous prescribing of opioids and
benzodiazepines. A black box warning also has been included on the labeling of both opioids and benzodiazepines
to alert prescribers of this dangerous combination.
558
B.  Codeine
Codeine [KOE-deen] is a naturally occurring opioid and a weak analgesic compared to morphine. It is used for mild
to moderate pain. The analgesic actions of codeine are derived from its conversion to morphine by the CYP2D6
enzyme (see Chapter 1). CYP2D6 activity varies among patients, and ultrarapid metabolizers may experience higher
levels of morphine, leading to possible overdose and toxicity. Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have
been reported in children who received codeine, mostly following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Codeine is
commonly used in combination with acetaminophen for management of pain. The drug exhibits good antitussive
activity at doses that do not cause analgesia. Dextromethorphan [dex-troe-meth-OR-fan] is a synthetic cough
depressant that has relatively no analgesic action and much lower potential for abuse in usual antitussive doses. It is
preferred over codeine in most situations where cough suppression is needed.
559
C.  Oxycodone and oxymorphone
Oxymorphone [ox-ee-MOR-fone] and oxycodone [ok-see-KOE-done] are orally active, semisynthetic analogs of
morphine and codeine, respectively. Oxymorphone given parenterally is approximately ten times more potent than
morphine, but when administered orally, the potency drops to about three times that of morphine. Oxymorphone is
available in both immediate-release and extended-release oral formulations. This agent has no clinically relevant
drug interactions associated with the CYP450 enzyme system. Oxycodone is approximately two times more potent
than morphine and is available in an immediate-release formulation, alone or in combination with acetaminophen,
aspirin, or ibuprofen. An extended-release formulation is also available. Oxycodone is mainly metabolized via the
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.
560
D.  Hydromorphone and hydrocodone
Hydromorphone [hye-droe-MORE-fone] and hydrocodone [hye-droe-KOE-done] are orally active, semisynthetic
analogs of morphine and codeine, respectively. Oral hydromorphone is approximately 4 to 7 times more potent than
oral morphine. It is preferred over morphine in patients with renal dysfunction due to less accumulation of active
metabolites. Hydrocodone is the methyl ether derivative of hydromorphone, but is a weaker analgesic than
hydromorphone, with oral analgesic efficacy comparable to that of morphine. This agent is often combined with
acetaminophen or ibuprofen to treat moderate to severe pain. It is also used as an antitussive. Hydrocodone is
metabolized in the liver to several metabolites, one of which is hydromorphone via the actions of CYP2D6.
561
E.  Fentanyl
Fentanyl [FEN-ta-nil] is a synthetic opioid chemically related to meperidine. Fentanyl has 100-fold the analgesic
potency of morphine and is used for anesthesia and acute pain management. The drug is highly lipophilic and has a
rapid onset and short duration of action (15 to 30 minutes). It is usually administered IV, epidurally, or intrathecally.
Fentanyl is combined with local anesthetics to provide epidural analgesia for labor and postoperative pain. IV
fentanyl is used in anesthesia for its analgesic and sedative effects. Many fast-acting transmucosal and nasal fentanyl
products are available for cancer-related breakthrough pain in opioid-tolerant patients. The transdermal patch creates
a reservoir of the drug in the skin and has a delayed onset of at least 12 hours and a prolonged offset. The patch is
used for management of chronic severe pain. It is contraindicated in opioid-naïve patients and should not be used in
management of acute or postoperative pain. Fentanyl is metabolized to inactive metabolites by CYP3A4, and drugs
that inhibit this isoenzyme can potentiate the effect of fentanyl.
562
F.  Sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil
Sufentanil [soo-FEN-ta-nil], alfentanil [al-FEN-ta-nil], remifentanil [rem-ih-FEN-ta-nil], and carfentanil [car-FEN-
ta-nil] are synthetic opioid agonists related to fentanyl. These agents differ in potency and metabolic disposition.
Sufentanil and carfentanil are even more potent than fentanyl, whereas the other two are less potent and shorter
acting. Sufentanil, alfentanil, and remifentanil are mainly used for their analgesic and sedative properties during
surgical procedures requiring anesthesia. Carfentanil is about 100 times more potent than fentanyl. The drug is not
used in clinical practice; however, it is of toxicological interest as it is used to lace heroin and has contributed to
several opioid-related deaths.
563
G.  Methadone
Methadone [METH-a-done] is a synthetic, orally effective opioid that has variable equianalgesic potency compared
to that of morphine, and the conversion between the two products is not linear. Methadone is a μ agonist, an
antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Therefore, it is useful in the treatment of both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Methadone may also be used for
opioid withdrawal and maintenance therapy in the setting of prescription opioid and heroin abuse. The withdrawal
syndrome with methadone is milder but more protracted (days to weeks) than that with other opioids. Methadone
induces less euphoria and has a longer duration of action than morphine. Unlike morphine, methadone is well
absorbed after oral administration. Methadone is also constipating, but less so than morphine.
Understanding the pharmacokinetics of methadone is important to ensure proper use. After oral administration,
methadone is biotransformed in the liver and excreted almost exclusively in the feces. Methadone is very lipophilic,
rapidly distributed throughout the body, and released slowly during redistribution and elimination. This translates
into a long half-life ranging from 12 to 40 hours, although it may extend up to 150 hours. Despite the extended half-
life, the actual duration of analgesia ranges from 4 to 8 hours. Attainment of steady state can vary dramatically,
ranging from 35 hours to 2 weeks, so dosage adjustments should occur only every 5 to 7 days. Upon repeated
dosing, methadone can accumulate due to the long terminal half-life, leading to toxicity. Overdose is possible when
prescribers are unaware of the long half-life, the incomplete cross-tolerance between methadone and other opioids,
and the titration guidelines to avoid toxic accumulation. The metabolism is variable due to involvement of multiple
CYP450 isoenzymes, some of which are affected by known genetic polymorphisms. As such, methadone is
susceptible to many drug–drug interactions.
Methadone can produce physical dependence like that of morphine, but it has less neurotoxicity than morphine
due to lack of active metabolites. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and cause torsades de pointes, possibly by
interacting with cardiac potassium channels. Baseline and routine ECG monitoring is recommended.
564
H.  Meperidine
Meperidine [me-PER-i-deen] is a lower-potency synthetic opioid structurally unrelated to morphine. It is used for
acute pain and acts primarily as a κ agonist, with some μ agonist activity. Meperidine is very lipophilic and has
anticholinergic effects, resulting in an increased incidence of delirium compared with other opioids. Meperidine has
an active metabolite (normeperidine), which is potentially neurotoxic. Normeperidine is renally excreted, and in
patients with renal insufficiency, accumulation of the metabolite may lead to delirium, hyperreflexia, myoclonus,
and seizures. Due to the short duration of action and the potential for toxicity, meperidine should only be used for
short-term (≤48 hours) management of pain. Meperidine should not be used in elderly patients or those with renal
insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, preexisting respiratory compromise, or concomitant or recent administration of
MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients receiving both meperidine and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
565
IV.  Partial Agonists and Mixed Agonist–Antagonists
Partial agonists bind to the opioid receptor, but they have less intrinsic activity than full agonists (see Chapter 2).
There is a ceiling to the pharmacologic effects of these agents. Drugs that stimulate one receptor but block another
are termed mixed agonist–antagonists. The effects of these drugs depend on previous exposure to opioids. In
individuals who are opioid-naïve, mixed agonist–antagonists show agonist activity and are used to relieve pain. In
the presence of a full agonist, the agonist–antagonist drugs may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms.
566
A.  Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine [byoo-pre-NOR-feen] acts as a potent partial agonist at the μ receptor and an antagonist at the κ
receptors. Buprenorphine is very lipophilic and has a longer duration of action due to its high affinity for the opioid
receptors when compared to morphine. Due to high affinity for the mu receptor, buprenorphine can displace full μ
agonists, leading to withdrawal symptoms in an opioid-dependent patient. Because of the partial μ agonist activity,
buprenorphine provides a “ceiling effect,” causing less euphoric effects and a lower abuse potential than that of full
agonists. Additionally, the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression may be lower when compared with full
agonists, except when combined with CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines. Buprenorphine is available in
sublingual, transmucosal, buccal, parenteral, subdermal, and transdermal formulations. The drug is approved for
moderate to severe pain. Certain formulations (for example, sublingual and subdermal) are approved for use in
medication-assisted treatment of opioid addiction due to its ability to provide prolonged suppression of opioid
withdrawal, the ability to block other μ agonists, and less frequent dosing requirements. In contrast to methadone,
which is available only at specialized clinics when used for opioid detoxification or maintenance, buprenorphine is
approved for office-based treatment of opioid dependence. It has been shown to have shorter and less severe
withdrawal symptoms compared to methadone (Figure 14.11). Adverse effects include respiratory depression that
cannot easily be reversed by naloxone and decreased (or, rarely, increased) blood pressure, nausea, and dizziness.
Additionally, buprenorphine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Although the clinical
significance of this effect is controversial, current labeling for some buprenorphine products includes dosing
restrictions due to the concern of QTc prolongation. Risk factors to evaluate when considering buprenorphine
include cardiovascular factors and concurrent drugs that may prolong.
Figure 14.11 Severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms after abrupt withdrawal of
equivalent doses of heroin, buprenorphine, and methadone.

568
B.  Pentazocine
Pentazocine [pen-TAZ-oh-seen] acts as an agonist on κ receptors and is a weak antagonist or partial agonist at μ
receptors. It can be administered either orally or parenterally. Pentazocine produces less euphoria compared to
morphine, but in higher doses, respiratory depression, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, and hallucinations can
occur. For these reasons, pentazocine is rarely used for management of pain. Despite its antagonist action,
pentazocine does not antagonize the respiratory depression of morphine, but it can precipitate withdrawal effects in a
morphine user. Pentazocine should be used with caution in patients with angina or coronary artery disease, since it
can increase blood pressure.
569
C.  Nalbuphine and butorphanol
Nalbuphine [NAL-byoo-feen] and butorphanol [byoo-TOR-fa-nole] are mixed opioid agonist–antagonists. Like
pentazocine, they play a limited role in the treatment of chronic pain. Butorphanol is available in a nasal spray that
has been used for severe headaches, but it has been associated with abuse. Both products are available in an
injectable formulation. Their propensity to cause psychotomimetic effects is less than that of pentazocine. In contrast
to pentazocine and butorphanol, nalbuphine does not affect the heart or increase blood pressure. A benefit of all
three medications is that they exhibit a ceiling effect for respiratory depression.
570
V.  Other Analgesics
571
A.  Tapentadol
Tapentadol [ta-PEN-ta-dol], a centrally acting analgesic, is an agonist at the μ opioid receptor and an inhibitor of
norepinephrine reuptake. It is used to manage moderate to severe acute and chronic pain, including neuropathic pain
associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Tapentadol is mainly metabolized to inactive metabolites via
glucuronidation, and it does not inhibit or induce the CYP450 enzyme system. Because tapentadol does not produce
active metabolites, dosing adjustment is not necessary in mild to moderate renal impairment. Tapentadol should be
avoided in patients who have received MAOIs within the past 14 days. It is available in an immediate-release and
extended-release formulation.
572
B.  Tramadol
Tramadol [TRA-ma-dole] is a centrally acting analgesic that binds to the μ opioid receptor. It undergoes extensive
metabolism via CYP2D6, leading to an active metabolite, which has a much higher affinity for the mu receptor than
the parent compound. In addition, it weakly inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. It is used to manage
moderate to severe pain. Of note, tramadol has less respiratory-depressant activity compared to morphine.
Administration of naloxone can only partially reverse tramadol toxicity and has been associated with an increased
risk of seizures. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Overdose or drug–drug interactions with SSRIs,
MAOIs, and tricyclic antidepressants can lead to toxicity manifested by CNS excitation and seizures. Tramadol
should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures. As with other agents that bind the μ opioid
receptor, tramadol has been associated with misuse and abuse.
573
VI.  Antagonists
The opioid antagonists bind with high affinity to opioid receptors, but they fail to activate the receptor-mediated
response. Administration of opioid antagonists produces no profound effects in individuals not taking opioids. In
opioid-dependent patients, antagonists rapidly reverse the effect of agonists, such as morphine or any full μ agonist,
and precipitate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Figure 14.12 summarizes some signs and symptoms of opioid
withdrawal.
Figure 14.12 Opiate withdrawal syndrome. GI = gastrointestinal.
574
A.  Naloxone
Naloxone [nal-OX-own] is a competitive antagonist at μ, κ, and δ receptors, with a 10-fold higher affinity for mu
than for kappa receptors. It rapidly displaces all receptor-bound opioid molecules and, therefore, can reverse the
effects of morphine overdose, such as respiratory depression and coma within 1 to 2 minutes of IV administration.
Naloxone can also be administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intranasally, with a slightly longer onset of
2 to 5 minutes; however, little to no clinical effect is seen with oral naloxone due to extensive first-pass metabolism.
Since naloxone has a half-life of 30 to 81 minutes, a patient who has been treated for an overdose and recovered
may lapse back into respiratory depression, depending on the opioid ingested and dosage form of that opioid. [Note:
Much higher doses and continuous administration of naloxone are needed to reverse the effects of buprenorphine
due to its high affinity for the mu receptor.]
Naloxone is available in an autoinjector and a nasal inhaler for community distribution for treatment of opioid
overdose involving heroin or prescription opioids. It is imperative that prescribers counsel the patient and family
members regarding the availability of these products, proper instructions for use, and the importance of calling
emergency services in the case of overdose.
575
B.  Naltrexone
Naltrexone [nal-TREX-own] has actions similar to those of naloxone, but it has a longer duration of action and can
be given orally. For example, a single oral dose of naltrexone blocks the effect of injected heroin for up to 24 hours,
and the intramuscular formulation blocks the effect for 30 days. Naltrexone in combination with clonidine (and,
sometimes, with buprenorphine) is used for rapid opioid detoxification. Naltrexone has been reported to cause
hepatotoxicity and monitoring of hepatic function is recommended.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the agents listed is a phenanthrene opioid that exhibits a full and immediate response to treatment
with naloxone in the case of overdose?
A.  Meperidine
B.  Morphine
C.  Buprenorphine
D.  Fentanyl
Correct answer = B. A morphine overdose can be effectively treated with naloxone, and morphine is a
phenanthrene. Naloxone antagonizes the opioid by displacing it from the receptor, but there are cases in which
naloxone is not effective. Meperidine is a phenylpiperidine, not a phenanthrene, and the active metabolite,
normeperidine, is not reversible by naloxone. The effects of buprenorphine are only partially reversible by
naloxone. In most cases of buprenorphine overdose, the dose of naloxone needs to be high and continuous due to
the higher binding affinity to the mu receptor. Naloxone is effective for fentanyl overdoses; however, fentanyl is a
phenylpiperidine, and not a phenanthrene.
A 76-year-old female with renal insufficiency has severe pain secondary to a compression fracture in the
lumbar spine. She reports that the pain has been uncontrolled with tramadol, and it is decided to start
treatment with an opioid. Which is the best opioid for this patient?
A.  Meperidine
B.  Fentanyl transdermal patch
C.  Hydrocodone/acetaminophen
D.  Morphine
Correct answer = C. Hydrocodone/acetaminophen is the best choice. It is very important to use a low dose and
monitor closely for proper pain control and adverse effects. Meperidine should not be used for chronic pain, nor
should it be used in a patient with renal insufficiency. The transdermal patch is not a good option, since her pain
is considered acute and she is opioid naïve. Morphine is not the best choice due to the active metabolites that can
accumulate in renal insufficiency.
Which statement about buprenorphine is correct?
A.  Buprenorphine has a much higher incidence of opioid-induced respiratory depression compared to other μ
agonists.
B.  Buprenorphine has many dosage formulations, and all formulations can be prescribed for the treatment of pain or
opioid dependence.
C.  Buprenorphine has a lower number of drug–drug interactions compared to methadone.
D.  Buprenorphine is a full μ agonist, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, and a norepinephrine and serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.
Correct answer = C. Buprenorphine is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system, so there are concerns about drug
interactions; however, compared to methadone, which is metabolized by numerous CYP450 enzymes, the drug
interaction concern for buprenorphine is much lower. Buprenorphine has a lower incidence of opioid-induced
respiratory depression compared to the μ agonists due to the ceiling effect created by the partial μ agonist activity.
Buprenorphine is available in many different dosage formulations, but these formulations are indicated for either
pain management or medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence, not both. Option D describes the
mechanism of action of methadone. Buprenorphine is a potent partial μ agonist and a κ antagonist.
A 56-year-old patient has suffered with painful diabetic neuropathy and severe chronic back pain with
radiculopathy secondary to spinal stenosis for many years. This patient has failed to receive relief from his
neuropathic pain with first-line agents such as tricyclics, SNRIs, or anticonvulsants. Based on the mechanism
of action, which opioid could be considered in this patient to treat both nociceptive and neuropathic pain?
A.  Meperidine
B.  Oxymorphone
C.  Morphine
D.  Tapentadol
Correct answer = D. Tapentadol has a unique mechanism of action in comparison with the other choices given.
Tapentadol has a dual mechanism of action (μ agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition), which has been
shown to effectively treat neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. All other μ agonists
could help manage neuropathic pain, but in some situations, higher doses of opioids are needed to achieve
efficacy.
Which of the following statements regarding methadone is correct?
A.  Methadone is an excellent choice for analgesia in most patients because there are limited drug–drug interactions.
B.  The equianalgesic potency of methadone is similar to that of morphine.
C.  The duration of analgesia for methadone is much shorter than the elimination half-life.
577
14.6
14.7
14.8
14.9
14.10
D.  The active metabolites of methadone accumulate in patients with renal dysfunction.
Correct Answer = C. The duration of analgesia is much shorter than the elimination half-life, leading to dangers
of accumulation and increased potential for respiratory depression and death. The equianalgesic potency of
methadone is extremely variable based on many factors, and only providers familiar with methadone should
prescribe this agent. The drug interactions associated with methadone are numerous due to the multiple liver
enzymes that metabolize the drug. Methadone does not have active metabolites, which makes it a treatment
option in patients with renal dysfunction.
AN is a 57-year-old man who has been treated with oxycodone for chronic nonmalignant pain for over 2
years. He now reports increased pain in the afternoon while at work. Which of the following is a short-acting
opioid and is the best choice for this patient’s breakthrough pain?
A.  Methadone
B.  Fentanyl
C.  Hydrocodone
D.  Nalbuphine
Correct answer = C. Hydrocodone is a commonly used short-acting agent that is commercially available in
combination with either acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Methadone should not routinely be used for breakthrough
pain due to the unique pharmacokinetics and should be reserved for practitioners who have experience with this
agent and understand the variables associated with this drug. Fentanyl is available in formulations for treatment of
breakthrough pain for cancer treatment. It is not appropriate to use fentanyl in this type of chronic pain setting.
Nalbuphine is a mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic that could precipitate withdrawal in patients who are currently
taking a full μ agonist such as oxycodone.
A 64-year-old man is preparing for a total knee replacement. He is taking many medications that are
metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system and is worried about drug interactions with the pain medication
that will be used following surgery. Which of the following opioids would have the lowest chance of drug
interactions in this patient?
A.  Methadone
B.  Tapentadol
C.  Tramadol
D.  Oxycodone
Correct answer = B. Tapentadol is metabolized via glucuronidation and has not been shown to have any clinically
relevant drug interactions associated with the CYP450 enzyme family. All other opioids listed are metabolized by
one or more CYP450 enzymes and increase the risk of drug interactions.
Which of the following statements regarding adverse effects of opioid therapy is correct?
A.  The risk of respiratory depression is highest during an initial opioid initiation or following a dose increase.
B.  Opioid-induced constipation is only seen with the initiation of opioid therapy.
C.  The incidence of nausea and sedation increases with long-term use of opioid therapy.
D.  Decreased testosterone levels are commonly seen with short-term use of opioid therapy.
Correct answer = A. The risk of respiratory depression is highest when the opioid is first initiated or a dosage is
raised (or sometimes a drug–drug interaction leads to higher opioid levels). Opioid-induced constipation can
occur at any time during the therapy, and a patient does not develop a tolerance to this side effect. Side effects
such as nausea and sedation commonly decrease after repeated dosing due to development of tolerance to these
adverse effects. Chronic opioid exposure has been linked to decreased testosterone levels in males.
KM is a 64-year-old man who has been hospitalized following a car accident in which he sustained a broken
leg and broken arm. He has been converted to oral morphine in anticipation of discharge from the hospital.
Upon discharge, which medication should he receive along with the morphine?
A.  Diphenhydramine
B.  Methylphenidate
C.  Senna
D.  Docusate sodium
Correct answer = C. A bowel regimen should be prescribed with the initiation of the opioid since constipation is
very common and can occur at any time, and tolerance to this adverse effect does not occur. Senna is a stimulant
that is available over-the-counter. Docusate sodium is a stool softener that is ineffective in opioid-induced
constipation when used as a single agent. Combination products that include both docusate and senna are
commonly used and can be effective, mainly due to the actions of senna. Diphenhydramine can be used for
urticaria that might occur with the initiation of an opioid, and methylphenidate has been used for opioid-induced
sedation in certain situations, but these issues are not reported in this case.
AN is a 67-year-old man who has been treated with oxycodone for chronic nonmalignant pain with no
changes in the dosing regimen for over 2 years. His pain has been fairly well controlled, and he remains
active, reports satisfaction with his pain regimen, and denies any side effects. He has been recently diagnosed
578
with COPD and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Which of the following options is the best treatment
recommendation for him at this time?
A.  Taper off all opioids due to increased risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression.
B.  Prescribe naloxone nasal spray to have at home in case he experiences an opioid overdose.
C.  Prescribe oral naloxone tablets to have at home in case he experiences an opioid overdose.
D.  No action is needed at this time. His pain is well controlled, and he is reporting no side effects.
Correct answer = B. Because this patient has just been diagnosed with COPD and OSA, it is clear his risk for
opioid-induced respiratory depression is greater. Since the pain is controlled and no side effects are reported,
tapering off the opioids at this time is not the best answer. Because of the first-pass effect, naloxone is not
clinically effective for management of an overdose when given orally. Therefore, the nasal spray is the best
choice. Offering the at-home naloxone nasal spray, along with proper education, might be lifesaving if an
overdose occurs. Providing proper education to the patient and caregivers on the importance of having the
naloxone nasal spray at home and of calling emergency services is critical in case of an overdose situation.

CNS Stimulants
Jose A. Rey
580
I.  Overview
Psychomotor stimulants and hallucinogens are two groups of drugs that act primarily to stimulate the central
nervous system (CNS). The psychomotor stimulants cause excitement and euphoria, decrease feelings of fatigue,
and increase motor activity. The hallucinogens produce profound changes in thought patterns and mood, with little
effect on the brainstem and spinal cord. As a group, the CNS stimulants have diverse clinical uses and are also
potential drugs of abuse, as are the CNS depressants (Chapter 9) and the opioids (Chapter 14). Figure 15.1
summarizes the CNS stimulants.
Figure 15.1 Summary of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants.
581
II.  Psychomotor Stimulants
582
A.  Methylxanthines
The methylxanthines include theophylline [thee-OFF-i-lin], which is found in tea; theobromine [thee-oh-BROE-
meen], which is found in cocoa; and caffeine [kaf-EEN]. Caffeine, the most widely consumed stimulant in the world,
is found in highest concentration in certain coffee products (for example, espresso), but it is also present in tea, cola
drinks, energy drinks, chocolate candy, and cocoa.
1.  Mechanism of action
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the actions of methylxanthines, including translocation of extracellular
calcium, increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate caused by inhibition of
phosphodiesterase, and blockade of adenosine receptors.
2.  Actions
a.  CNS
The caffeine contained in one to two cups of coffee (100 to 200 mg) causes a decrease in fatigue and increased
mental alertness as a result of stimulating the cortex and other areas of the brain. Consumption of 1.5 g of caffeine
(12 to 15 cups of coffee) produces anxiety and tremors. The spinal cord is stimulated only by very high doses (2 to 5
g) of caffeine. Tolerance can rapidly develop to the stimulating properties of caffeine, and withdrawal consists of
feelings of fatigue and sedation.
b.  Cardiovascular system
A high dose of caffeine has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart. [Note: Increased contractility
can be harmful to patients with angina pectoris. In others, an accelerated heart rate can trigger premature ventricular
contractions.]
c.  Diuretic action
Caffeine has a mild diuretic action that increases urinary output of sodium, chloride, and potassium.
d.  Gastric mucosa
Because methylxanthines stimulate secretion of gastric acid, individuals with peptic ulcers should avoid foods and
beverages containing methylxanthines.
3.  Therapeutic uses
Caffeine and its derivatives relax the smooth muscles of the bronchioles. Theophylline has been largely replaced by
other agents, such as β2 agonists and corticosteroids, for the treatment of asthma (see Chapter 39). Caffeine is also
used in combination with the analgesics acetaminophen and aspirin for the management of headaches in both
prescription and over-the-counter products.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
The methylxanthines are well absorbed orally. Caffeine distributes throughout the body, including the brain. These
drugs cross the placenta to the fetus and are secreted into the breast milk. All methylxanthines are metabolized in the
liver, generally by the CYP1A2 pathway, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine.
5.  Adverse effects
Moderate doses of caffeine cause insomnia, anxiety, and agitation. A high dosage is required for toxicity, which is
manifested by emesis and convulsions. The lethal dose is 10 g of caffeine (about 100 cups of coffee), which induces
cardiac arrhythmias. Lethargy, irritability, and headache occur in users who routinely consume more than 600 mg of
caffeine per day (roughly six cups of coffee per day) and then suddenly stop.
583
B.  Nicotine
Nicotine [NIK-o-teen] is the active ingredient in tobacco. Although this drug is not currently used therapeutically
(except in smoking cessation therapy), nicotine remains important because it is second only to caffeine as the most
widely used CNS stimulant, and it is second only to alcohol as the most abused drug. In combination with the tars
and carbon monoxide found in cigarette smoke, nicotine represents a serious risk factor for lung and cardiovascular
disease, and other illnesses.
1.  Mechanism of action
In low doses, nicotine causes ganglionic stimulation by depolarization. At high doses, nicotine causes ganglionic
blockade. Nicotine receptors exist at a number of sites in the CNS, which participate in the stimulant attributes of the
drug.
2.  Actions
a.  CNS
Nicotine is highly lipid soluble and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Cigarette smoking or administration of
low doses of nicotine produces some degree of euphoria and arousal, as well as relaxation. It improves attention,
learning, problem solving, and reaction time. High doses of nicotine result in central respiratory paralysis and severe
hypotension caused by medullary paralysis (Figure 15.2). Nicotine is also an appetite suppressant.
Figure 15.2 Actions of nicotine on the CNS.
b.  Peripheral effects
The peripheral effects of nicotine are complex. Stimulation of sympathetic ganglia as well as of the adrenal medulla
increases blood pressure and heart rate. Thus, use of tobacco is particularly harmful in hypertensive patients. Many
patients with peripheral vascular disease experience an exacerbation of symptoms with smoking. In addition,
nicotine-induced vasoconstriction can decrease coronary blood flow, adversely affecting a patient with angina.
Stimulation of parasympathetic ganglia also increases motor activity of the bowel. At higher doses, blood pressure
falls and activity ceases in both the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and bladder musculature as a result of a nicotine-
induced block of parasympathetic ganglia.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Because nicotine is highly lipid soluble, absorption readily occurs via the oral mucosa, lungs, GI mucosa, and skin.
Nicotine crosses the placental membrane and is secreted in the breast milk. By inhaling tobacco smoke, the average
smoker takes in 1 to 2 mg of nicotine per cigarette. The acute lethal dose is 60 mg. More than 90% of the nicotine
inhaled in smoke is absorbed. Clearance of nicotine involves metabolism in the lung and the liver and urinary
584
excretion. Tolerance to the toxic effects of nicotine develops rapidly, often within days.
4.  Adverse effects
The CNS effects of nicotine include irritability and tremors. Nicotine may also cause intestinal cramps, diarrhea, and
increased heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the rate of metabolism for a number
of drugs.
5.  Withdrawal syndrome
As with the other drugs in this class, nicotine is an addictive substance, and physical dependence develops rapidly
and can be severe (Figure 15.3). Withdrawal is characterized by irritability, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty
concentrating, headaches, and insomnia. Appetite is affected, and GI upset often occurs. The transdermal patch and
chewing gum containing nicotine have been shown to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and to help smokers
stop smoking. For example, the blood concentration of nicotine obtained from nicotine chewing gum is typically
about one-half the peak level observed with smoking (Figure 15.4). Other forms of nicotine replacement used for
smoking cessation include the inhaler, nasal spray, and lozenges. Bupropion, an antidepressant (Chapter 10), can
reduce the craving for cigarettes, assist in smoking cessation, and attenuate symptoms of withdrawal.
585
Figure 15.3 Nicotine has potential for addiction and withdrawal.
586
Figure 15.4 Blood concentrations of nicotine in individuals who smoked cigarettes,
chewed nicotine gum, or received nicotine by transdermal patch.
587
C.  Varenicline
Varenicline [ver-EN-ih-kleen] is a partial agonist at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the CNS. Because
varenicline is only a partial agonist at these receptors, it produces less euphoric effects than nicotine (nicotine is a
full agonist). Thus, it is useful as an adjunct in the management of smoking cessation in patients with nicotine
withdrawal symptoms. Patients taking varenicline should be monitored for suicidal thoughts, vivid nightmares, and
mood changes.
588
D.  Cocaine
Cocaine [koe-KANE] is a widely available and highly addictive drug. Because of its abuse potential, cocaine is
classified as a Schedule II drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. The primary mechanism of action
underlying the effects of cocaine is blockade of reuptake of the monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin, and
dopamine) into the presynaptic terminals. This potentiates and prolongs the CNS and peripheral actions of these
monoamines. In particular, the prolongation of dopaminergic effects in the brain’s pleasure system (limbic system)
produces the intense euphoria that cocaine initially causes. Chronic intake of cocaine depletes dopamine. This
depletion triggers craving for cocaine (Figure 15.5). A full description of cocaine and its effects is provided in
Chapter 45.
Figure 15.5 Cocaine and amphetamine have potential for addiction.
589
E.  Amphetamine
Amphetamine [am-FET-a-meen] is a sympathetic amine that shows neurologic and clinical effects similar to those of
cocaine. Dextroamphetamine [dex-troe-am-FET-a-meen] is the major member of this class of compounds.
Methamphetamine [meth-am-FET-a-meen] (also known as “speed”) is a derivative of amphetamine available for
prescription use. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (also known as MDMA, or ecstasy) is a synthetic derivative
of methamphetamine with both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties (see Chapter 45).
1.  Mechanism of action
As with cocaine, the effects of amphetamine on the CNS and peripheral nervous system are indirect. That is, both
depend upon an elevation of the level of catecholamine neurotransmitters in synaptic spaces. Amphetamine,
however, achieves this effect by releasing intracellular stores of catecholamines (Figure 15.6). Because
amphetamine also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is a weak reuptake transport inhibitor, high levels of
catecholamines are present in synaptic spaces. Despite different mechanisms of action, the behavioral effects of
amphetamine and its derivatives are similar to those of cocaine.
590
591
Figure 15.6 Mechanism of action of amphetamine.
2.  Actions
a.  CNS
The major behavioral effects of amphetamine result from a combination of its dopamine and norepinephrine
release–enhancing properties. Amphetamine stimulates the entire cerebrospinal axis, cortex, brainstem, and medulla.
This leads to increased alertness, decreased fatigue, depressed appetite, and insomnia. The CNS stimulant effects of
amphetamine and its derivatives have led to their use in the treatment of hyperactivity in children, narcolepsy, and
obesity. At high doses, psychosis and convulsions may occur.
b.  Sympathetic nervous system
In addition to marked action on the CNS, amphetamine acts on the adrenergic system, indirectly stimulating the
receptors through norepinephrine release.
3.  Therapeutic uses
Factors that limit the therapeutic usefulness of amphetamine include psychological and physiologic dependence.
a.  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Some children are hyperkinetic and lack the ability to be involved in any activity for longer than a few minutes.
Dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, the mixed amphetamine salts, and methylphenidate [meth-ill-FEN-ih-date]
help improve attention span and alleviate many of the behavioral problems associated with this syndrome, in
addition to reducing hyperkinesia. Lisdexamfetamine [lis-dex-am-FET-a-meen] is a prodrug that is converted to L-
lysine and the active component dextroamphetamine through the hydrolytic actions of red blood cells. Atomoxetine
[AT-oh-MOX-ih-teen] is a nonstimulant drug approved for ADHD in children and adults. Unlike methylphenidate,
which blocks dopamine reuptake more than norepinephrine reuptake, atomoxetine is more selective for inhibition of
norepinephrine reuptake. Therefore, it is not considered habit forming and is not a controlled substance.
b.  Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a relatively rare sleep disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable bouts of sleepiness during the
day. The sleepiness can be treated with drugs, such as the mixed amphetamine salts or methylphenidate. Modafinil
[moe-DA-fi-nil] and its R-enantiomer derivative, armodafinil [ar-moe-DA-fi-nil], are considered first-line agents for
the treatment of narcolepsy. Modafinil promotes wakefulness, but it produces less psychoactive and euphoric effects
and fewer alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. The mechanism of
action remains unclear but may involve the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Modafinil is well distributed
throughout the body and undergoes elimination via hepatic metabolism and excretion in the urine. Headaches,
nausea, and nervousness are the primary adverse effects. Modafinil and armodafinil may have some potential for
abuse and physical dependence, and both are classified as controlled substances.
c.  Appetite suppression
Phentermine [FEN-ter-meen] and diethylpropion [dye-eth-ill-PROE-pee-on] are sympathomimetic amines that are
related structurally to amphetamine. These agents are used for appetite suppressant effects in the management of
obesity (see Chapter 37).
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Amphetamine is completely absorbed from the GI tract, metabolized by the liver, and excreted in the urine. [Note:
Administration of urinary alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate increase the nonionized species of the
drug and enhance the reabsorption of dextroamphetamine from the renal tubules into the bloodstream.]
Amphetamine abusers often administer the drug by IV injection and/or by smoking. The euphoria caused by
amphetamine lasts 4 to 6 hours, or four- to eightfold longer than the effects of cocaine.
5.  Adverse effects
The amphetamines may cause addiction, leading to dependence, tolerance, and drug-seeking behavior. In addition,
they have the following undesirable effects:
a.  CNS effects
Adverse effects of amphetamine usage include insomnia, irritability, weakness, dizziness, tremor, and hyperactive
reflexes (Figure 15.7). Amphetamine can also cause confusion, delirium, panic states, and suicidal tendencies,
especially in mentally ill patients. [Note: Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often used in the management of
agitation and CNS stimulation secondary to amphetamine overdose.] Chronic amphetamine use produces a state of
“amphetamine psychosis” that resembles the psychotic episodes associated with schizophrenia. Whereas long-term
amphetamine use is associated with psychological and physical dependence, tolerance to its effects may occur
within a few weeks. The anorectic effect of amphetamine is due to action in the lateral hypothalamic feeding center.
592
593
Figure 15.7 Adverse effects of amphetamines and methylphenidate.
b.  Cardiovascular effects
In addition to CNS effects, amphetamine may cause palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, anginal pain,
and circulatory collapse. Headache, chills, and excessive sweating may also occur.
c.  Gastrointestinal effects
Amphetamine acts on the GI system, causing anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.
d.  Contraindications
Patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of drug abuse or those
taking MAO inhibitors should not be treated with amphetamine.
594
F.  Methylphenidate
Methylphenidate has CNS stimulant properties similar to those of amphetamine and is often used in the treatment of
ADHD. Methylphenidate has abuse potential and is a Schedule II controlled substance. The pharmacologically
active isomer, dexmethylphenidate, is also a Schedule II drug used for the treatment of ADHD.
1.  Mechanism of action
Children with ADHD may produce weak dopamine signals, which suggest that once-interesting activities provide
fewer rewards to these children. Methylphenidate is a dopamine and norepinephrine transport inhibitor and may act
by increasing both dopamine and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Methylphenidate is used in the treatment of ADHD. It is also effective in the treatment of narcolepsy. Unlike
methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate is not indicated in the treatment of narcolepsy.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Both methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are readily absorbed after oral administration. Methylphenidate is
available in extended-release oral formulations and as a transdermal patch for once-daily application. The
deesterified product, ritalinic acid, is excreted in urine.
4.  Adverse effects
GI adverse effects are the most common and include abdominal pain and nausea. Other reactions include anorexia,
insomnia, nervousness, and fever. In patients with epilepsy, methylphenidate may increase seizure frequency. The
drug is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma. Methylphenidate can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin,
phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and the tricyclic antidepressants.
595
III.  Hallucinogens
A few drugs have, as their primary action, the ability to induce altered perceptual states reminiscent of dreams.
Many of these altered states are accompanied by visions of bright, colorful changes in the environment and by a
plasticity of constantly changing shapes and color. The individual under the influence of these drugs is incapable of
normal decision-making because the drug interferes with rational thought. These compounds are known as
hallucinogens, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (from marijuana) are examples of
agents in this class. These agents are discussed in detail in Chapter 45.

Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A young male was brought to the emergency room by the police due to severe agitation. Psychiatric
examination revealed that he had injected dextroamphetamine several times in the past few days. The last use
was 10 hours prior. He was given an intramuscular drug that sedated him, and he fell asleep. Which drug was
most likely used to counter this patient’s symptoms of dextroamphetamine withdrawal?
A.  Trazodone
B.  Lorazepam
C.  Cocaine
D.  Hydroxyzine
Correct answer = B. The anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, make them the drugs of
choice in treating the anxiety and agitation of amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Lorazepam also has hypnotic
properties. Trazodone has hypnotic properties, but its anxiolytic properties are inferior to those of the
benzodiazepines. Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is effective as a hypnotic, and it is sometimes used to deal with
anxiety, especially if emesis is a problem but it is rarely used in the emergency situation when rapid anxiolytic
and antiseizure treatment is warranted.
A 10-year-old boy is sent to a pediatric neurologist for an evaluation due to poor performance and inability
to pay attention in school. He has also been fighting with other children. He is given a diagnosis of ADHD
with impulsivity and irritability. Which is most appropriate for management of the ADHD?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Mirtazapine
C.  Dextroamphetamine
D.  Haloperidol
Correct answer = C. Dextroamphetamine is the only stimulant medication in the list that is approved for ADHD.
Symptoms like fighting may improve with haloperidol, and hyperactivity may improve with clonidine, but these
agents would not improve the patient’s academic performance and the underlying problems.
A 10-year-old boy with ADHD has symptoms that are controlled with an oral psychostimulant. However, he
and his family wish to avoid having to give a second dose of medication at school. They prefer an alternative
treatment that can be administered in the morning and last the entire day. Which treatment option is best?
A.  Mixed amphetamine salts in immediate-release oral tablet formulation
B.  Methylphenidate in a transdermal delivery system
C.  Nicotine in a chewing gum formulation for buccal absorption
D.  Methylphenidate in immediate-release pills
Correct answer = B. Methylphenidate is also a psychostimulant, and the transdermal (patch) formulation is
designed for once-daily use to avoid midday dosing. Immediate-release formulations require dosing at least twice
daily.
Which of the following agents for ADHD is a controlled substance (Schedule II)?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Atomoxetine
C.  Lisdexamfetamine
D.  Desipramine
Correct answer = C. Lisdexamfetamine is the only controlled substance on the list and is schedule II. The other
agents may assist in the management of ADHD but are not controlled substances.
Amphetamines may be used in patients with which of the following conditions?
A.  Cardiovascular disease
B.  Hypertension
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Obesity
Correct answer = D. The use of amphetamines in the management of obesity should be closely monitored.
Amphetamine analogs such as phentermine are approved for obesity. The other conditions are contraindications
when considering the use of amphetamines.
Which of the following agents is considered a first-line treatment for narcolepsy?
A.  Galantamine
B.  Atomoxetine
C.  Temazepam
D.  Modafinil
597
15.7
15.8
15.9
15.10
Correct answer = D. Modafinil is the only drug listed that is approved for narcolepsy. Temazepam is indicated for
insomnia, galantamine for Alzheimer’s disease, and atomoxetine for ADHD.
Which of the following is a common adverse effect of amphetamines?
A.  Bradycardia
B.  Somnolence
C.  Constipation
D.  Hypertension
Correct answer = D. Hypertension is a possible adverse effect that warrants caution, especially in individuals with
risk factors for increased blood pressure. Amphetamines cause tachycardia (not bradycardia), insomnia (not
somnolence), and diarrhea (not constipation).
Which of the following CNS stimulants occurs naturally and can be found in certain candies?
A.  Amphetamine
B.  Modafinil
C.  Caffeine
D.  Atomoxetine
Correct answer = C. Caffeine is a naturally occurring substance found in cocoa, chocolate, and many forms of tea.
Overuse of cola beverages and other caffeine-containing products may cause adverse effects, including anxiety
and insomnia, and even increase the risk for seizures.
A 35-year-old man is interested in quitting smoking. In previous quit attempts, he has tried nicotine gum, the
nicotine patch, and the “cold turkey” method. He has been unsuccessful in each of these attempts and
resumed smoking within 4 to 6 weeks. Which may be useful to assist in his attempt to quit smoking?
A.  Varenicline
B.  Dextroamphetamine
C.  Lorazepam
D.  Methylphenidate
Correct answer = A. Varenicline is approved as an adjunctive treatment option for the management of nicotine
dependence. It is believed to attenuate the withdrawal symptoms of smoking cessation, though monitoring is
needed for changes in psychiatric status, including suicidal ideation. The use of dextroamphetamine, lorazepam,
and methylphenidate bring the risk of addiction to another substance with abuse potential.
Which of the following agents carries the lowest risk for addiction?
A.  Armodafinil
B.  Lisdexamfetamine
C.  Dexmethylphenidate
D.  Varenicline
Correct answer = D. Varenicline is the only agent listed that is not a controlled substance. All of the other agents
are considered to have a risk for addiction and/or dependence.

I.  Overview
Blood pressure is elevated when systolic blood pressure exceeds 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure remains
below 80 mm Hg. Hypertension occurs when systolic blood pressure exceeds 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood
pressure exceeds 80 mm Hg on at least two occasions. Hypertension results from increased peripheral vascular
arteriolar smooth muscle tone, which leads to increased arteriolar resistance and reduced capacitance of the venous
system. In most cases, the cause of the increased vascular tone is unknown. Elevated blood pressure is a common
disorder, affecting approximately 30% of adults in the United States. Although many patients have no symptoms,
chronic hypertension can lead to heart disease and stroke, the top two causes of death in the world. Hypertension is
also an important risk factor in the development of chronic kidney disease and heart failure. The incidence of
morbidity and mortality significantly decreases when hypertension is diagnosed early and is properly treated. The
drugs used in the treatment of hypertension are shown in Figure 16.1. In recognition of the progressive nature of
hypertension, hypertension is classified into four categories (Figure 16.2). The majority of current guidelines
recommend treatment decisions based on goals of antihypertensive therapy, rather than the category of hypertension.

(Figure continues on next page)
602
Figure 16.2 Classification of blood pressure.
603
II.  Etiology of Hypertension
Although hypertension may occur secondary to other disease processes, more than 90% of patients have essential
hypertension (hypertension with no identifiable cause). A family history of hypertension increases the likelihood
that an individual will develop hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age but decreases with
education and income level. Non-Hispanic blacks have a higher incidence of hypertension than do both non-
Hispanic whites and Hispanic whites. Persons with diabetes, obesity, or disability status are all more likely to have
hypertension than those without these conditions. In addition, environmental factors, such as a stressful lifestyle,
high dietary intake of sodium, and smoking, may further predispose an individual to hypertension.
604
III.  Mechanisms for Controlling Blood Pressure
Arterial blood pressure is regulated within a narrow range to provide adequate perfusion of the tissues without
causing damage to the vascular system, particularly the arterial intima (endothelium). Arterial blood pressure is
directly proportional to cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance (Figure 16.3). Cardiac output and
peripheral resistance, in turn, are controlled mainly by two overlapping mechanisms: the baroreflexes and the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system (Figure 16.4). Most antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure by reducing
cardiac output and/or decreasing peripheral resistance.
Figure 16.3 Major factors influencing blood pressure.
605
Figure 16.4 Response of the autonomic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system to a decrease in blood pressure.
606
A.  Baroreceptors and the sympathetic nervous system
Baroreflexes act by changing the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, they
are responsible for the rapid, moment-to-moment regulation of blood pressure. A fall in blood pressure causes
pressure-sensitive neurons (baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses) to send fewer impulses to
cardiovascular centers in the spinal cord. This prompts a reflex response of increased sympathetic and decreased
parasympathetic output to the heart and vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output.
These changes result in a compensatory rise in blood pressure (Figure 16.4).
607
B.  Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
The kidney provides long-term control of blood pressure by altering the blood volume. Baroreceptors in the kidney
respond to reduced arterial pressure (and to sympathetic stimulation of β1-adrenoceptors) by releasing the enzyme
renin (Figure 16.4). Low-sodium intake and greater sodium loss also increase renin release. Renin converts
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted in turn to angiotensin II, in the presence of angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent circulating vasoconstrictor, constricting both arterioles and
veins, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II exerts a preferential vasoconstrictor action on the
efferent arterioles of the renal glomerulus, increasing glomerular filtration. Furthermore, angiotensin II stimulates
aldosterone secretion, leading to increased renal sodium reabsorption and increased blood volume, which contribute
to a further increase in blood pressure. These effects of angiotensin II are mediated by stimulation of angiotensin II
type 1 (AT1) receptors.
608
IV.  Treatment Strategies
The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. For most
patients, the blood pressure goal when treating hypertension is a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg and
a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. Current recommendations are to initiate therapy with a thiazide
diuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or calcium channel blocker. However, initial drug
therapy choice may vary depending on the guideline and concomitant diseases (Figure 16.5). If blood pressure is
inadequately controlled, a second drug should be added, with the selection based on minimizing the adverse effects
of the combined regimen and achieving goal blood pressure. Patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 20
mm Hg above goal or diastolic blood pressure more than 10 mm Hg above goal should be started on two
antihypertensives simultaneously. Combination therapy with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill may
lower blood pressure more quickly with minimal adverse effects. A variety of combination formulations of the
various pharmacologic classes are available to increase ease of patient adherence to treatment regimens that require
multiple medications.

guidelines for hypertension. ACC = American College of Cardiology; ACE = angiotensin

609
A.  Individualized care
Hypertension may coexist with other conditions that can be aggravated by some of the antihypertensive drugs or that
may benefit from the use of some antihypertensive drugs independent of blood pressure control. In such cases, it is
important to match antihypertensive drugs to the particular patient. Figure 16.6 shows preferred therapies in
hypertensive patients with concomitant diseases. In addition to the choice of therapy, blood pressure goals may also
be individualized based on concurrent disease states and age (Figure 16.5).
Figure 16.6 Treatment of hypertension in patients with concomitant diseases. [Note:
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are an alternative to angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.]
610
V.  Diuretics
For all classes of diuretics, the initial mechanism of action is based upon decreasing blood volume, which ultimately
leads to decreased blood pressure. Routine serum electrolyte monitoring should be done for all patients receiving
diuretics. A complete discussion of the actions, therapeutic uses, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of diuretics
can be found in Chapter 17.
611
A.  Thiazide diuretics
Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide [hye-droe-klor-oh-THYE-a-zide] and chlorthalidone [klor-THAL-
ih-done], lower blood pressure initially by increasing sodium and water excretion. This causes a decrease in
extracellular volume, resulting in a decrease in cardiac output and renal blood flow (Figure 16.7). With long-term
treatment, plasma volume approaches a normal value, but a hypotensive effect persists that is related to a decrease in
peripheral resistance. Thiazide diuretics can be used as initial drug therapy for hypertension unless there are
compelling reasons to choose another agent. Thiazides are useful in combination therapy with a variety of other
antihypertensive agents, including β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and potassium-sparing diuretics. With the
exception of metolazone [me-TOL-ah-zone], thiazide diuretics are not effective in patients with inadequate kidney
function (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/m2). Loop diuretics may be required in these
patients. Thiazide diuretics can induce hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and, to a lesser extent, hyperglycemia in some
patients.
Figure 16.7 Actions of thiazide diuretics.
612
B.  Loop diuretics
The loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, and ethacrynic acid; see Chapter 17) act promptly by
blocking sodium and chloride reabsorption in the kidneys, even in patients with poor renal function or those who
have not responded to thiazide diuretics. Loop diuretics cause decreased renal vascular resistance and increased
renal blood flow. Like thiazides, they can cause hypokalemia. However, unlike thiazides, loop diuretics increase the
calcium content of urine, whereas thiazide diuretics decrease it. These agents are rarely used alone to treat
hypertension, but they are commonly used to manage symptoms of heart failure and edema.
613
C.  Potassium-sparing diuretics
Amiloride [a-MIL-oh-ride] and triamterene [tri-AM-ter-een] are inhibitors of epithelial sodium transport at the late
distal and collecting ducts, and spironolactone [speer-on-oh-LAK-tone] and eplerenone [eh-PLEH-reh-none] are
aldosterone receptor antagonists. All of these agents reduce potassium loss in the urine. Aldosterone antagonists
have the additional benefit of diminishing the cardiac remodeling that occurs in heart failure (see Chapter 18).
Potassium-sparing diuretics are sometimes used in combination with loop diuretics and thiazides to reduce the
amount of potassium loss induced by these diuretics.
614
VI.  β-Adrenoceptor–Blocking Agents
β-Blockers are a treatment option for hypertensive patients with concomitant heart disease or heart failure (Figure
16.6).
615
A.  Actions
The β-blockers reduce blood pressure primarily by decreasing cardiac output (Figure 16.8). They may also decrease
sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) and inhibit the release of renin from the kidneys, thus
decreasing the formation of angiotensin II and the secretion of aldosterone. The prototype β-blocker is propranolol
[proe-PRAN-oh-lol], which acts at both β1 and β2 receptors. Selective blockers of β1 receptors, such as metoprolol
[met-OH-pro-lol] and atenolol [ah-TEN-oh-lol], are among the most commonly prescribed β-blockers. Nebivolol
[ne-BIV-oh-lole] is a selective blocker of β1 receptors, which also increases the production of nitric oxide, leading to
vasodilation. The selective β-blockers may be administered cautiously to hypertensive patients who also have
asthma. The nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma due to their blockade of β2-
mediated bronchodilation. (See Chapter 7 for an in-depth discussion of β-blockers.) β-Blockers should be used
cautiously in the treatment of patients with acute heart failure or peripheral vascular disease.
Figure 16.8 Actions of β-adrenoceptor–blocking agents.
616
B.  Therapeutic uses
The primary therapeutic benefits of β-blockers are seen in hypertensive patients with concomitant heart disease,
such as supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (for example, atrial fibrillation), previous myocardial infarction, stable
ischemic heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Conditions that discourage the use of β-blockers include reversible
bronchospastic disease such as asthma, second- and third-degree heart block, and severe peripheral vascular disease.
617
C.  Pharmacokinetics
The β-blockers are orally active for the treatment of hypertension. Propranolol undergoes extensive and highly
variable first-pass metabolism. Oral β-blockers may take several weeks to develop their full effects. Esmolol,
metoprolol, and propranolol are available in intravenous formulations.
618
D.  Adverse effects
1.  Common effects
Figure 16.9 describes some of the adverse effects of β-blockers. The β-blockers may decrease libido and cause
erectile dysfunction, which can severely reduce patient compliance.
619
Figure 16.9 Some adverse effects of β-blockers.
620
2.  Alterations in serum lipid patterns
Noncardioselective β-blockers may disturb lipid metabolism, decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
increasing triglycerides.
3.  Drug withdrawal
Abrupt withdrawal may induce severe hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction, and even sudden death in
patients with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, these drugs must be tapered over a few weeks in patients with
hypertension and ischemic heart disease.
621
VII.  ACE Inhibitors
ACE inhibitors such as captopril [KAP-toe-pril], enalapril [e-NAL-ah-pril], and lisinopril [lye-SIN-oh-pril] are
recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension in patients with a variety of compelling indications, including
high coronary disease risk or history of diabetes, stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, or chronic kidney
disease (Figure 16.6).
